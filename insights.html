NON-GAAP AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES Part II . Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K makes reference to non-GAAP and other financial measures, including EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Management uses EBITDA to assess performance of Enbridge and to set targets. Management believes the presentation of EBITDA gives useful information to investors as it provides increased transparency and insight into the performance of Enbridge. The non-GAAP and other financial measures are not measures that have a standardized meaning prescribed by the accounting principles generally accepted in the US (US GAAP) and are not US GAAP measures. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other issuers. A reconciliation of historical non- GAAP and other financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is set out in this MD&A and is available on our website. Additional information on non-GAAP and other financial measures may be found on our website, www.sedarplus.ca or www.sec.gov. 8

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Enbridge is a leading North American energy infrastructure company. Our core businesses include Liquids Pipelines, which consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport and export various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons; Gas Transmission, which consists of investments in natural gas pipelines and gathering and processing facilities in Canada and the US; Gas Distribution and Storage, which consists of natural gas utility operations that serve residential, commercial and industrial customers in Canada and the US; and Renewable Power Generation, which consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as geothermal and power transmission assets, in North America and Europe. Enbridge is a public company, with common shares that trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ENB. We were incorporated on April 13, 1970 under the Companies Ordinance of the Northwest Territories and were continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on December 15, 1987. A more detailed description of each of our businesses and underlying assets is provided below under Business Segments . CORPORATE VISION AND STRATEGY VISION Enbridge through its diversified businesses, fuels people’s quality of life in a safe and socially responsible manner in North America and beyond. Our vision is to provide energy in a planet-friendly way, everywhere people need it. In pursuing this vision, we seek to play a critical role in enabling the economic and social well-being of society by providing access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy through our infrastructure which transports, distributes, and generates energy, including liquids, natural gas, renewable power, and low-carbon fuels. We recognize that the energy system is changing, and we aim to provide a bridge to a cleaner energy future in a socially-responsible way, including selectively investing in lower-carbon energy technologies. We aim to be a first-choice investment, supported by our investor value proposition of predictable and stable cash flows, a strong investment grade balance sheet to facilitate growth, a history of dividend increases, and a diversified opportunity set of growth projects in multiple jurisdictions to support continued EBITDA and distributable cash flow per share growth. Our assets are underpinned by long-term contracts, regulated cost-of-service tolling frameworks, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and other low-risk commercial arrangements. We strive to be the leading first-choice energy delivery company in North America and beyond—for customers, communities, investors, regulators, policymakers, and employees. We approach this goal with a focus on worker and public safety, stakeholder relations, customer service, community investment, sustainability leadership, and employee engagement and satisfaction. As part of our community engagement, we remain committed to meaningful dialogue with Indigenous peoples to achieve common goals and constructive outcomes from our projects and operations. We also are committed to advancing investment opportunities with Indigenous groups, as demonstrated by recent partnerships on our oil pipelines and in the development of renewable energy projects. 9

Page 10
STRATEGY Our strategy is underpinned by a deep understanding of both local and global energy supply and demand fundamentals. Through disciplined capital allocation, aligned with our outlook on energy markets, we have become an industry leader with a diversified portfolio of infrastructure super systems across the North American continent, creating a platform for incremental growth. Our robust pipeline of project development opportunities, the integration of recent strategic acquisitions, and ongoing efficiency improvements are expected to drive our business forward. We remain confident in our balanced growth strategy and expect to continue to invest in our diversified footprint of both conventional businesses and complementary lower-carbon platforms. This includes extension and expansion opportunities to meet LNG exports and offshore gas, as well as leveraging North American electrification trends, including the expansion of data centers, where we can provide integrated customer solutions through our natural gas and renewable power businesses. Additionally, we are committed to effectively managing our emissions from our operations and building lasting and inclusive relationships with our stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples, our customers and employees. Our assets have reliably generated low-risk, resilient cash flows through many different commodity, economic, and geopolitical environments. We believe that our asset quality, diversity, and ability to provide comprehensive solutions to customers which leverages expertise across our four business lines are key differentiators that enable us to be flexible in an uncertain business environment. In order to continue to be an industry leader and to create value over the short and long term, we maintain a robust strategic planning process. We regularly conduct scenario and resiliency analysis on both our assets and business strategy. We test various value enhancement and maximization options, and we regularly engage with our Board of Directors (the Board) to promote alignment and maintain active oversight. This Board participation includes updates and discussions throughout the year and a dedicated annual strategic planning session. Going forward, we will continue to use this comprehensive approach to guide our investment decisions. Consistent with our strategy, we have progressed several of our priorities in 2024. For example: • We completed the acquisition of the US Gas Utilities with operations in Idaho, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah and Wyoming, creating the largest natural gas utility franchise in North America, providing visible, low-risk, long-term, rate base growth. • Our Liquids Pipelines business exported record volumes through our Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC), received approval from the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) in 2024 for our Mainline Tolling negotiated settlement through to 2028, sanctioned an expansion of the Gray Oak pipeline and incremental capacity at the EIEC following successful open seasons, and acquired marine docks with land adjacent to EIEC, further advancing our Permian export strategy. • Our Gas Transmission business reached a negotiated settlement with shippers on Texas Eastern, announced and closed the Whistler Parent JV, a joint venture formed by Enbridge, WhiteWater/I Squared Capital and MPLX LP, connecting Permian Basin natural gas supply to growing LNG and other US Gulf Coast demand, and achieved final investment decision on the Tennessee Ridgeline Expansion and Blackcomb Natural Gas Pipeline. We also expanded our footprint in the Gulf Coast by sanctioning the Canyon System Pipelines and the formation of a joint venture to service the Sparta offshore development to serve BP, Shell and Equinor Gulf Coast developments. We also expanded our exposure to LNG by sanctioning the Venice Extension Project, which supplies the Venture Global Plaquemines LNG facility. We continue to work with customers on opportunities to supply new gas- fired power generation relating to data centers and growth of electricity demand generally, and capitalize on strong gas fundamentals to deliver safe, reliable, and lower-carbon energy to North Americans while simultaneously growing LNG exports. 10

Page 11
• Our Gas Distribution and Storage business continued to advance its incentive regulation rate application in Ontario by filing a settlement proposal for the second phase of our 2024 rebasing application with the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), added approximately 36,000 new customers across our Ontario utilities business, commenced the integration of the Acquisitions, including its three million customers, and capitalized on increasing electric power and industrial demand - for example, by contracting gas supply to provide 200 megawatts (MW) of data center power in Utah and building the Moriah Energy Center, a 2 billion cubic feet LNG facility, to enable system growth and maintain reliability in North Carolina. We remain committed to assessing low-risk, capital investment opportunities, and providing cost-effective, reliable and lower-carbon energy to customers in Ontario, Quebec, Ohio, North Carolina, Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho. • Our Renewable Power Generation business continued to execute on growth opportunities, including through our onshore business with the sanctioning of Orange Grove Solar in Texas (backed by a PPA with AT&T), Sequoia Solar in Texas (backed by a PPA with AT&T and Toyota), completion of Fox Squirrel Solar Phase 2 and 3 in Ohio (backed by a PPA with Amazon), and the announcement of the Seven Stars Energy Project, our first renewable power indigenous partnership focused on wind energy generation in Saskatchewan. We also continued to progress opportunities in our Offshore Wind business in Europe, including placing the Fécamp project into service, delivering first power to the French grid from the Provence Grand Large floating offshore wind project and more recently, winning an offshore wind farm tender for a project in the Mediterranean Sea off the southern coast of France. • We continued to make meaningful progress towards our ESG goals. We further strengthened our relationships with Indigenous communities across North America while advancing our reconciliation commitments as a part of our Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan, meeting 12 of 22 commitments. We are striving to reduce emissions from our operations through multiple pathways, including system modernization, and continued investment in our lower-carbon businesses. • We continue to recycle capital at attractive valuations; in 2024, this included completing the sale of our interests in the Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable facility. We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation, portfolio optimization and diversification, the continued enhancement of our industry leading cash flow profile and financial strength and flexibility. In addition, we continue to prioritize operating cost reductions across our business to increase our competitiveness and profitability. 11

Page 12
These achievements are discussed in further detail in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Looking ahead, our near-term strategic priorities remain similar to past years. As always, proactively advancing the safety of our assets, protecting the environment, and maintaining system reliability remain our top priorities. We are focused on enhancing the value of our existing assets through further optimization, capitalizing on our extensive infrastructure to meet evolving customer needs, prioritizing in- franchise organic growth and export-driven opportunities, and continuing to develop lower-carbon platforms across all our businesses. As an example, we are continuing to pursue opportunities related to electrification in North America, where we can utilize our existing gas transmission and distribution infrastructure to safely deliver gas to new and existing power plants being developed, given surging power demand. We are also pursuing opportunities to build new natural gas infrastructure along our network and within our gas distribution territories, combined with providing gas supply and storage to customers, to support this growth. To complement our natural gas offerings, we are also able to provide renewable energy solutions (electricity and renewable credits/offsets) to customers, which we view as a strategic competitive advantage, enabling us to expand our customer base and further extend our growth. We expect to continue to invest on an attractive, risk-adjusted basis to advance our strategy and build a sustainable competitive advantage. Our key strategic priorities include: Safety and Operational Reliability Safety and operational reliability are the foundation of our strategy. We strive to achieve and maintain industry leadership in all facets of safety - process, public, and personal - and ensure the highest standards of reliability and integrity across our system to protect our communities and the environment. Extend Growth The cornerstone of our growth lies in the successful execution of our slate of secured projects (currently $26 billion through 2029) on schedule and within estimated costs, while maintaining standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction, and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects . We continue to seek additional high-quality growth opportunities across all our platforms, and deploy capital towards optimal uses, prioritizing balance sheet strength, investment in low capital intensity growth, and regulated utility or utility-like projects. Our scale and diversification drive competitive advantages across the enterprise and generate opportunities for collaboration across the business units. The four business segments we operate share commercial advantages and strong stakeholder relationships that enable opportunities to cross-sell to customers across the business units, providing additional value and the potential for future growth. We will carefully assess our remaining investable capacity, deploying capital to the most value-enhancing opportunities available to us, including further organic growth, and complementary accretive "tuck-in" acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning or further strengthen our balance sheet. 12

Page 13
Looking ahead, we see strong utilization of our network and opportunities for growth within each of our businesses. For example, we expect that: • Our liquids pipelines infrastructure will remain a vital connection between key supply basins and demand-pull markets such as the refinery hubs in the US Midwest, eastern Canada, and the US Gulf Coast. We are advancing discussions with customers for additional Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin pipeline capacity in 2026 and beyond. We will continue to explore capital efficient growth opportunities via system expansions and optimization of operations. Our export infrastructure will also enable the transportation of crude oil, cleaner fuels, and other export opportunities. Building on our early experience, we expect that carbon capture and storage (CCS) offers the potential to provide additional new growth opportunities within our footprint in jurisdictions with supportive regulatory regimes. • Our natural gas transmission business will seek extension and expansion opportunities driven by new load demand from gas-fired power generation (including for data centers, electrification, and reshoring), industrial growth, and coastal LNG plants. The strategic asset position we possess produces opportunities to accelerate growth and meet customer needs. Our rate regulated cost-of- service business model creates secured growth opportunities that yield predictable, low-risk cash flows. We are also focused on facilitating the connection of new gas supply to key demand centers and the build-out of our Permian gas value chain. Looking forward, we expect the integration of producing and blending RNG into our system to enhance asset longevity, enable us to offer differentiated lower-carbon solutions to customers and further decarbonize our gas offerings. • Our North American gas distribution and storage business will continue to grow through customer additions and modernization investments. Data center driven demand presents an opportunity for the business to expand services by fueling natural gas power plants. We believe system and storage enhancements in the business will increase system flexibility, reliability, and price stability for customers. • Our renewable power business continues to be well positioned to capitalize on the growth of renewables in North America and Europe through disciplined investment in diversified renewable technologies and selective development in supportive jurisdictions where we have an established presence. We will continue to leverage our strong internal capabilities and our existing partnerships to successfully execute our large development portfolio. In addition, we aim to drive growth with a focus on optimization, modernization, productivity, and efficiency across all our businesses. Examples include: the application of drag-reducing agents and pump station modifications to optimize throughput on our liquids system, the execution of toll settlements and rate case filings to optimize revenue within our liquids pipeline and gas transmission franchises, the expansion of lower-carbon gas offerings to modernize and integrate value chains at our gas utilities, and the creation of sustainable cost savings across the organization through innovation, process improvement and system enhancements. Maintain Financial Strength and Flexibility Our financing strategies are designed to retain strong, investment-grade credit ratings so that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions. We expect that the current secured capital program can be readily financed through an equity self-funded model. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources . 13

Page 14
Disciplined Capital Allocation We assess the latest fundamental trends, monitor the business landscape, and proactively conduct business development activities with the goal of identifying an industry-leading capital deployment opportunity set. We screen, analyze, and assess these opportunities using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of effectively deploying capital to grow while achieving attractive risk- adjusted returns, within our low-risk "utility-like" business model. All investment opportunities are evaluated based on their potential to advance our strategy, mitigate risks, support our ESG goals, and create additional financial flexibility. Our primary emphasis in the near term is on low capital intensity opportunities to enhance returns across existing businesses (organic expansions and optimizations), system modernization, and utility rate-based investments. We also continue to assess other strong value-enhancing opportunities, including accretive acquisitions that can complement our portfolio. In evaluating typical investment opportunities, we also consider other potential capital allocation alternatives. Other alternatives for capital deployment depend on our current outlook and include further debt reduction, dividend increases, and share buy-backs. Participate in Energy Transition Over Time As the global population grows and standards of living continue to improve around the world, we expect energy demand to rise. We, and our society, increasingly recognize the need for secure and reliable energy while concurrently reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accordingly, energy systems around the world are being gradually reshaped as industry participants, regulators, and consumers seek to balance these factors. As a diversified energy infrastructure company, we believe that we are well positioned to play a role in the energy transition by lowering the emissions-intensity of the conventional fuels we transport and store, supporting the switching from higher emission energy sources to lower-carbon options for our customers, and selectively developing and constructing future lower- carbon energy infrastructure. We believe that diversification and innovation will play a significant role in the energy transition. To date, we have made significant investments in natural gas infrastructure, emissions reduction technologies, and renewable energy assets, helping to decrease our emissions and further expand our platforms to support the global energy transition. Our focus areas in renewable energy remain in utility-scale onshore solar and wind projects, and integrated clean-energy offerings and solutions for customers. We are also participating in the development of other lower-carbon platforms like RNG, blue ammonia, CCS, and hydrogen gas (H2) where we can leverage our infrastructure, capabilities, and stakeholder relationships to accelerate growth and extend the value of our existing assets. Additionally, potential new investments are evaluated to assess their alignment with our GHG emissions reduction goals. We work closely with our customers and stakeholders to maintain a pulse on the pace of the energy transition and are actively leveraging our execution capabilities and sustainability leadership to advance our positioning as a differentiated energy provider. We regularly test our assets under various transition scenarios to assess the resiliency of our business. STRATEGIC ENABLERS To successfully execute on our strategy and build competitive advantage, we focus on maintaining leading-edge capabilities in sustainability, talent, technology, operations, development, and growth capabilities. Sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance Sustainability is integral to our ability to deliver energy in a safe and reliable manner. How well we perform as a steward of our environment; as a safe operator of essential energy infrastructure; as an inclusive employer; and as a responsible corporate citizen is inextricably linked to our ability to achieve our strategic priorities and create long-term value for all our stakeholders. 14

Talent Our workforce is essential to our success and our focus remains on enhancing the capabilities and skills of our people. We are evolving our talent strategy enhancing our employee experience, and elevating our focus on learning and development. We value diversity of thought, and the focus on our approach to people leadership drives business performance. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry-competitive compensation, flexibility, and retention programs that provide both short- and long-term performance incentives. We prioritize inclusion, along with our other business strategies because it is fundamentally important to our values and culture. Technology We recognize the vital role technology plays in helping us achieve our strategic objectives. We are committed to pursuing innovation and technology solutions that further our safety and reliability, maximize revenues, reduce costs, and enable transition to new, cleaner energy solutions. We continue to focus on resilience and reliability of our systems from a cybersecurity perspective and work to enhance our capabilities and educate our workforce to protect our critical infrastructure system from increasing threats. We also announced a collaboration with Microsoft leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to drive advancements in safety, emissions reductions, and asset optimization. Growth Capabilities To achieve our vision and mission, we emphasize specific capabilities that will help us grow and build competitive advantage within our core and potential new businesses. We are increasing our focus on our customers so that we are responsive to their needs while also proactively helping them meet their decarbonization objectives. We are continuing to invest in leading corporate development capabilities to ensure we identify and execute on attractive capital recycling opportunities and acquisitions. Finally, we believe that the future energy system will not only continue to be highly integrated, but also become more complex. This will require an ecosystem of stakeholders to develop and manage from customers and lenders to equipment manufacturers and regulators. We believe it is critical to have strengths in partnership structuring and relationship management to build and maintain the robust energy infrastructure systems. BUSINESS SEGMENTS During 2024, our activities were carried out through four business segments: Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Renewable Power Generation, as discussed below. 16

Page 17
LIQUIDS PIPELINES Liquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport and export various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons, which delivers approximately six million barrels per day (mmbpd) and is the largest global crude oil and liquids network. 17

Page 18
MAINLINE SYSTEM The Mainline System is a common carrier pipeline comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline transports various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/US border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the US/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined operating capacity of approximately 3.2 mmbpd that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/US border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada. Through our predecessors, we have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the Mainline System in the US. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid hydrocarbons from western Canada to the US. Tolling Framework The Mainline Tolling Settlement (MTS) is a negotiated settlement with a term of seven and a half years through the end of 2028 that covers both the Canadian and US portions of the Mainline, except for Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. Enbridge filed an application with the CER for approval of the MTS on December 15, 2023 and the CER issued an order on March 4, 2024 approving Enbridge’s application as filed. The MTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll for deliveries within western Canada, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada, on the Canadian Mainline, and delivered into the US, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. Under the MTS, the Mainline operates as a common carrier system available to all shippers on a monthly nomination basis. The MTS includes: • an IJT, for heavy crude oil movements from Hardisty to Chicago, comprised of an initial Canadian Mainline Toll of $1.65 per barrel plus an initial Lakehead System Toll of US$2.57 per barrel, plus the applicable Line 3 Replacement surcharge; • toll escalation for operation, administration, and power costs tied to US consumer price and US and Canadian power indices; • tolls that are distance and commodity adjusted, and utilize a dual currency IJT; and • a financial performance collar that provides incentives for Enbridge to optimize throughput and cost, but also provides downside protection in the event of extreme supply or demand disruptions or unforeseen operating cost exposure. This performance collar is intended to ensure the Mainline earns 11% to 14.5% returns, on a deemed 50% equity capitalization. Approximately 70% of Mainline deliveries are tolled under this settlement, while approximately 30% of deliveries are tolled on a full path basis to markets downstream of the Mainline. Lakehead System Local Tolls Transportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/US border near Neche, North Dakota, Clearbrook, Minnesota and other points to principal delivery points on the Lakehead System. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual inflationary adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing base rates and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1 of each year. 18

Page 19
The Lakehead tolls are subject to an Offer of Settlement approved by the FERC on November 27, 2023 (Lakehead System Settlement). Lakehead System tolls were revised to reflect the terms of the Lakehead System Settlement effective December 1, 2023. The Lakehead System Settlement includes: • a resolution of litigation related to the index portion of the Lakehead System rate; and • a depreciation truncation date of December 31, 2048 for the rate base applicable to the Index and Facilities Surcharge and agreement on the terms for future recovery through the Facilities Surcharge of costs related to two Line 5 projects: the Wisconsin Relocation Project and the Straits of Mackinac Tunnel. REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEM The Regional Oil Sands System includes seven intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines: the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland and Woodland Extension Pipelines, Wood Buffalo and Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which provide connectivity for several oil sands customers to the Edmonton and Hardisty areas. The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines is approximately 1,120 thousand barrels per day (kbpd) to Edmonton and 1,415 kbpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218 kbpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. We have a 50% interest in the Woodland Pipeline and a 70% interest in Norlite. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that provide cash flow stability and also include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system. On October 5, 2022, we completed a transaction with Athabasca Indigenous Investments Limited Partnership (Aii), a newly created entity representing 23 First Nation and Metis communities, pursuant to which Aii acquired an 11.6% non-operating interest in the seven intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines in the Regional Oil Sands System. GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENT Gulf Coast includes Flanagan South, Spearhead Pipeline, Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), the Mid-Continent System (Cushing Terminal), Gray Oak, and the EIEC. Flanagan South is a 950 kilometer (590 mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South has a capacity of approximately 700 kbpd. Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead Pipeline has a capacity of approximately 193 kbpd. We have a 50% interest in the 1,078 kilometer (670 mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805 kilometer (500 mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Total aggregate capacity on the Seaway Pipeline system is approximately 950 kbpd. The Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast. 19

Page 20
The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing Terminal, consisting of over 110 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78 to 570 thousand barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 26 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder is contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, and blending fees. Gray Oak is a 1,368 kilometer (850 mile) crude oil system, transporting light crude oil, with origination points in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basins in West Texas. Gray Oak has delivery points at the US Gulf Coast and Houston refining region and currently has an average annual capacity of 900 kbpd; a planned expansion in 2025 will increase average annual capacity to 1,020 kbpd. Our effective economic interest in Gray Oak is 68.5% after our acquisition of Rattler Midstream’s 10% interest in the pipeline in 2023. We assumed operatorship of Gray Oak in April 2023. In October 2021, we acquired 100% of Moda Midstream Operating, LLC, which includes the EIEC, the largest crude oil export terminal by volume in North America. EIEC has an export capability of 1.6 million barrels per day. In 2024 we added a further 2 million barrels of storage at EIEC, bringing EIEC’s total storage capability to 17.6 million barrels. We also own 100% interest in each of the 300-kbpd Viola pipeline, and the 350-thousand barrel Taft Terminal, both located near Corpus Christi, Texas. Additionally, in October 2024 we completed the acquisition of two marine docks and land adjacent to EIEC from Flint Hills Resources. This acquisition will add crude oil export capacity and streamline existing EIEC operations by increasing Very Large Crude Carrier windows on the primary facility docks. In November 2022, we acquired an additional 10% ownership interest in Cactus II Pipeline, a pipeline that travels from Wink to Ingleside within Texas, bringing our total non-operating ownership to 30%. OTHER Other includes Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and Feeder Pipelines and Other. The Southern Lights Pipeline is a single stream 180 kbpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. Both the Canadian portion and the US portions of the Southern Lights Pipeline receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. The Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes. A fully subscribed open season was completed in December 2023, which has ensured contract levels remain at 90% through mid-2030. The Express-Platte System consists of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736 kilometer (1,700 mile) long crude oil transportation system, which begins at Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates at Wood River, Illinois. The 310 kbpd Express Pipeline carries crude oil to US refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The 145 to 164 kbpd Platte Pipeline, which interconnects with the Express Pipeline at Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the Midwest. The Express Pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of the Express Pipeline capacity and all of the Platte Pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month. 20

Page 21
The Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken Basin in North Dakota and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook, Minnesota for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipelines. The interstate portion of the system has both US and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba. Tariffs on the US portion of the North Dakota System are regulated by the FERC. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis. We have an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken Basin in North Dakota to markets in eastern Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADD) II and the US Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the Dakota Access Pipeline from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Current capacity is approximately 750 kbpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers. Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the US. Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) Pipeline which originates in Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. We have an effective 65% interest in the 300 kbpd SAX pipeline. The majority of the SAX Pipeline's capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480 thousand barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The 180 kbpd Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The 45 kbpd NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost-of-service rate structure based on established terms with shippers. CRUDE OIL MARKETING The Liquids Pipelines segment also includes the Crude Oil Marketing business in Canada and the US, which provides physical commodity marketing and logistical services to North American refiners, producers, and other customers. The business is primarily focused on servicing customers across the value chain and capturing value from quality, time, and location price differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, the Crude Oil Marketing business transports and stores on both Enbridge-owned and third-party assets using a combination of contracted pipeline, storage, railcar, and truck capacity agreements. COMPETITION Competition for our liquids pipelines network comes primarily from infrastructure or logistics alternatives (e.g., rail or trucking) that transport liquid hydrocarbons from production basins in which we operate to markets in Canada, the US and internationally. Competition from existing pipelines, such as the recently completed Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, is based primarily on access to supply, end use markets, the cost of transportation, contract structure and the quality and reliability of service. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently served by pipelines. 21

Page 22
We believe that our liquids pipelines systems will continue to provide competitive and attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), North Dakota, and the Permian Basin, due to our market access, competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers. Earnings from our Crude Oil Marketing business are primarily generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage strategies could have an impact on our earnings. Efforts to mitigate competition risk include diversification of the marketing business by transacting at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients and pipelines. SUPPLY AND DEMAND We have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the US, the world’s largest market for crude oil. We expect US demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future. Under most base case forecasts, demand is expected to grow into the next decade, primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), such as India and broader Southeast Asia. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to slow down over time due to vehicle fuel efficiency improvement and rising adoption of electric vehicles. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to continue to balance markets and manage prices with production quotas despite accelerated developments of offshore production in both Brazil and Guyana and continued growth from Canada and the US. In the US, growth will likely be driven by the Permian Basin, a large and cost competitive light crude oil resource base. In addition, heavy crude oil growth is expected from the WCSB as additional egress availability will likely support expansion of existing projects and some potential new greenfield facilities. Our Mainline System was effectively fully utilized in 2024 delivering 3.1 mmbpd. Refinery demand in the upper Midwest PADD II market has been strong. On the US Gulf Coast, lower supply of heavy crude from Latin America and the Middle East continues to drive increased demand for Canadian heavy crude. Many of the refineries connected to the Mainline System are complex and competitive in the global context. The anticipated combination of long-term demand growth in non-OECD nations, domestic demand contraction over time, and continued production growth in the Permian Basin and WCSB, highlights the importance of our strategic asset footprint and reinforces the need for additional export-oriented infrastructure. We believe that we are well positioned to meet these evolving supply and demand fundamentals through expansion of system capacity for incremental access to the US Gulf Coast, and through further development of our EIEC in Corpus Christi, including the full integration and optimization of the Flint Hills marine docks and land acquired in October 2024. Opposition to fossil fuel development in conjunction with evolving consumer preferences and new technologies could underpin energy transition scenarios impacting long-term supply and demand of crude oil. We continue to closely monitor the evolution of all of these factors to be able to proactively adapt our business to help meet our customers’ and society’s energy needs. These supply and demand dynamics are evolving, as the current political climate in Canada and the US continues to shift, including as a result of changes in governments and trade relations. We continue to monitor these developments together with their impact on our business. 22

We have a 15% interest in DBR. Transmission and storage services are generally provided under firm agreements where customers reserve capacity in pipelines and storage facilities. The vast majority of these agreements provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of the actual volumes transported on the pipelines, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported, injected or withdrawn, which is intended to recover variable costs. Interruptible transmission and storage services are also available where customers can use capacity if it exists at the time of the request and are generally at a higher toll than long-term contracted rates. Interruptible revenues depend on the amount of volumes transported or stored and the associated rates for this service. Storage operations also provide a variety of other value-added services including natural gas parking, loaning and balancing services to meet customers’ needs. CANADIAN GAS TRANSMISSION Canadian Gas Transmission is comprised of Westcoast Energy Inc.’s (Westcoast) British Columbia (BC) Pipeline, and other minor midstream gas gathering pipelines. It also includes the Aitken Creek Gas Storage facility, located in BC, Canada, which we acquired on November 1, 2023. The BC Pipeline provides natural gas transmission services, transporting processed natural gas from facilities located primarily in northeastern BC to markets in BC and the US Pacific Northwest. It has a peak day capacity of 3.6 bcf/d of natural gas on approximately 2,950 kilometers (1,833 miles) of transmission pipeline in BC and Alberta, as well as associated mainline compressor stations. BC Pipeline is regulated by the CER under cost-of-service regulation. 25

Page 26
The majority of transportation services provided by Canadian Gas Transmission are under firm agreements, which provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of actual volumes transported on the pipeline, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported to recover variable costs. Canadian Gas Transmission also provides interruptible transmission services where customers can use capacity if it is available at the time of request. Payments under these services are based on volumes transported. US MIDSTREAM US Midstream includes a 13.2% effective economic interest in DCP Midstream, LP (DCP). Prior to August 17, 2022, we had a 28.3% effective economic interest in DCP. DCP is a joint venture, with a diversified portfolio of assets, engaged in the business of gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing and selling natural gas; producing, fractionating, transporting, storing and selling NGL; and recovering and selling condensate. DCP owns and operates more than 32 plants and approximately 86,016 kilometers (53,448 miles) of natural gas and NGL pipelines, with operations in nine states across major producing regions. OTHER Other consists primarily of our offshore assets. Enbridge Offshore Pipelines is comprised of 12 natural gas gathering and FERC regulated transmission pipelines and five oil pipelines. These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf Coast, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,200 kilometers (1,365 miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.6 bcf/d. In 2023, Enbridge acquired a 10% equity investment in Divert Inc., a RNG infrastructure company, which provides Enbridge with an option to invest up to $1.3 billion (US$1.0 billion) in food waste to RNG projects across the US. On January 2, 2024, we acquired six Morrow Renewables operating landfill gas-to-RNG production facilities located in Texas and Arkansas. The acquired assets align with and advance our low-carbon strategy. COMPETITION Our natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service. The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, nuclear and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors. Competitors predominantly include interstate/interprovincial and intrastate/intraprovincial pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGL. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Our gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in supply and demand markets over the last decade, and we expect to continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves. 26

Page 27
Natural gas production in the Appalachian and Permian Basins has grown dramatically in the past decade. Today, these regions produce more than 54 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling have increased the supply of low-cost natural gas. As well, there has been, and continues to be, a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of both producers and consumers. Our US Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply-constrained northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse bi-directional supply to the northeast, southeast, Midwest, Gulf Coast and LNG markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis. The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady demand. The bi-directional capabilities offered by our US Gas Transmission system allow us to deliver in an efficient manner to our regional customers. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region. The southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long-term, utility-like arrangements. With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our Westcoast Pipeline, the Midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region is expected to remain stable over the next decade, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal-fired generation. Gulf Coast demand growth is being driven by an increase in the volume of LNG exports, an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand in these markets in the region is anticipated to grow by approximately 20 bcf/d through 2040. The Gulf Coast market has been the beneficiary of low-cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost-effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide-water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline and LNG exports continue their growth trajectory. In 2024, the US exported over 12 bcf/d of natural gas to LNG markets, primarily from the Gulf Coast region. Western Canada is also a source of low-cost supply seeking access to premium markets in North America and globally. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the Pacific Northwest is our BC Pipeline, which is highly utilized. The continental supply profile has shifted to natural gas shale plays such as the Montney and Duvernay within western Canada. These plays are expected to fulfill an integral role as Canada enters the global market as an LNG exporter. Western Canada's production is forecasted to increase from 18 bcf/d in 2024 to 23 bcf/d by 2040. This growth will support an additional 5 bcf/d of LNG exports. These supply shifts have shaped our growth strategies and affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital expenditures discussed below in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects. 27

Page 28
Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 20% by 2050, according to the recently released 2024 International Energy Agency (IEA) report, driven primarily by economic growth in non- OECD countries. According to the IEA Stated Policy Scenario, natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand, and gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 16% during this period as one of the world’s most significant energy sources. North American exports are expected to play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America, as well as for the further build-out of export facilities to meet international demand. The long-term effects on global gas markets of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine remain uncertain. In 2022, Europe saw a sharp rise in natural gas prices due to a decrease in supply from Russia. Global LNG markets responded, and LNG cargoes were redirected from the Asian market to Europe which allowed Europe to meet peak demand during what turned out to be a mild winter. Natural gas storage volumes have been strong entering the 2024-2025 winter season in Europe, and mild winter temperatures have thus far helped to moderate prices. The outlook for gas prices remains somewhat volatile but is generally anticipated to see a gradual normalization as LNG export volumes are expected to ramp up in 2026-2027. Europe continues to seek lower-carbon gas supplies and has accelerated plans to develop hydrogen as an alternative to natural gas. The global hydrogen market is still relatively immature, but with the introduction of new incentives, such as those in the US Inflation Reduction Act and the regulations enacted thereunder, hydrogen production at large scale is becoming increasingly commercialized, which has led to a growing export market. Given its proximity to low-cost natural gas supplies and suitable geologic storage for carbon dioxide, the US Gulf Coast is well positioned to be a leading export hub to supply blue hydrogen to international markets. Given these rapidly changing global fundamentals and coupled with growing appetite for lower-carbon hydrogen, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers and meet both regional and international demand. Opposition to natural gas development, including new pipeline projects, exists in certain jurisdictions, which may challenge continued growth of the North American gas market and the ability to efficiently connect supply and demand. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and US gas transportation facilities. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects . RNG is seen as a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional natural gas, as it is derived from organic waste sources such as agricultural residues, food waste, and other organic waste material. The production process most commonly involves the anaerobic digestion of these organic materials, resulting in the generation of biogas composed primarily of methane. Unlike conventional natural gas, RNG is considered carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative, as the carbon dioxide that is ultimately released during combustion is offset by the carbon captured during the organic matter's growth. This closed-loop cycle can contribute to mitigating GHG emissions and help to address climate change concerns. RNG can be seamlessly integrated into existing natural gas infrastructure, offering a versatile energy source for heating, transportation, and electricity generation. As societies increasingly prioritize reducing emissions, RNG has the potential to play an important role in the transition towards a cleaner and more resilient energy future. Global RNG consumption is expected to increase with a 11% compound annual growth rate until 2050, according to IEA's recently released Stated Policy Scenario. These supply and demand dynamics are evolving, as the current political climate in Canada and the US continues to shift, including as a result of changes in governments. We continue to monitor these developments together with their impact on our business. 28

GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE Gas Distribution and Storage consists of our rate-regulated natural gas utility operations, which serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ontario, Quebec, Ohio, North Carolina, Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho as well as Wexpro Company (Wexpro), which develops and produces natural gas reserves on behalf of Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming, and Enbridge Gas Idaho. Our distribution systems, which are supported by storage and compression assets, carry natural gas from the point of local supply to customers across North America. 29

Page 30
There are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which our franchises are directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage. The number of customers, and approximate combined length of pipelines for each of our major distribution and transmission systems as at December 31, 2024 are as follows: As at December 31, 2024 Number of Customers (in millions) Combined Length Enbridge Gas Ontario 3.9 156,000 km (96,934 miles) Enbridge Gas Ohio 1.2 35,406 km (22,000 miles) Enbridge Gas Utah, Wyoming and Idaho 1.2 33,796 km (21,000 miles) Enbridge Gas North Carolina 0.7 20,921 km (13,000 miles) Our storage system principally consists of our assets at Dawn Hub and the Tecumseh Gas Storage facility. Distribution The principal source of revenue for Gas Distribution and Storage arises from the distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis, without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract. The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts. Under a firm contract, we are obligated to deliver natural gas to the customer up to a maximum daily volume. The service provided under an interruptible contract is similar to that of a firm contract, except that it allows for service interruption at our option primarily to meet seasonal or peak demands. The respective regulator for each province or state approves rates for both contract and general services. Customers have a choice with respect to natural gas supply. Customers may purchase and deliver their own natural gas to points upstream of the distribution system or directly into our distribution systems, or, alternatively, they may choose a system supply option, whereby customers purchase natural gas from our supply portfolio. A significant portion of our customers in Ohio participate in the Energy Choice program, under which residential customers are encouraged to purchase gas directly from retail suppliers or through a community aggregation program and have it delivered by us. Customers in our other franchise areas predominantly purchase gas from our diversified natural gas supply portfolio, which we maintain by acquiring supplies on a delivered basis, as well as acquiring supply from multiple supply basins across North America. Certain of our US Gas Utilities have a revenue decoupling mechanism whereby non-gas revenues are decoupled from the temperature-adjusted usage per customer, which allows for the collection of an allowed monthly revenue per customer and to promote energy conservation. Transportation Our gas utility franchises also offer transportation services to move gas through the areas we operate in to key markets throughout North America. Enbridge Gas Ontario contracts for firm transportation service, primarily with TransCanada Pipelines Limited, Vector and NEXUS, to meet its annual natural gas supply requirements. The transportation service contracts are not directly linked with any particular source of natural gas supply. Separating transportation contracts from natural gas supply provides flexibility in obtaining its own natural gas supply and accommodating the requests of its direct purchase customers for assignment of pipeline capacity. In addition to contracting for transportation service, Enbridge Gas Ontario offers firm and interruptible transportation services on its own Dawn-Parkway pipeline system. Enbridge Gas Ontario’s transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at the Tecumseh Gas Storage facility and Dawn Hub (collectively, Dawn) to major Canadian and US markets, and forms an important link in moving natural gas from western Canada and US supply basins to central Canadian and northeastern US markets. 30

Page 31
As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario has continued to grow, there has been increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern US. A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas Ontario’s transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges. Enbridge Gas Ohio system expansion projects over the last decade have provided the opportunity to offer transportation services as an attractive outlet for shale production, by virtue of its proximity to the Utica and Marcellus shale basins while enhancing on-system operational flexibility. Storage Our gas distribution business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits us to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off-peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice helps to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing our overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to our franchise areas. The storage facility at Dawn is located in southwestern Ontario and has a total working capacity of approximately 284 bcf in 33 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Dawn is the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America. Approximately 180 bcf of the total working capacity is available to Enbridge Gas Ontario for utility operations. There is approximately 60 bcf of underground storage in Ohio that provides additional flexibility for system reliability and managing the cost of supply for customers. Dawn offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canadian and US supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeast US. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas Ontario’s storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges. COMPETITION Our gas distribution systems are regulated by the OEB, the Québec Régie de l’énergie, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (Ohio Commission), the North Carolina Utilities Commission (North Carolina Commission), the Utah Public Service Commission (Utah Commission), the Wyoming Public Service Commission (Wyoming Commission), and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (Idaho Commission). Our gas distribution systems are not generally subject to third-party distribution competition within their franchise areas. Our gas distribution business competes with other forms of energy available to customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation, including the federal carbon pricing laws in Canada, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, and other factors. SUPPLY AND DEMAND We anticipate that demand for natural gas in North America will stabilize over the long term with potential growth in peak day demands and from the data center build-out; however, there are risks to the natural gas market that may challenge its growth prospects. 31

Page 32
Net-zero carbon policies, evolving customer preferences for lower-carbon fuels and more efficient technologies, combined with increasing opposition to natural gas development in certain parts of North America, may reduce the markets’ ability to efficiently deploy capital to connect supply and demand. We monitor these factors closely in order to align our business strategy with shifts in customer preferences and public policy requirements. Enbridge continues to focus on promoting conservation and energy efficiency by undertaking activities focused on reducing natural gas consumption through various demand side management programs offered across all markets and sourcing supply with a smaller carbon footprint. In addition to our existing and proposed RNG programs, we are also continuing our efforts to source other lower-carbon supplies, such as hydrogen. Supply and demand are also impacted by the legislative environments in which our franchises operate. For example, in 2024, Ontario passed Bill 165, the Keeping Energy Costs Down Act which reset the revenue horizon to 40 years for residential and small volume consumers and streamlined the regulatory process for pipelines between $2-$10 million. Ontario further demonstrated its support for gas in its vision paper for integrated energy planning where it confirmed its view that "Gas is a vital component of Ontario's energy mix". House Bill 507 was signed in Ohio officially defining natural gas as a "green energy". Ohio and Utah both passed bills in 2021 (House Bill 201 and House Bill 17, respectively) prohibiting bans on natural gas. The law prohibits municipalities and counties from enacting "an ordinance, a resolution, or a policy that prohibits, or has the effect of prohibiting, the connection or reconnection of an energy utility service." However, it does not block local or county officials from supporting electrification through incentives or restricting gas use in municipal or county buildings. In 2021, House Bill 951 was signed in North Carolina, directing the North Carolina Commission to develop a plan, known as the NC Carbon Plan, for a 70% reduction in carbon emissions in the electricity sector by 2030 that is driving coal-to-gas generation switching. Over the past decade, growth in the North American gas supply landscape, driven mainly by the development of unconventional gas resources in the Montney, Permian, Marcellus and Utica supply basins, has resulted in lower annual commodity prices and narrower seasonal price spreads. Natural gas prices have been impacted by lower weather-related demand and higher North American inventory levels resulting in more stable and lower prices. Unregulated storage values are primarily determined by the difference in value between winter and summer natural gas prices. Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming and Enbridge Gas Idaho have a cost-of-service agreement with Wexpro, which develops and produces natural gas reserves on behalf of the utility. Wexpro's production supplies up to 55% of annual demand for the utility (up to 65% if certain conditions are met and approvals obtained) and provides a physical hedge against commodity price volatility while maintaining the option to purchase from third-party suppliers at market rates through long-term contracts. Wexpro's operations stretch from the northern tip of the Greater Green River Basin in Pinedale, Wyoming, through the Vermillion Basin of Wyoming and Colorado, down to the Uinta Basin of Utah. Wexpro establishes its annual drilling program by forecasting the utility's consumption needs. Operating since December 2022, Magna LNG is a 1.2 bcf LNG facility located in Magna, Utah. The facility provides system reliability for Enbridge Gas Utah's customers in Salt Lake City and the surrounding counties. LNG is produced primarily during the warmer months of the year and then stored to be used when needed for reliability. 32

RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION Renewable Power Generation consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as equity interests in geothermal power and power transmission assets. In North America, assets are primarily located in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Québec, and in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. In Europe, we hold equity interests in operating offshore wind facilities in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, as well as interests in several offshore wind projects under construction and active development in France and the United Kingdom. 33

Page 34
Combined Renewable Power Generation investments represent approximately 3,500 MW of net generation capacity, which primarily consists of approximately: • 1,399 MW generated by North American wind facilities; • 621 MW generated by European offshore wind facilities; • 97 MW expected to be generated by the Calvados Offshore Wind Project in France, which is currently under construction; and • 440 MW generated by North American solar facilities in operation, with an additional 945 MW in projects in pre-construction and under construction. The vast majority of the power produced from these facilities is sold under long-term PPAs. JOINT VENTURES / EQUITY INVESTMENTS Most of our investments in Canadian wind and solar assets and two of our US renewable assets are held within a joint venture in which we manage and operate a 51% interest. One of our US solar projects is held within a separate joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest. We also own interests in European offshore wind facilities through the following joint ventures: • a 24.9% interest in Rampion Offshore Wind, located in the United Kingdom; • a 49.9% interest in Hohe See and Albatros Offshore Wind, located in Germany; • a 25.5% interest in the Saint-Nazaire Offshore Wind Project, located in France; • a 25% interest in the Provence Grand Large Floating Offshore Wind Project, located in France; • a 17.9% interest in the Fécamp Offshore Wind Project, located in France; and • a 21.7% interest in the Calvados Offshore Wind Project, under construction in France. COMPETITION Renewable Power Generation operates in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and supply and demand fundamentals for power in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The majority of our revenue is generated from long-term PPAs (or has been substantially hedged). As such, financial performance is not significantly impacted by fluctuating power prices arising from supply/demand imbalances or the actions of competing facilities during the term of the applicable contracts. However, the renewable energy sector includes large utilities, small independent power producers and private equity investors, which are expected to aggressively compete for new project development opportunities and for the right to supply customers when contracts expire. To grow in an environment of heightened competition, we strategically target regions with commercial constructs consistent with our low risk business model. In addition, we leverage our expertise in developing and constructing large-scale infrastructure projects. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Renewable power generation in North America and Europe is expected to grow significantly over the next 20 years due to growing power demand and the replacement of retiring fossil fuel-based sources of electricity generation. Strong load growth across North America is anticipated, driven by growing data center power demand and other large industrial load, as well as the continued electrification within the residential, transportation and industrial sectors. Furthermore, voluntary GHG emissions reduction targets are becoming increasingly expected by stakeholders, which is driving significant demand from corporate electricity end- users for cleaner electricity and environmental attributes. 34

Page 35
In response to the growing demand outlook, North America requires significant new generation capacity from preferred technologies. Gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including solar and wind (which make up the bulk of our renewable power assets), are generally the preferred sources to meet the increased load and replace coal-fired generation due to their lower-carbon intensities. Governments are also proposing tax incentives to support low-emission and renewable energy generation resource development. As renewable energy takes an increasing share of certain states’ and provinces’ electricity grids, governments are also proposing tax incentives for natural gas and battery development to help firm the variable generation on the grid. Falling capital and operating costs of wind and solar, combined with their improving capacity factors, are expected to continue the ongoing trend of making renewable energy more competitive and support investment over the long-term, regardless of available government incentives. Generation from wind and solar sources is expected to more than triple over the next two decades in North America. Aside from the construction of new wind and solar facilities, other growth opportunities include repowering projects to increase output from and extend the project-life of our existing facilities. In Europe, the renewable energy outlook is robust. Demand for electricity is expected to gradually increase over the next two decades, driven by electrification of transportation and buildings, and the desire to reduce reliance on gas sourced from Russia. Energy efficiency gains are expected to temper, but not eliminate, demand growth. Renewable power is expected to play a significant role in Europe’s ability to meet its aggressive lower-carbon and renewable energy targets. We, through our European joint ventures, continue to invest in offshore wind projects in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and to explore opportunities to meet the growing demand. ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER Eliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs that are not allocated to business segments, the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements and the activities of our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. The principal activity of our captive insurance subsidiaries is providing insurance and reinsurance coverage for certain insurable property and casualty risk exposures of our operating subsidiaries and certain equity investments. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and corporate investments, and natural gas and power marketing and logistical services to North American refiners, producers, and other customers. REGULATION GOVERNMENT REGULATION Pipeline Regulation Our Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission assets are subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments and applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. In the US, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an agency within the US Department of Transportation (DOT). These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines and to operate them within permissible design limits such as pressures. 35

Page 36
PHMSA continues to review existing regulations and establish new regulations to support safety and environmental standards that are designed to improve operations integrity management processes and reduce methane emissions. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failure or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows, financial condition and competitive advantage. Our ability to establish transportation and storage rates on our US interstate natural gas facilities is subject to regulation by the FERC, whose rulings and policies could have an adverse impact on the ability to recover the full cost of operating these pipeline and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return. Regulatory or administrative actions by the FERC such as rate proceedings, applications to certify construction of new facilities, and depreciation and amortization policies, can affect our business, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues and increasing our costs of doing business. In Canada, our pipelines are subject to safety regulations administered by the CER or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. As in the US, laws and regulations addressing enhanced pipeline safety in Canada have been enacted over the past few years and are continuously being monitored. These changes demonstrate an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas, such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. The CER has authority to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases. A key component of pipeline safety and reliability is the approach to integrity management that uses reliability targets and safety case assessments. A long history of extensive inline inspection has provided detailed knowledge of the assets in our pipeline systems. Our pipelines are assessed and maintained in a proactive manner in order to meet reliability targets. Furthermore, the integrity management program has an independent step to check the results of integrity assessments to validate the effectiveness of the program so that the operational risk remains as low as reasonably practicable throughout the integrity inspection and assessment cycle. As inspection technology, pipeline materials and construction practices improve with time, and new data on threats and pipeline condition are gathered, our methods of maintaining fitness for service evolves, with a strong focus on continuous improvement. Similar to the US regulatory landscape for integrity management, a significant release could likely lead the CER to impose pressure restrictions which may have an adverse effect on our operations, capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows, financial condition and competitive advantage. Our pipelines also face economic regulatory risk. Broadly defined, economic regulatory risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies reject or revise proposed commercial arrangements, applications or policies, upon which future and current operations are dependent. Our pipelines are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the CER and the FERC, with respect to tariffs and tolls. The rejection or revision of applications for approval of new tariff structures or proposed commercial arrangements and changes in interpretation of existing regulations by courts or regulators could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. 36

Crude Oil Marketing Business The Crude Oil Marketing business is regulated by government authorities in the areas of commodity trading, import and export compliance and the transportation of commodities. Non-compliance with governing rules and regulations could result in fines, penalties and operating restrictions. These consequences would have an adverse effect on operations, earnings, cash flows, financial condition and competitive advantage. Mitigation of these potential risks is managed by a regulatory compliance program. In the US, commodity marketing is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the FERC, the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission, the various commodity exchanges, the US Department of Justice and state regulators. In Canada, provincial and other territorial securities regulators similarly regulate commodity marketing within Canada. These various regulators enforce, among other things, the prohibition of market manipulation, fraud and disruptive trading. The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids by railcar or truck is regulated by the US DOT, Transport Canada and provincial regulation. Each jurisdiction requires compliance with security, safety, emergency management, and environmental laws and regulations related to ground transportation of commodities. Risks associated with transportation of crude or natural gas liquids include unplanned releases, which may require remediation of the affected area. The Crude Oil Marketing business engages third parties, such as Emergency Response Assistance Canada, the Chemical Transportation Emergency Center and the Canadian Transport Emergency Center to assist in such remediation. Gas Distribution and Storage - Canada Enbridge Gas Ontario's operations are regulated by the OEB and Enbridge Gaz Quebec's operations are regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or amounts that would have been recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in the absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded. In October 2022, Enbridge Gas Ontario filed its application with the OEB to establish a 2024 through 2028 Incentive Regulation (IR) rate setting framework. The application initially sought approval in two phases to establish 2024 base rates (Phase 1) on a cost-of-service basis and to establish a price cap rate setting mechanism (Phase 2) to be used for the remainder of the IR term (2025-2028). A third phase (Phase 3) has been established with the OEB as part of the Phase 1 Partial Settlement Proposal (Phase 1 Settlement). Phase 3 will address cost allocation and the harmonization of rates and rate classes between legacy rate zones, and is anticipated to be completed in 2025. In August 2023, the OEB approved the Phase 1 Settlement and in December 2023, the OEB issued its Decision and Order on the remaining unsettled items in Phase 1 (Phase 1 Decision). These decisions include the following findings or orders: • energy transition risk requires us to carry out a risk assessment to consider further risk mitigation measures in three areas: system access and expansion capital spending, system renewal capital spending and depreciation policy; • all new small volume customers wishing to connect to natural gas are to pay their full connection costs as an upfront charge (the revenue horizon was set to zero years), rather than through rates over time effective January 2025; • approval of a harmonized depreciation methodology that reduced the amount of depreciation sought and adjusted asset lives including extensions of service life for certain asset classes; • the removal of $84 million of undepreciated integration capital costs from 2024 rate base; and • an increase in equity thickness from 36% to 38% effective 2024. 37

Page 38
Enbridge Gas Ontario filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ontario Divisional Court in January 2024 regarding various aspects of the Phase 1 Decision and subsequently filed an amended Notice of Appeal in December 2024 (Amended Appeal). The Amended Appeal focused on two aspects of the Phase 1 Decision: asset class average useful lives for depreciation purposes, and equity thickness. In January 2024, Enbridge Gas Ontario filed a Notice of Motion with the OEB requesting the OEB to review and vary the Phase 1 Decision which was subsequently amended in May 2024 (Amended Motion). The Amended Motion focused on two aspects of the Phase 1 Decision: asset class average useful lives for depreciation purposes, and the recoverability of integration capital. In October 2024, the OEB issued a decision on the Amended Motion and determined that only the issue of integration capital met the threshold to warrant a review. We are currently awaiting an OEB decision on the issue of integration capital. In May 2024, Bill 165, the Keeping Energy Costs Down Act, received royal assent, giving the Government of Ontario time-limited authority to set the revenue horizon for small volume customers, effectively reversing that aspect of the OEB's Phase 1 Decision. Regulations are now in place setting the revenue horizon for new customer connections to 40 years. In November 2024, the OEB issued its Decision approving the Phase 2 Partial Settlement Proposal (Phase 2 Settlement). The Phase 2 Settlement establishes a price cap IR rate setting mechanism to be used for establishing rates for 2025 – 2028. The price cap mechanism will establish new rates each year through an annual base rate adjustment to migrate an incremental $50 million in capitalized overheads to operating and maintenance costs, annual base rate escalation at inflation less a 0.28% productivity factor, annual updates for certain costs to be passed through to customers, and where applicable, it will provide for the recovery of material unexpected events and discrete incremental capital investments beyond those that can be funded through base rates. The price cap mechanism includes the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires Enbridge Gas Ontario to share equally with customers any earnings in excess of 100 basis points over the allowed return on equity (ROE), and 90% of any earnings in excess of 300 basis points over the allowed ROE. Issues not addressed as part of the Phase 2 Settlement proceeded to hearing in December 2024 and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2025. Gas Distribution and Storage - US Our US utilities operations are regulated by the Ohio Commission, the Utah Commission, the Wyoming Commission, the Idaho Commission, and the North Carolina Commission, as well as PHMSA and the US DOT. Gas Regulation in Ohio Enbridge Gas Ohio is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Ohio Commission. When necessary, Enbridge Gas Ohio seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. A straight-fixed-variable rate design, in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through a monthly charge rather than a volumetric charge, is utilized to establish rates for a majority of Enbridge Gas Ohio’s customers, pursuant to a 2008 rate case settlement. The Ohio Commission has also approved several stand-alone cost recovery mechanisms to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure, information technology and integrity or compliance-related projects between general base rate cases. 38

Page 39
In October 2023, Enbridge Gas Ohio filed its base rate case and schedules with the Ohio Commission. Enbridge Gas Ohio proposed a non-fuel, base rate annual revenue increase of $212 million, projected to be effective January 2025. The base rate increase was proposed to recover the significant investment in distribution infrastructure for the benefit of Ohio customers. The proposed rates would have provided for an ROE of 10.40% compared to the currently authorized ROE of 10.38%. In addition, Enbridge Gas Ohio requested approval for an alternative rate plan for the continuation and modification of certain programs, including Pipeline Infrastructure Replacement (PIR) and Capital Expenditure Program (CEP). On December 18, 2024, Enbridge Gas Ohio filed a Notice of Intent to Modify Filed Positions. The Notice of Intent indicated a willingness to accept a reduced annual revenue requirement increase (from $212 million to $60 million) and, if the reduced position were adopted, to forgo filing a new base rate case until October 31, 2027. The hearing began on January 13, 2025, and remains underway. In 2008, PIR was introduced, aimed at replacing approximately 25% of its pipeline system. The Ohio Commission has approved Enbridge Gas Ohio’s PIR program for capital investments through 2026 with 3% increases of annual capital expenditures per year. In 2011, CEP was introduced, which enables Enbridge Gas Ohio to defer depreciation expense, property tax expense and carrying costs at the debt rate of 6.5% on capital investments not covered by its PIR program to expand, upgrade or replace its infrastructure and information technology systems, as well as investments necessary to comply with the Ohio Commission or other government regulation. Gas Regulation in Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming, and Enbridge Gas Idaho are subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Utah Commission, the Wyoming Commission, and the Idaho Commission, respectively. The Idaho Commission has contracted with the Utah Commission for rate oversight of Enbridge Gas Idaho’s operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho. When necessary, Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming and Enbridge Gas Idaho seek general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. Base rates are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. The volumetric charges for the residential and small commercial customers in Utah and Wyoming are subject to revenue decoupling and adjusted for changes in usage per customer. Gas Regulation in North Carolina Enbridge Gas North Carolina is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the North Carolina Commission. When necessary, Enbridge Gas North Carolina seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. Base rates for Enbridge Gas North Carolina are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. The volumetric charges for the residential and commercial customers are subject to revenue decoupling and adjusted for changes in usage per customer. The North Carolina Commission has approved a standalone cost recovery mechanism to recover specified capital costs and a return for pipeline integrity management infrastructure projects between general base rate cases. Renewable Power Generation Renewable Power Generation is subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments and applicable regulatory authorities. Breaches of these rules and regulations could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. 39

Page 40
The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) is an international regulatory authority responsible for establishing and enforcing reliability standards to reduce risks to the reliability and security of the grid in Canada, the US, and Mexico. It is subject to oversight from the FERC in the US and provincial governments in Canada. The FERC has authority over many markets in the US and is tasked with ensuring safe, reliable, and secure interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. This includes establishing reliability standards, market rates, and determining certain pricing aspects of transmission development and access, among others. NERC and FERC standards and pricing decisions are also updated from time to time and could impact our operations, capital expenditures, earnings, and cash flows, though some of these impacts could be positive for our business. At the US federal level, our Renewable Power Generation assets are subject to legislation overseen by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which is aimed at reducing the impact of development and human activity on wildlife, along with other federal environmental permitting legislation. These federal environmental laws are subject to change from time to time, which could require Enbridge to obtain new permits, update practices, or amend operations and operating expenditures. In Canada, the Federal Government does not generally regulate the electricity sector, though it has imposed a federal carbon price on other sectors via its output-based pricing system and has proposed a Clean Electricity Regulation (CE Regulation) that would require Canada’s electricity grid to reach net-zero by 2050 with initial limitations beginning in 2035. The CE Regulation came into effect in December 2024. Policy changes may also impact our existing assets and the opportunity for new developments. For example, the US enacted the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, establishing long-term transferable production and investment tax credits for renewable power generation, battery storage projects and for related manufacturing supply chains. Similarly, Canada has passed legislation enabling the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and published a draft Clean Electricity ITC legislation anticipated to be enacted in mid-2025 focusing on non-taxable entities. Both of these credits would provide refundable ITCs for renewable power generation and battery storage projects. Changes to these programs, including as a result of a change in administration, could impact development plans. Renewable Power Generation is also subject to provincial and state regulations governing the energy resource mix on the grid, emissions levels of the electricity grid, and market regulations related to emergency operations, extreme weather preparedness, and market participation, among others. These regulations may change from time to time, which could impact Enbridge’s operations and increase the costs of participating in regional electricity markets. In 2023, the Texas legislature proposed firming requirements that would require new wind and solar projects to be paired with batteries or other dispatchable power supply either on or offsite to enable more firm supply. These requirements were not enacted; however, they remain an important consideration going forward and heading into the 2025 legislative session. Other state and provincial governments are also prioritizing reliability and more dispatchable generation characteristics in their markets. Our Renewable Power Generation assets in France and Germany each have federal policies in place and are subject to directives and regulations established and enforced by the European Union (EU). These include the Renewable Energy Directive, the European Green Deal, and ongoing work on financing mechanisms and transmission directives and programs. The EU is also responsible for establishing environmental protection rules and permitting standards. During 2022, member states of the EU introduced extraordinary and temporary measures to address high energy prices including caps and demand reduction goals. As the minimum PPA prices in Germany and France are still honored, there are no negative implications to our PPA prices. The federal policies and regulations in place are subject to change from time to time, which could impact our operations and related expenditures; however, the EU’s general direction is to facilitate increased renewable power integration to its grid. 40

Page 41
The United Kingdom (UK) government is responsible for establishing renewable energy and carbon pricing policies for the entire UK, as well as long-term electricity sector planning and procurement mechanisms and structure for auctions that are administered at the national level, e.g., England, Scotland, within the UK. Each country within the UK is also responsible for establishing its own environmental and permitting regulations. This process is still ongoing following Brexit and, in some cases, continues to result in more volatile merchant power prices; however, expanded interconnectors to Europe and policies aimed at increasing domestic renewable capacity are in progress. Governments have introduced temporary price controls and other measures, beginning on January 1, 2023, to address the significant increase in energy prices. The impact of merchant exposure on our Renewable Power Generation assets in the UK is limited by fixed revenue payments backed by the UK government. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION Pipeline Regulation Our Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission assets are subject to numerous federal, state and provincial environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, water discharge and waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits and other approvals. In particular, in the US, compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some equipment in states in which we operate are affected by the Good Neighbor Rule establishing new emission limits for nitrogen oxides. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs may significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels. In the US, climate change action is evolving at federal, state and regional levels. On March 8, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a final rule to minimize methane emissions for new and existing crude oil and natural gas facilities. Pursuant to federal regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions through the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program at facilities that exceed the reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. This program was revised to include additional sources and new measurement and calculations methodologies for the oil and gas sector on May 14, 2024, and effective for reporting year 2025. These changes were designed to comply with the Inflation Reduction Act ’s requirement to revise the program to utilize more empirical data. This data is used to calculate a fee under the Methane Emissions Reduction Program through the Methane Waste Emission Charge that was finalized and published on November 18, 2024. In addition, several states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. Based on proposed changes to measure, report and mitigate GHG emissions the expectation is that there will be a significant increase in costs to maintain and report compliance for businesses in our industry. 41

Page 42
Canada has adopted a pan-Canadian approach to pricing carbon emissions to incent GHG emission reductions across all sectors of the economy. This approach was adopted in 2016 and entails both a consumer price on carbon, and an intensity-based system for industry which addresses competitiveness and carbon leakage. Provinces and territories may implement their own system of carbon pricing provided it meets the federal benchmark (and if they fail to do so the federal system will be imposed on them). In March 2022, Canada published its 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) which builds on the Pan- Canadian Framework, and Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act , and details the roadmap for Canada to meet its domestic climate target of a 40-45% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and attaining net-zero emissions by 2050. The ERP details the complementary policies and programs that Canada will enact to enable it to meet its domestic climate goal. Effective April 1, 2024, the federal carbon price was increased to $65 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). This will increase by $15 per tonne each year and rise to $170 per tCO2e in 2030. Two pending regulations in Canada that are expected to impact our operations include the amended federal methane regulations and the proposed volatile organic compounds (VOC) regulations. The amended methane regulations are part of Canada's broader effort to achieve at least a 75% reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 2030, relative to 2012 levels. These regulations would impact Enbridge’s Gas Transmission assets to build upon the current regulations to further reduce methane emissions by limiting venting and increasing leak detection. The proposed VOC regulations, if adopted, would impact Enbridge’s Liquids Pipelines assets, specifically petroleum liquid storage tanks and loading operations, by requiring emission control equipment on in-scope storage tanks and loading racks. Both regulations are expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025; we continue to monitor these developments, including any potential impacts to our business. Gas Distribution and Storage Our Gas Distribution and Storage operations, facilities and workers are subject to municipal, provincial, state and federal legislation which regulates the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. Environmental legislation primarily includes regulation of spills and emissions to air, land and water; hazardous waste management; the assessment and management of excess soil and contaminated sites; protection of environmentally sensitive areas, and species at risk and their habitats; and the reporting and reduction of GHG emissions. Gas distribution system operation, as with any industrial operation, has the potential risk of abnormal or emergency conditions, or other unplanned events that could result in releases or emissions exceeding permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, adverse impacts to the environment, property damage and/or regulatory infractions including orders and fines. We could also incur future liability for soil and groundwater contamination associated with past and present site activities. In addition to gas distribution, we also operate gas storage facilities in Ontario and Ohio, and our Wexpro business develops and produces natural gas reserves. Environmental risk associated with these facilities has the potential for unplanned releases, which could require remediation of the affected area. There would also be potential for fines and orders under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by any affected landowners. The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain environmental approvals and permits from regulators to operate. As a result, these assets and facilities are subject to periodic inspections and/ or audits. Reports are submitted to our regulators as required to demonstrate compliance with environmental requirements. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental mitigation. 42

As environmental regulations continue to evolve and become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals continues to increase. A recent example includes the implementation of the new excess soil management requirements (Ontario Regulation 406/19) which has resulted in an increase in soil management costs and effort. As in previous years, in 2024 we reported operational GHG emissions, including emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, venting and fugitive sources to Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. In accordance with the provincial GHG regulations, stationary combustion and flaring emissions related to storage and transmission operations were verified in detail by a third-party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found. Under the federal government's Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act , a carbon charge took effect on April 1, 2019 at a rate of 3.91 cents/cubic meter (m3) of natural gas and is applicable to the majority of customers. Enbridge Gas Ontario is registered as a natural gas distributor with the Canada Revenue Agency and remits the federal carbon charge on a monthly basis. The charge increases annually on April 1 of each year, and rose to 15.25 cents/m3 in 2024. The federal carbon price increases by $15 per tCO2e each year, and is scheduled to rise to $170 per tCO2e in 2030, which would equate to a federal carbon charge of 32.40 cents/m3 in 2030. Effective January 1, 2022, Enbridge Gas Ontario transitioned from the federal output-based pricing system to the Ontario Emissions Performance Standards (EPS). Enbridge Gas Ontario is registered with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) as a covered facility under the EPS and has an annual compliance obligation for its facility-related stationary combustion and flaring emissions associated with its transmission and storage operations. Enbridge Gas Ontario must remit payment annually on the portion of emissions that exceed its total annual emissions limit. In June 2024, the MECP launched the Emissions Performance Program (EPP), a program funded by compliance payments collected from EPS. The EPP allows EPS facilities to apply for funding to support projects that reduce eligible GHG emissions at the eligible EPS facility. Enbridge Gas Ontario has identified projects that are potentially eligible for EPP funding and is working with the MECP to submit EPP applications. Enbridge Gas Ontario applies to the OEB annually through a Federal Carbon Pricing Program application for approval of just and reasonable rates effective April 1 each year to recover the costs associated with the Federal Carbon Charge and EPS Regulation as a pass-through to customers. Our US gas distribution operations are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the management, storage, treatment, reuse, and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 , Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act , the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 , and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 . Wexpro's operations and construction activities, related to oil and gas production and gas storage wells, generate waste. Completion water is disposed of at commercial disposal facilities, while produced water is either hauled for disposal, evaporated, or injected into company and third party-owned underground injection wells. Wells drilled in tight-gas-sand and shale reservoirs require hydraulic-fracture stimulation to achieve economic production rates and recoverable reserves. The majority of Wexpro's current and future production and reserve potential comes from reservoirs that need hydraulic-fracture stimulation to be commercially viable. Currently, all well construction activities, including hydraulic-fracture stimulation and the management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids, are regulated by federal and state agencies that review and approve all aspects of gas and oil well design and operation. 43

Page 44
In 2025, we will report 2024 operational GHG emissions, including emissions from combustion, venting, and fugitive sources, for the first time for our newly acquired US Gas Utilities to the Environmental Protection Agency under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Renewable Power Generation Our Renewable Power Generation assets are subject to a combination of federal, state, provincial and local government agencies. These regulations and laws associated with these agencies affect the development and operations of our renewable power assets and generally require us to assess the environmental landscape and obtain and comply with a variety of environmental licenses, permits and other approvals. In Canada, our Renewable Power Generation assets are subject to the federal Species at Risk Act and provincial regulations that are aimed at mitigating the effects of development and human activity on wildlife. At the US federal level, our assets are subject to legislation overseen by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which is similarly aimed at reducing the impact of development and human activity on wildlife, along with other federal environmental permitting legislation. These environmental laws (federal, state and provincial) are subject to change from time to time which could require Enbridge to obtain new permits, update practices, or amend operations and operating expenditures. The regulatory landscape continues to evolve to address new developments within this relatively new industry. In the summer of 2023, the Federal Government of Canada introduced its draft CE Regulation that are intended to achieve a net-zero electricity grid by 2050 with initial limitations beginning in 2035. The Federal Government of Canada released finalized regulations on December 17, 2024 setting limits on GHG emissions from almost all electricity generation units that use fossil fuels. The finalized regulations also include a compliance credit system, and opportunities for credit trading and pooling within federal and provincial frameworks, intended to provide flexibility for operators to meet the new standards. Similarly, in April 2024, the US EPA finalized regulations for coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants designed to reduce emissions 75 percent below 2005 levels by 2035. These regulations require covered facilities to reduce carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to a 90 percent carbon capture and sequestration rate by 2032. Facilities with less than 40 percent capacity rates would be required to adhere to less stringent requirements, including enhanced energy efficiency. These government policies are rapidly evolving, including as a result of changes in governments. We continue to monitor these developments, together with their impact on our business. Enbridge’s Renewable Power Generation resources are substantially non-emitting. HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES WORKFORCE SIZE AND COMPOSITION As at December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,500 regular employees, including approximately 2,600 unionized employees across our North American operations. This total includes approximately 3,500 employees who joined in 2024 following the close of the Acquisitions of the US Gas Utilities. Overall headcount rises to just over 16,000 if temporary employees and contractors are included. We have a strong preference for direct employment relationships but where we have collectively bargained-for employees, we have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage. 44

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, financial results, market price or value of our securities. This list is not exhaustive, and we place no priority or likelihood based on order of presentation or grouping under sub-captions. RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change risks could adversely affect our reputation, strategic plan, business, operations and financial results, and these effects could be material. Climate change is a systemic risk that presents both physical and transition risks to our organization. A summary of these risks is outlined below. Given the interconnected nature of climate change-related impacts, we also discuss these risks within the context of other risks impacting Enbridge throughout Item 1A. Risk Factors . Climate change and its associated impacts may also increase our exposure to, and magnitude of, other risks identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors . Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, reputation, access to and cost of capital or insurance, business plans and strategy may all be materially adversely impacted as a result of climate change and its associated impacts. PHYSICAL RISKS Climate-related physical risks, resulting from changing and more extreme weather, can damage our assets and affect the safety and reliability of our operations. Climate-related physical risks may be acute or chronic. Acute physical risks are those that are event-driven, including increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, fires, hurricanes, cyclones, tornados, tropical storms, ice storms, and extreme temperatures. Chronic physical risks are longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as long-term changes in precipitation patterns, or sustained higher temperatures, which may cause sea level rises or chronic heat waves. Our assets and operations are exposed to potential damage or other negative impacts from these kinds of events, which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in reduced revenue from business disruption or reduced capacity and may also lead to increased costs due to repairs and required adaptation measures. We have experienced operational interruptions and damage to our assets from such weather events in the past, and we expect to continue to experience climate-related physical risks in the future, potentially with increasing frequency or severity. Such events may also result in personal injury, loss of life. TRANSITION RISKS The transition to a lower-carbon economy involves policy, legal, technology and market changes which may, in turn, increase our cost of operations and influence stakeholder sentiment and decisions about Enbridge, including potentially reducing the demand for some of our services, which could result in a decrease in profitability or reduction in the value of our assets. Transition risks include the following categories: • Policy and legal risks Policy and legal risks may result from evolving government policy, legislation, regulations and regulatory decisions focused on climate change, as well as changing political and public opinion, stakeholder opposition, legal challenges, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Foreign and domestic governments and regulators continue to evaluate and implement policy, legislation, regulations and decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of and adapting to climate change, including measures to reduce GHG emissions and shift to lower-carbon sources of energy. Such policies, laws and regulations vary at the federal, state, provincial and municipal levels in which Enbridge operates and are continually evolving. Rules, standards, and methodologies for setting climate-related goals and for measuring and reporting climate-related information are still developing. At the same time, we have seen the rise of anti-ESG activism, creating competing stakeholder priorities and increasing 48

Page 49
uncertainty. As a result, our climate-related goals and disclosures are based on assumptions that are subject to change. Collectively, these measures have resulted and are expected to continue to result in increased costs to us. Enbridge adheres to a number of carbon-pricing mechanisms, including explicit carbon prices (i.e., in BC) and implicit carbon prices (i.e., Canadian federal output-based pricing system). In Canada, the federal government has proposed new Clean Electricity Regulations and is considering options to cap and cut GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector, which may impact our business. Such evolving policy, legislation and regulation could impact commodity demand, and the overall energy mix we deliver and may result in significant expenditures and resources, as well as increased costs for our customers. In recent years, there has also been changing political and public opinion and stakeholder opposition in relation to parts of our business and industry, as well as an increase in climate-related litigation and regulatory action against companies, all of which could impact our reputation, strategy and financial results. • Technology risks Executing our strategic priorities, including participating in the energy transition over time and attaining our GHG emissions reduction goals, depends, in part, on technological improvements and innovation. This includes the development and use of emerging technologies, such as renewable power and other lower-carbon energy infrastructure. Such technological developments could require significant capital expenditures and resources and may, impact our competitiveness. GHG emissions reduction technology may not materialize as expected, which could make it more difficult to reduce emissions and meet our ESG goals. • Market risks Concerns about climate change, increased demand for lower-carbon forms of energy and new energy technologies, changing customer behavior, and reduced energy consumption could impact the demand for our services or our securities. In recent years, certain investors, lenders and insurers have taken or are contemplating actions to decrease the carbon intensity of their portfolios or reduce or cease support for the fossil fuel industry. Such measures could result in increased costs to manage these risks and could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital, as well as demand for, or value of, our securities or our services. Uncertainty in market signals, such as abrupt and unexpected shifts in energy costs and demands, including due to climate change concerns, could impact revenue through reduced throughput volumes on our pipeline transportation systems. • Reputational risks Companies across all sectors and industries are facing changing expectations and increased scrutiny from stakeholders related to their approach to climate change and GHG emissions. Companies in the energy industry are experiencing stakeholder opposition to their operations and infrastructure projects. Enbridge’s ESG goals, sustainability-related activities, commitments, and plans, including climate-related information and data, are based on various assumptions, estimates, judgments, risks, and uncertainties. Achieving these ESG goals and commitments will require collective efforts and actions from a wide range of stakeholders, much of which is beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that the impact of these efforts and actions will be realized. Our ESG goals and pathways for reducing operational emissions will continue to evolve and may need to be restated, modified, or recalibrated as data improves, standards, methodologies, metrics, and measurements mature, and as legislation, regulations, policies, and stakeholder sentiment evolve. If we experience challenges, or perceived challenges in achieving our climate-related goals, are not able to meet future climate- related, emissions, or other regulatory or reporting requirements, or are not able to meet or manage stakeholder expectations regarding climate change or disclosure of climate-change information (including potential allegations of greenwashing), it could negatively impact our reputation or investor sentiment and could expose us to government enforcement actions or litigation, which may, in turn, impact our business, operations or financial results. 49

Page 50
RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS Operation of complex energy infrastructure involves many hazards and risks that may adversely affect our business, financial results, the environment, relationships with stakeholders, and our reputation. These operational risks include adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment, processes or human error, and lower than expected levels of operating capacity and efficiency. These operational risks could be catastrophic in nature. Operational risk is also intensified by exposure to severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including those related to climate change, which may affect the safety and reliability of our operations, including, but not limited to heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, fires, hurricanes, cyclones, tornados, tropical storms, ice storms, and extreme temperatures, and chronic physical risks, such as long- term changes in precipitation patterns, or sustained higher temperatures. Our assets and operations are exposed to potential damage or other negative impacts from these operational risks, which could result in reduced revenue from business disruption or reduced capacity and may also lead to increased costs due to repairs and required adaptation measures. Such events have led to, and could in the future lead to, rupture or release of product from our pipeline systems and facilities, resulting in damage to property and the environment, personal injury or loss of life. Such an incident has in the past, and could in the future, result in substantial losses for which insurance may not be sufficient or available and for which we may bear part or all of the cost, thereby negatively impacting earnings. Such incidents could also have lasting reputational impacts and could impair our relationships with various stakeholders. For pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential communities, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering locations, the level of damage resulting from these events could be greater. We have experienced such events in the past and expect to continue to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to operational risks and events. We expect to continue to experience climate- related physical risks, potentially with increasing frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that we will not experience catastrophic or other events in the future. In addition, we have in the past, and could in the future, be subject to litigation and significant fines and penalties from regulators in connection with any such events. A service interruption could have a significant impact on our operations, and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders and our reputation. A service interruption due to a major power disruption, curtailment of commodity supply, operational incident, security incident (cyber or physical), availability of gas supply or distribution, or other reasons, could have a significant impact on our operations and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders, our reputation or the safety of our end-use customers. Service interruptions that impact our crude oil and natural gas transportation services can negatively impact shippers’ operations and earnings as they are dependent on our services to move their product to market or fulfill their own contractual arrangements, and this has in the past led to and may again lead to claims against us. We have experienced, and may again experience, service interruptions, restrictions or other operational constraints, including in connection with the kinds of operational incidents referred to in the previous risk factor. 50

Page 51
Our operations involve safety risks to the public and to our workers and contractors. Enbridge assets may change over time and operate over a broad geographic area. These assets include liquids pipelines, gas transmission, and gas distribution systems which are operated near populated areas. A major incident involving these assets has resulted in and may again result in injury or loss of life to members of the public. In addition, given the natural hazards inherent in our operations, our workers and contractors are subject to personal safety risks. A public safety incident or an injury or loss of life to our workers or contractors, which we have experienced in the past and, despite the precautions we take, may experience in the future, could result in reputational damage to us, legal claims, material repair costs or increased operating and insurance costs. Cyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents pose threats to our technology systems and could materially adversely affect our business, operations, reputation or financial results. Our business is dependent upon information systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants, pipelines and other assets, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. With the evolution of AI, our business has incorporated AI into our operations in order to gain efficiencies and productivity in our day-to-day operations, which has the potential to increase technology and cybersecurity risks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information is critical to our operations. Cybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication of cyber attacks and financially-motivated cybercrime, as well as international and domestic political factors, including geopolitical tensions, armed hostilities, war, civil unrest, sabotage, terrorism and state-sponsored or other cyber espionage. Human error or malfeasance can also contribute to a cyber incident, and cyber attacks can be internal as well as external and occur at any point in our supply chain. Because of the critical nature of our infrastructure and our use of information systems and other digital technologies to control our assets, we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents, such as ransomware, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, hacking, malicious attacks, software vulnerabilities, employee errors and/or malfeasance, or other attacks, security or data breaches or other cybersecurity incidents. Cyber threat actors have attacked and continue to threaten to attack energy infrastructure, including our assets, and various government agencies have increasingly stressed that these attacks are targeting critical infrastructure, including pipelines, public utilities, and power generation facilities, and are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. Additionally, these risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. In addition, new cybersecurity legislation, regulations and orders have been recently implemented or proposed, resulting in additional actual and anticipated regulatory oversight and compliance requirements, which will require significant internal and external resources. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business of potential future legislation, regulations or orders relating to cybersecurity. We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our systems or our company data without authorization, and we expect this trend to continue. Although we devote significant resources and security measures to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect our systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, we and our third-party vendors have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber attacks of varying degrees in the conduct of our business, including denial of service attacks. To date, these prior cyber attacks have not, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. However, we have experienced an increasing number of cybersecurity threats in recent years and there is a risk that any such incidents could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. 51

Page 52
Our technology systems or those of our vendors or other service providers are expected to become the target of further cyber attacks or security breaches which could compromise our data and systems or our access thereto by us, our customers or others, affect our ability to correctly record, process and report transactions, result in the loss of information, or cause operational disruption or incidents. There can be no assurance that our business continuity plans will be completely effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts. Furthermore, we and some of our third-party service providers (who may in turn also use third-party service providers) collect, process or store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personal information of our employees, residential gas distribution customers, land owners and investors, as well as intellectual property or other proprietary business information of ours or our customers or suppliers. In light of the Acquisitions, due to their large residential customer bases, we and some of our third-party services providers will process increasing amounts of personal information. As a result of the foregoing, we could experience loss of revenues, repair, remediation or restoration costs, regulatory action, fines and penalties, litigation, breach of contract or indemnity claims, cyber extortion, ransomware, implementation costs for additional security measures, loss of customers, customer dissatisfaction, reputational harm, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, other adverse consequences, or other costs or financial loss. In light of the Acquisitions, these risks may be heightened, and the consequences magnified. Regardless of the method or form of cyber attack or incident, any or all of the above could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, operations or financial results. In addition, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period without detection. Any investigation of a cyber attack or other security incident may be inherently unpredictable, and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and availability of full and reliable information. During such time, we may not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack or other security incident, and our remediation efforts may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Moreover, recent rulemakings may require us to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident before it has been completely investigated or remediated in full or even in part. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, media reports about a cyber attack or other significant security incident affecting Enbridge, whether accurate or not, or, under certain circumstances, our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, law enforcement, other regulatory agencies or affected individuals following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or otherwise, could negatively impact our operating results and result in other adverse consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, harm to our relationships with customers, partners, suppliers, investors, and other third parties, interruption to our management, remediation or increased protection costs, significant litigation or regulatory action, fines or penalties, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, operations, reputation or financial results. 52

Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war, other civil unrest or activism, or geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Terrorist attacks and threats (which may take the form of cyber attacks, as outlined above), escalation of military activity, armed hostilities, war, sabotage, or civil unrest or activism may have significant effects on general economic conditions and may cause fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity, each of which could adversely affect our business. Future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the US or Canada, or military or trade disruptions may significantly affect our operations and those of our customers. Strategic critical infrastructure targets, such as energy-related assets, are at greater risk of cyber attack and may be at greater risk of other future attacks than other targets in the US and Canada. Enbridge’s infrastructure and projects under construction could be direct targets or indirect casualties of a cyber or physical attack. In addition, increased environmental activism against construction and operation of energy infrastructure could potentially result in work delays, reduced demand for our products and services, new legislation or public policy or increased stringency thereof, or denial or delay of permits and rights-of-way. Enbridge also faces risks related to international relations and geopolitical events. Factors such as political, economic, or social instability, trade disputes, increased tariffs, changes in laws, strict regulations, and shifts in political leadership can lead to higher commodity prices and affect energy availability and costs. Pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks may adversely affect local and global economies and our business, operations or financial results. Disruptions caused by pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial results and forward-looking expectations. Governments' emergency measures to combat the spread could include restrictions on business activity and travel, as well as requirements to isolate or quarantine. The duration and magnitude of such impacts will depend on many factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. COVID-19 and government responses interrupted business activities and supply chains, disrupted travel, and contributed to significant volatility in the financial and commodity markets. Disruptions related to pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors . RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY There are utilization risks with respect to our assets. With respect to our Liquids Pipelines assets, we are partially exposed to throughput risk on the Canadian Mainline, and we are exposed to throughput risk under certain tolling agreements applicable to other Liquids Pipelines assets, such as the Lakehead System. A decrease in volumes transported can directly and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Factors such as changing market fundamentals, capacity bottlenecks, regulatory restrictions, maintenance and operational incidents on our system and upstream or downstream facilities, and increased competition can all impact the utilization of our assets. Market fundamentals, such as commodity prices and price differentials, weather, gasoline prices and consumption, tariffs, alternative and new energy sources and technologies, and global supply disruptions outside of our control can impact both the supply of and demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons transported on our pipelines. With respect to our Gas Transmission assets, gas supply and demand dynamics continue to change due to shifts in regional and global production and consumption. These shifts can lead to fluctuations in commodity prices and price differentials, which could result in our system not being fully utilized in some areas. Other factors affecting system utilization include operational incidents, regulatory restrictions, system maintenance, and increased competition. 53

Page 54
With respect to our Gas Distribution and Storage assets, customers of our gas distribution franchises are billed on both a fixed charge and volumetric basis and our ability to collect the total revenue requirement (the cost of providing service, including a reasonable return to the utility) in certain jurisdictions depends on achieving the forecast distribution volume established in the rate-making process. The probability of realizing such volume is contingent upon four key forecast variables: weather, economic conditions, pricing of competitive energy sources and growth in the number of customers. Weather is a significant driver of delivery volumes, given that a significant portion of our gas distribution customer base uses natural gas for space heating. Our ability to add new customers could be impacted by market conditions affecting housing activity such as interest rates, affordability levels, and energy transition. Sales and transportation service to large volume commercial and industrial customers are more susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. As well, the pricing of competitive energy sources affects volume distributed to these sectors, as some customers have the ability to switch to an alternate fuel. Even in those circumstances where we attain our respective total forecast distribution volume, our gas distribution business may not earn its expected ROE due to other forecast variables, such as fluctuations in the mix between higher- and lower-margin customers. All of our gas distribution businesses remain at risk for the actual versus forecast of large volume contract commercial and industrial volumes. With respect to our Renewable Power Generation assets, earnings from these assets are highly dependent on weather and atmospheric conditions as well as continued operational availability of these energy producing assets. While the expected energy yields for Renewable Power Generation projects are predicted using long-term historical data, wind and solar resources are subject to natural variation from year-to-year and from season-to-season. Any prolonged reduction in wind or solar resources at any of the Renewable Power Generation facilities could lead to decreased earnings and cash flows. Additionally, inefficiencies or interruptions of Renewable Power Generation facilities due to operational disturbances or outages resulting from weather conditions or other factors, could also impact earnings. Our assets vary in age and were constructed over many decades, which causes our inspection, maintenance or repair costs to increase. Our pipelines vary in age and were constructed over many decades. Pipelines are generally long-lived assets, and pipeline construction, including coating techniques have changed over time. Depending on the era of construction and construction techniques, some assets require more frequent inspections, which have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in increased maintenance or repair costs in the future. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Competition may result in a reduction in demand for our services, fewer project opportunities or assumption of risk that results in weaker or more volatile financial performance than expected. Our Liquids Pipelines business faces competition from competing carriers available to ship liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the US and internationally and from proposed pipelines that seek to access basins and markets currently served by our Liquids Pipelines. Competition among existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets. The commodities transported in our pipelines currently, or are increasingly expected to, compete with other emerging alternatives for end- users, including, but not limited to, electricity, electric batteries, biofuels, and hydrogen. Additionally, we face competition from alternative storage facilities. Our natural gas transmission and storage business competes with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The natural gas transported and distributed in our business also competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, and renewable energy. Our Renewable Power Generation business faces competition in the procurement of long-term power purchase agreements and from other fuel sources in the markets in which we operate. Competition in all of our businesses, including competition for new project development opportunities, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 54

Page 55
Completion of our secured projects and maintenance programs are subject to various regulatory, operational and market risks, which may affect our ability to drive long-term growth. Our project execution continues to face challenges with intense scrutiny on regulatory and environmental permit applications, politicized permitting, public opposition including protests, action to repeal permits, and resistance to land access. Continued challenges with global supply chains have created unpredictability in materials cost and availability. Labor shortages and inflationary pressures have increased the costs of engineering and construction services. Governments in Canada and the US have enacted or proposed legislation and policies that have the potential to disrupt global and North American supply chains, which may, in turn, disrupt our project execution. They have also enacted legislation and policies relating to forced labor and child labor in supply chains which require the company to, among other things, report on the steps taken in the previous year to mitigate the risk of forced labor or child labor in our supply chain, and these requirements continue to evolve and may impact our supply chain. Other events that can delay, and have in the past delayed project completion and increased anticipated costs include contractor or supplier non-performance, extreme weather events or geological factors beyond our control. The effects of US and Canadian Government policies on tariffs and trade relations between Canada and the US are uncertain and could adversely impact us. The potential imposition of trade tariffs by the US on imports from Canada, together with retaliatory tariffs by Canada on imports from the US, and other potential measures, including tariffs, duties, fees, economic sanctions or other trade measures, present risks to our business operations. Such measures, the nature, extent and timing of which are uncertain, could lead to increased costs for us and our customers and reduced demand for Canadian energy. The potential for such measures introduces uncertainty in North American energy markets, possibly disrupting supply chains and access to capital markets and jeopardizing our competitiveness, and could significantly impact our business. The US Government has also stated its interest in renegotiating and altering the Agreement between the United States of America, Mexico and Canada (USMCA), which could further impact the energy market and our business. Changing expectations of stakeholders and government policies regarding sustainability, ESG, climate change, and environmental protection practices continue to evolve and diverge, and an inability to meet these requirements and expectations could erode stakeholder trust and confidence, damage our reputation, influence actions or decisions about Enbridge and industry and have negative impacts on our business, operations or financial results. Companies across all sectors and industries are facing changing expectations and increasing scrutiny from a wide range of stakeholders related to their approach to sustainability and ESG matters of greatest relevance to their business and to their stakeholders. Our and other energy companies’ customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders have diverse expectations, demands and perspective on these topics, which are continuing to evolve. For example, companies in the energy industry, including Enbridge, have experienced stakeholder opposition to their operations and infrastructure projects, as well as organized opposition to the fossil fuel industry in general. Changing expectations of our practices and performance across these areas may result in or create exposure to new or heightened risks, which may include higher costs, project delays or cancellations, loss of ability to secure new growth opportunities or permits, restrictions on or the cessation of operations due to increasing pressure on governments and regulators, public opposition including protests, activism and legal action, such as the legal challenges to the operation of Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin. We may not be able to meet the diverse expectations and demands of all of our stakeholders, which could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees, and subject us to legal and operational risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 55

Page 56
Our operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with key stakeholders, including local communities, Indigenous groups and others directly impacted by our activities, as well as governments, regulatory agencies, investors and investor advocacy groups, investment funds, financial institutions, insurers and others, some of whom are increasingly focused on sustainability and ESG practices and performance. Enhanced public awareness of climate change has driven an increase in demand for lower-carbon forms of energy. In recent years, certain investors have been increasing investments in lower-carbon assets and businesses while decreasing the carbon intensity of their portfolios through, among other measures, divestment of companies with higher exposure to GHG-intensive operations and products. Commercial and investment banks and insurers have been pressured to reduce or cease providing financing and insurance coverage to the fossil fuel industry. Managing these risks requires significant effort and resources. Potential impacts could also include changing investor sentiment, impaired access to and increased cost of capital, and adverse impacts to the demand for, or value of, our services or our securities. In recent years, geopolitical uncertainty, slowing Canadian economy and continuing inflationary pressures have underscored the critical need for access to secure, affordable energy. The pace and scale of the transition to a lower-emission economy may pose a risk if Enbridge diversifies either too quickly or too slowly. Similarly, unexpected shifts in energy demands, including due to climate change concerns, can impact revenue through, for example, reduced throughput volumes on our pipeline transportation systems. The costs associated with meeting our ESG goals, including our GHG emissions reduction goals, could be significant. There is also a risk that some or all of the expected benefits and opportunities of achieving our ESG goals may fail to materialize, may cost more than anticipated to achieve, may not occur within the anticipated time periods, may fail to meet changing stakeholder expectations or may be challenged. Similarly, there is a risk that emissions reduction technologies do not materialize as expected, making it more difficult to reduce emissions. If we experience challenges, or perceived challenges, in achieving our ESG goals, meeting climate-related regulatory or reporting requirements, or meeting or managing stakeholder expectations regarding sustainability and ESG issues, it could have a negative impact on our reputation or investor sentiment or expose us to government enforcement actions or litigation, which may, in turn, impact our business, operations or financial results. Our forecasted assumptions may not materialize as expected, including on our expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures. We evaluate expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis. Planning and investment analysis is highly dependent on accurate forecasting and the use of appropriate assumptions and to the extent that these assumptions do not materialize, financial performance may be lower or more volatile than expected. Volatility and unpredictability in the economy, both locally and globally, and changes in cost estimates, project scoping and risk assessment could result in a loss of profits. Similarly, uncertainty in market signals, such as abrupt and unexpected shifts in energy costs and demands, have impacted and may in the future impact revenue, for example, from reduced throughput volumes on our pipeline transportation systems. We may encounter difficulties integrating the US Gas Utilities into our business in a successful manner, which may negatively affect the benefits we expect to obtain from the Acquisitions. In 2024, we completed the Acquisitions of the US Gas Utilities. 56

Page 57
The success of the Acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate the US Gas Utilities into our business in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves anticipated results. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition, including challenges integrating certain operations and functions, technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, cultural differences, and the retention of key personnel. The integration may be complex and time-consuming and involve delays or additional and unforeseen expenses. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business. Any failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisitions, additional unanticipated costs or other factors could negatively impact our earnings or cash flows, decrease or delay any beneficial effects of the Acquisitions and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not fully cover our losses in the event of an accident, natural disaster or other event, and we may encounter increased cost arising from the maintenance of, or lack of availability of, insurance. Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in our industry as described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors . We maintain an insurance program for Enbridge, our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates, to mitigate a certain portion of our risks. However, not all potential risks arising from our operations are insurable or are insured by us as a result of lack of availability, high premiums or other reasons. Enbridge self-insures a significant portion of certain risks through our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, and Enbridge’s insurance coverage is subject to terms and conditions, exclusions and large deductibles or self-insured retentions, which may reduce or eliminate coverage in certain circumstances. Enbridge’s insurance policies are generally renewed on an annual basis and, depending on factors such as market conditions, premiums, terms, policy limits and/or deductibles, can vary substantially. We can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates or on other terms that we consider commercially reasonable. In such a case, we may decide to self-insure additional risks. A significant self-insured loss, uninsured loss, a loss significantly exceeding the limits of our insurance policies, a significant delay in the payment of a major insurance claim, or the failure to renew insurance policies on similar or favorable terms, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is exposed to changes in market prices, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all risks and may result in material financial losses. In addition, any non-compliance with our risk management policies could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Our use of debt financing exposes us to changes in interest rates on both future fixed rate debt issuances and floating rate debt. While our financial results are denominated in Canadian dollars, many of our businesses have foreign currency revenues or expenses, particularly the US dollar. Changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could materially impact our financial results. We use financial derivatives to manage risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices, power prices and our share price, to reduce the volatility of our cash flows. Based on our risk management policies, substantially all of our financial derivatives are associated with an underlying asset, liability and/or forecasted transaction and are not intended for speculative purposes. These policies cannot, however, eliminate all risk, including unauthorized trading. Although this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function, we can provide no assurance that we will detect and prevent all unauthorized trading and other violations, particularly if deception, collusion or other intentional misconduct is involved, and any such violations could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. 57

Page 58
To the extent that we hedge our exposure to market prices, we will forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if these were to change in our favor. In addition, hedging activities can result in losses that might be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such losses have occurred in the past and could occur in the future. See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of our derivative instruments and related hedging activities. We rely on access to short-term and long-term capital markets to finance capital requirements and support liquidity needs. Cost effective access to those markets can be affected, particularly if we or our rated subsidiaries are unable to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. A significant portion of our consolidated asset base is financed with debt. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from assets. Accordingly, we rely on access to both short-term and long-term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations and to refinance investments originally financed with debt. Our senior unsecured long-term debt is currently rated investment-grade by various rating agencies. If the rating agencies were to rate us or our rated subsidiaries below investment- grade, our borrowing costs could increase, potentially significantly. Consequently, we could be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. We maintain revolving credit facilities at various entities to backstop commercial paper programs, for borrowings and for providing letters of credit. These facilities typically include financial covenants and failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude that entity from accessing the credit facility, which could impact liquidity. If our short-term debt rating were to be downgraded, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. Although this would not affect our ability to draw under our credit facilities, borrowing costs could be significantly higher. If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates or at all, our ability to finance operations and implement our strategy may be affected. An inability to access capital on favorable terms or at all may limit our ability to pursue enhancements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth or to refinance our existing indebtedness. Any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of our subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited, which in turn could increase our need to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries, thus reducing the liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group. Our Liquids Pipelines growth rate and results may be indirectly affected by commodity prices. Wide commodity price basis between Western Canada and global tidewater markets has negatively impacted producer netbacks and margins in the past that largely resulted from pipeline infrastructure takeaway capacity from producing regions in Western Canada and North Dakota, which are operating at capacity. A protracted long-term outlook for low crude oil prices could result in delay or cancellation of future projects. The tight conventional oil plays of Western Canada, the Permian Basin, and the Bakken region of North Dakota, have short cycle break-even time horizons, typically less than 24 months, and high decline rates that can be managed through active hedging programs and are positioned to react quickly to market signals. Accordingly, during periods of comparatively low prices, drilling programs, unsupported by hedging programs, may be reduced, and as such, supply growth from tight oil basins may be lower, which could impact volumes on our pipeline systems. Crude oil marketing generates margin by capitalizing on quality, time and location differentials when opportunities arise. Changing market conditions that impact the prices at which we buy and sell commodities have in the past limited margin opportunities and impeded our ability to cover capacity commitments and could do so again in the future. Other market conditions, such as backwardation, have likewise limited margin opportunities. 58

Page 59
Our Gas Transmission results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility. Within our US Midstream assets, we hold a 13.2% effective economic interest in DCP, which is engaged in the businesses of gathering, treating, processing and selling natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, we own Tomorrow RNG, which operates landfill gas-to-RNG production facilities and Aitken Creek Gas Storage Facility, which operates an underground natural gas storage facility . The financial results of these businesses are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in commodity prices. To a lesser degree, the financial results of our Gas Transmission business is subject to fluctuation in power prices, which impact electric power costs associated with operating some of our compressor stations. We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, counterparties, and vendors. We are exposed to the credit risk of multiple parties in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment-grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, or provide us with security to satisfy credit concerns. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in the creditworthiness of our customers, vendors, or counterparties. It is possible that payment or performance defaults from these entities, if significant, could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. Our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled and diverse workforce, and difficulties in recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans. Our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled and diverse workforce, including engineers, technical personnel, other professionals and executive officers and senior management. Enbridge and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry, and for some jobs the broader labor market, for this skilled workforce. If we are unable to retain current employees and/or recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals. RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL RISKS Many of our operations are regulated and failure to secure timely regulatory approval for our proposed projects, or loss of required approvals for our existing operations, could have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial results. The nature and degree of regulation and legislation affecting permitting and environmental review for energy infrastructure companies in Canada and the US continues to evolve. In addition, within the US and in Canada, energy companies continue to face opposition from anti-energy/anti-pipeline activists, environmental groups, politicians and other stakeholders concerned with the safety of energy infrastructure and its potential environmental effects. In the US, the EPA released rules to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, standards for reducing emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants, and rules to streamline the process for states and tribes to assume authority over the Clean Water Act' s section 404 permitting program for discharges of dredge and fill material. The Council for Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued its Phase 2 rule concerning analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), that may significantly change environmental scope and cost assessments for energy projects. The FERC has focused on the relationship between natural gas and electric power generation, particularly in connection with reliability issues during severe weather events. PHMSA issued rules updating requirements for sustainable and safe pipeline operation. Many regulations are being challenged in the courts, including the ability of the CEQ to promulgate regulations applicable to other federal agencies, and some have been overturned by reviewing courts. The new US administration may take further action to modify or reverse regulations that were promulgated by the current US administration. 59

Page 60
In Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a decision on the federal Impact Assessment Ac t (IAA), finding that it is largely outside of the federal Parliament's authority and that the IAA should focus more narrowly on effects within federal jurisdiction. The federal government amended the IAA in response to this decision; however, the scope and application of federal review of intraprovincial pipeline projects remains unclear. In November 2024, the Government of Alberta has again referred the issue to the Alberta Court of Appeal for hearing, to determine whether the IAA, as amended, is unconstitutional. As a result, the uncertainty for pipeline and other energy infrastructure projects in Canada is ongoing. These actions could adversely impact permitting of a wide range of energy projects. We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals for our operating assets or development projects. If there is a significant delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, if we fail to obtain or comply with them, or if laws or regulations change or are administered in a more stringent manner, the operations of existing facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented, delayed or become subject to additional costs. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations, and rules, including those relating to climate change, GHG emissions, climate-related disclosure, and anti- greenwashing, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations, affect or limit our business plans, expose us to environmental liabilities or litigation, and affect our reputation and relationships with stakeholders. We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our operations, including, but not limited to, air emissions, climate change, water, soil, land management, waste, hazardous substances, wildlife and protected species, biodiversity, noise, emergency response, and pollution. We are also subject to new and evolving laws, regulations and rules related to ESG and sustainability-related disclosure, including climate-related disclosure, and anti-greenwashing provisions, including recent amendments to Canadian competition legislation, which simultaneously increase stakeholder expectations to report environmental and climate-related information and also substantiate such information in accordance with standards that are still developing and evolving, and which may, in some cases conflict. Our exposure to these risks could result in adverse impacts to our reputation and relationships with stakeholders or increased costs, liabilities or litigation. If we are unable to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals and permits for our operating assets and projects, or if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or permits, the operation of existing facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented, delayed, or become subject to additional costs. Failure to comply with environmental laws, regulations, and rules may result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting our operating assets. We expect that changes in environmental laws, regulations, and rules, including those related to climate change, GHG emissions, climate-related disclosure, and anti- greenwashing, could result in a material increase in our cost of compliance with such laws and regulations, such as costs to monitor and report our emissions, install new emission controls to reduce emissions, and third-party substantiation, verification or assurance of our environmental data, the costs of which we may not be able to recover. Our operations are subject to operational regulation and other requirements, including compliance with easements and other land tenure documents, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and other requirements could have a negative impact on our reputation, business, operations or financial results. Operational risks relate to compliance with applicable operational rules and regulations mandated by governments, applicable regulatory authorities, or other requirements that may be found in easements, permits, or other agreements that provide a legal basis for our operations, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, awards of damages, operational restrictions or shutdowns, and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. 60

Page 61
We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines, facilities and other assets are located, and we obtain the right to construct and operate our pipelines and other assets from third parties or government entities. In addition, some of our pipelines, facilities and other assets cross Indigenous lands pursuant to rights-of-way or other land tenure interests. Our loss of these rights, including through our inability to renew them as they expire, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, operations and financial results. We have experienced litigation in relation to Line 5 and other easements. Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legal and Other Updates . Regulatory scrutiny of our assets and operations has the potential to increase operating costs or limit future projects. Regulatory enforcement actions issued by regulators for non-compliance can increase operating costs and negatively impact reputation. Potential regulatory changes and legal challenges could have an impact on our future earnings from operations and the cost related to the construction of new projects. Future actions of regulators may differ from current expectations, or future legislative changes may impact the regulatory environments in which we operate. While we seek to mitigate operational regulation risk by actively monitoring and consulting on potential regulatory requirement changes with the respective regulators directly, or through industry associations, and by developing response plans to regulatory changes or enforcement actions, such mitigation efforts may be ineffective or insufficient. While we believe the safe and reliable operation of our assets and adherence to existing regulations is the best approach to managing operational regulatory risk, the potential remains for regulators or other government officials to make unilateral decisions that could disrupt our operations or have an adverse financial impact on us. Our operations are subject to economic regulation and failure to secure regulatory approval for our proposed or existing commercial arrangements could have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial results. Our Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, and Gas Distribution and Storage assets face economic regulation risk. Broadly defined, economic regulation risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements or policies, including permits and regulatory approvals for both new and existing projects or agreements, upon which future and current operations are dependent. Our Mainline System, other liquids pipelines, gas transmission and distribution assets are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the CER, the FERC, the OEB, the Ohio Commission, the Utah Commission, the Wyoming Commission, the Idaho Commission, and the North Carolina Commission, with respect to the rates, tariffs, and tolls for these assets. The changing or rejection of commercial arrangements, including decisions by regulators on the applicable permits and tariff structure or changes in interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, has had in the past, and could in the future have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. Our Renewable Power Generation assets in Canada and the US are subject to directives, regulations, and policies of federal, provincial and state governments. These measures are variable and can change as a result of, among other things, tax rate changes and a change in the government, which can have a negative impact on our commercial arrangements. Our Renewable Power Generation assets in Europe (France, Germany and the UK) are also subject to the directives, regulations and policies established and enforced by the EU and the UK government. These measures are variable and can include price controls, caps and demand reduction goals, all of which can have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. 61

Page 62
We are subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new US, Canadian or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to taxes in the US, Canada and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the US Internal Revenue Service, the Canada Revenue Agency and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the US or Canada, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could adversely affect our financial results and reputation. We are subject to numerous legal proceedings related to our business and operations. In recent years, there has been an increase in climate-related regulatory action and litigation, including against companies involved in the energy industry. There is no assurance that we will not be impacted by such regulatory action, litigation, or other legal proceedings. By its nature, litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which we are involved or new matters could require additional expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could adversely affect our financial results or adversely affect our reputation. Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legal and Other Updates for a discussion of certain legal proceedings with recent developments. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance Oversight of cybersecurity is integrated into the responsibilities of the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for identifying and understanding Enbridge’s principal risks and ensuring that appropriate systems are implemented to monitor, manage and mitigate those risks. The committees of the Board have oversight over risks within their respective mandates. The Audit, Finance and Risk Committee (AFRC) provides primary oversight of cybersecurity matters, including with respect to financial risk and controls, integrity of financial data and public disclosures, and security of the cyber landscape across data and digital. Management provides quarterly cybersecurity reports to the AFRC and the Board and also reports to the Safety and Reliability Committee, as deemed necessary, on cybersecurity issues related to safety, reliability and operations. 62

Page 63
Each year, management prepares and provides to the Board and its committees a corporate risk assessment (CRA), which analyzes and prioritizes enterprise-wide risks, highlighting top risks and trends (including cybersecurity). The annual CRA is an integrated enterprise-wide process which engages each part of our business to assess and rank risks based on impact and probability. We strive to ensure that mitigation measures are appropriately designed, prioritized and resourced. The CRA report is reviewed by the Board committees with responsibility for the risk categories relevant to their mandate and is provided to the Board, which coordinates Enbridge's overall risk management approach. Complementary to the CRA, management prepares and provides to the Safety and Reliability Committee an annual top operational risk report that highlights the highest consequence operational risks across Enbridge and includes further detail on the risks and their treatment. This information helps inform the Board about the potential impact of top operational risks and of treatments in place to manage those risks. Cybersecurity has been identified as a top risk, as attacks against participants in our industry have continued to increase in sophistication and frequency over the years. Although we devote significant resources and security measures to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect our systems and data, we (and our third-party vendors) have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber attacks of varying degrees in the conduct of our business, including, for example, denial of service attacks. Cybersecurity risk is described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Enbridge’s management is responsible for the implementation of risk management strategies and monitoring performance. The technology and information services (TIS) function is centralized under the Senior Vice President & Chief Information Officer (CIO). We also engage independent third parties to assess our cybersecurity program, track their recommendations, and use those to further improve the program. Reporting to the CIO is the Chief Information Security Officer who is in charge of our cybersecurity program and oversees the 24x7x365 Security Operations Center (SOC). We conduct continuous assessments of our cybersecurity standards, perform regular tests of our ability to respond and recover, and monitor for potential threats. To further mitigate threats, we collaborate with governments and regulatory agencies and take part in external events to learn and share. Our workforce participates in regular security awareness training, including exercises to build capabilities to identify and report suspect phishing emails to our SOC. In the last year, we continued to expand the cybersecurity training and simulated testing we administer to high-risk groups within the organization. A tailored cybersecurity training course has been implemented for team members in operational technology roles, and we have increased the frequency of phishing simulation tests. We have a cybersecurity third-party risk management program, which is an evolving, cross-functional program to help assess and mitigate risks from third-party vendors and other service providers. Our cybersecurity team also uses several layers of defense and protection technologies, cybersecurity experts, and automated alerting and response mechanisms to reduce risk to Enbridge. Although cybersecurity risks have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, to date, we have experienced an increasing number of cybersecurity threats in recent years. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the risk factor entitled " Cyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents pose threats to our technology systems and could materially adversely affect our business, operations, reputation or financial results." in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 63

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Descriptions of our properties and maps depicting the locations of our liquids, natural gas, and renewable power systems are included in Part I. Item 1. Busin ess. In general, our systems are located on land owned by others and are operated under easements and rights-of-way, licenses, leases or permits that have been granted by private landowners, Indigenous communities, public authorities, railways or public utilities. Our liquids pipeline systems have pumping stations, tanks, terminals and certain other facilities that are located on land that is owned by us and/or used by us under easements, licenses, leases or permits. Additionally, our natural gas pipeline systems have natural gas compressor stations, the vast majority of which are located on land that is owned by us. The remainder of these compressor stations and other assets, such as meter and valve stations, and underground gas storage fields, are used by us under easements, leases or permits. Titles to Enbridge owned properties or affiliate entities may be subject to encumbrances in some cases. We believe that none of these burdens should materially detract from the value of these properties or materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved in various legal and regulatory actions and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the final outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of such actions and proceedings will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legal and Other Updates for discussion of certain legal proceedings with recent developments. SEC regulations require the disclosure of any proceeding under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party unless the registrant reasonably believes it will not result in monetary sanctions over a certain threshold. Given the size of our operations, we have elected to use a threshold of US$1 million for the purposes of determining proceedings requiring disclosure. We have no such proceedings to disclose in this annual report. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 64

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with "Forward-Looking Information" and "Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures", Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. For discussion of 2022 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS MAINLINE TOLLING AGREEMENT The Mainline Tolling Settlement (MTS) is a negotiated settlement with a term of seven and a half years through the end of 2028 that covers both the Canadian and US portions of the Mainline, except for Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. Enbridge Inc. (Enbridge) filed an application with the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER) for approval of the MTS on December 15, 2023 and the CER issued an order on March 4, 2024 approving Enbridge’s application as filed. Refer to Part I. Item I. Business - Business Segments - Liquids Pipelines - Tolling Framework for detailed terms of the MTS. ACQUISITIONS US Gas Utilities On September 5, 2023, Enbridge entered into three separate definitive agreements with Dominion Energy, Inc. to acquire The East Ohio Gas Company (EOG), Questar Gas Company (Questar) and its related Wexpro companies (Wexpro), and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated (PSNC) (together, the Acquisitions). On September 30, 2024, we acquired all of the membership interests of Fall North Carolina Holdco LLC, which owns 100% of PSNC, for cash consideration of $2.7 billion (US$2.0 billion) (the PSNC Acquisition). PSNC is a public utility primarily engaged in the purchase, sale, transportation and distribution of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers in North Carolina. PSNC operates under rates approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission (North Carolina Commission). Subsequent to its acquisition, PSNC conducts business as Enbridge Gas North Carolina. On May 31, 2024, we acquired all of the membership interests of Fall West Holdco LLC which owns 100% of Questar and Wexpro for cash consideration of $4.1 billion (US$3.0 billion) (the Questar Acquisition). Questar is a public natural gas utility providing distribution, storage and transmission services to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Utah, southwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho. The Utah Public Service Commission (Utah Commission), the Wyoming Public Service Commission (Wyoming Commission), and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (Idaho Commission) have granted Questar the necessary regulatory approvals to serve these areas. Wexpro develops and produces cost-of-service gas reserves for Questar and operates under agreements with the states of Utah and Wyoming. Subsequent to its acquisition, Questar conducts business as Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming, and Enbridge Gas Idaho in those respective states. 67

Page 68
On March 6, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of EOG for cash consideration of $5.8 billion (US$4.3 billion) (the EOG Acquisition). EOG is a public natural gas utility providing distribution, storage and transmission services to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio and is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (Ohio Commission). Subsequent to its acquisition, EOG conducts business as Enbridge Gas Ohio. The Acquisitions further diversify, and are complementary to, our existing gas distribution operations. Joint Venture with WhiteWater/I Squared and MPLX On May 29, 2024, we formed a joint venture (the Whistler Parent JV) with WhiteWater/I Squared Capital (WhiteWater/I Squared) and MPLX LP (MPLX) that will develop, construct, own and operate natural gas pipeline and storage assets connecting Permian Basin natural gas supply to growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other US Gulf Coast demand. The Whistler Parent JV is owned by WhiteWater/I Squared (50.6%), MPLX (30.4%) and Enbridge (19.0%) and owns the following assets: • a 100% interest in the Whistler Pipeline, a 450-mile intrastate pipeline transporting natural gas from the Waha Header in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas; • a 100% interest in the Rio Bravo Pipeline project, two new parallel 137-mile pipelines transporting natural gas from the Agua Dulce supply area to NextDecade's Rio Grande LNG project in Brownsville, Texas; • a 70% interest in the ADCC Pipeline, a new 40-mile pipeline which was placed into service in July 2024 and is designed to transport 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of natural gas from the terminus of the Whistler Pipeline in Agua Dulce, Texas to Cheniere's Corpus Christi LNG export facility; and • a 50% interest in Waha Gas Storage, a 2.0 bcf gas storage cavern facility connecting to key Permian egress pipelines including the Whistler Pipeline. In connection with the formation of the Whistler Parent JV, we contributed our 100% interest in the Rio Bravo Pipeline project and $487 million (US$357 million) of cash to the Whistler Parent JV. In addition to our 19.0% equity interest in the Whistler Parent JV, we received a special equity interest in the Whistler Parent JV which provides for a 25.0% economic interest in the Rio Bravo Pipeline project. This interest is subject to certain redemption rights held by Whitewater/I Squared and MPLX. After the closing on May 29, 2024, we accrued for our share of the post-closing mandatory capital expenditures of approximately US$150 million for the Rio Bravo Pipeline project. Additional capital expenditures to complete the Rio Bravo Pipeline project will be proportionate to our economic interest. Acquisition of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Facilities On January 2, 2024, through a wholly-owned US subsidiary, we acquired six Morrow Renewables operating landfill gas-to-RNG production facilities (Tomorrow RNG) located in Texas and Arkansas for total consideration of $1.3 billion (US$1.0 billion), of which $584 million (US$439 million) was paid at close and an additional deferred consideration is payable within two years with a fair value of $757 million (US$568 million). The acquired assets align with and advance our lower-carbon strategy. ASSET MONETIZATION Disposition of Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable Interests On April 1, 2024, we closed the sale of our 50.0% interest in the Alliance Pipeline, our interest in Aux Sable (including a 42.7% interest in Aux Sable Midstream LLC and Aux Sable Liquid Products L.P., and a 50.0% interest in Aux Sable Canada LP) and our interest in NRGreen Power Limited Partnership (NRGreen) to Pembina Pipeline Corporation (Pembina) for $3.1 billion, including $327 million of non- recourse debt. A gain on disposal of $1.1 billion before tax, which is net of $1.0 billion of the goodwill from our Gas Transmission segment allocated to the disposal group, is included in Gain on disposition of equity investments in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. 68

GAS TRANSMISSION RATE PROCEEDINGS Texas Eastern In May 2024, Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) reached a negotiated settlement with customers to increase rates starting October 1, 2024 with additional increases on January 1, 2026. Texas Eastern filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on June 3, 2024 and received approval on July 31, 2024 from the FERC of its uncontested settlement with customers. Algonquin Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC (Algonquin) filed a rate case on May 30, 2024. On June 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting and suspending tariff records, subject to refund, conditions, and establishing hearing procedures. In December 2024, Algonquin reached a settlement in principle with customers which will be filed for FERC approval in the first quarter 2025. If approved, rates will be effective December 1, 2024. Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline (M&N) US filed a rate case on May 30, 2024. On June 27, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting and suspending tariff records, subject to refund, conditions, and establishing hearing procedures. In December 2024, M&N US reached a settlement in principle with customers which will be filed for FERC approval in the first quarter 2025. If approved, rates will be effective January 1, 2025. GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE RATE APPLICATIONS Incentive Regulation Rate Application In October 2022, Enbridge Gas Inc. (Enbridge Gas Ontario) filed its application with the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) to establish a 2024 through 2028 Incentive Regulation (IR) rate setting framework. The application initially sought approval in two phases to establish 2024 base rates (Phase 1) on a cost-of- service basis and to establish a price cap rate setting mechanism (Phase 2) to be used for the remainder of the IR term (2025-2028). A third phase (Phase 3) has been established with the OEB as part of the Phase 1 Partial Settlement Proposal (Phase 1 Settlement). Phase 3 will address cost allocation and the harmonization of rates and rate classes between legacy rate zones, and is anticipated to be completed in 2025. In August 2023, the OEB approved the Phase 1 Settlement and in December 2023, the OEB issued its Decision and Order on the remaining unsettled items in Phase 1 (Phase 1 Decision). These decisions include the following findings or orders: • energy transition risk requires us to carry out a risk assessment to consider further risk mitigation measures in three areas: system access and expansion capital spending, system renewal capital spending and depreciation policy; • all new small volume customers wishing to connect to natural gas are to pay their full connection costs as an upfront charge (the revenue horizon was set to zero years), rather than through rates over time effective January 2025; • approval of a harmonized depreciation methodology that reduced the amount of depreciation sought and adjusted asset lives including extensions of service life for certain asset classes; • the removal of $84 million of undepreciated integration capital costs from 2024 rate base; and • an increase in equity thickness from 36% to 38% effective 2024. 69

Page 70
Enbridge Gas Ontario filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ontario Divisional Court in January 2024 regarding various aspects of the Phase 1 Decision and subsequently filed an amended Notice of Appeal in December 2024 (Amended Appeal). The Amended Appeal focused on two aspects of the Phase 1 Decision: asset class average useful lives for depreciation purposes, and equity thickness. In January 2024, Enbridge Gas Ontario filed a Notice of Motion with the OEB requesting the OEB to review and vary the Phase 1 Decision which was subsequently amended in May 2024 (Amended Motion). The Amended Motion focused on two aspects of the Phase 1 Decision: asset class average useful lives for depreciation purposes, and the recoverability of integration capital. In October 2024, the OEB issued a decision on the Amended Motion and determined that only the issue of integration capital met the threshold to warrant a review. We are currently awaiting an OEB decision on the issue of integration capital. In May 2024, Bill 165, the Keeping Energy Costs Down Act, received royal assent, giving the Government of Ontario time-limited authority to set the revenue horizon for small volume customers, effectively reversing that aspect of the OEB's Phase 1 Decision. Regulations are now in place setting the revenue horizon for new customer connections to 40 years. In November 2024, the OEB issued its Decision approving the Phase 2 Partial Settlement Proposal (Phase 2 Settlement). The Phase 2 Settlement establishes a price cap IR rate setting mechanism to be used for establishing rates for 2025 – 2028. The price cap mechanism will establish new rates each year through an annual base rate adjustment to migrate an incremental $50 million in capitalized overheads to operating and maintenance costs, annual base rate escalation at inflation less a 0.28% productivity factor, annual updates for certain costs to be passed through to customers, and where applicable, it will provide for the recovery of material unexpected events and discrete incremental capital investments beyond those that can be funded through base rates. The price cap mechanism includes the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires Enbridge Gas Ontario to share equally with customers any earnings in excess of 100 basis points over the allowed return on equity (ROE), and 90% of any earnings in excess of 300 basis points over the allowed ROE. Issues not addressed as part of the Phase 2 Settlement proceeded to hearing in December 2024 and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2025. Enbridge Gas Ohio In October 2023, Enbridge Gas Ohio filed its base rate case and schedules with the Ohio Commission. Enbridge Gas Ohio proposed a non-fuel, base rate annual revenue increase of $212 million, projected to be effective January 2025. The base rate increase was proposed to recover the significant investment in distribution infrastructure for the benefit of Ohio customers. The proposed rates would have provided for an ROE of 10.40% compared to the currently authorized ROE of 10.38%. In addition, Enbridge Gas Ohio requested approval for an alternative rate plan for the continuation and modification of certain programs, including Pipeline Infrastructure Replacement and Capital Expenditure Program. On December 18, 2024, Enbridge Gas Ohio filed a Notice of Intent to Modify Filed Positions. The Notice of Intent indicated a willingness to accept a reduced annual revenue requirement increase (from $212 million to $60 million) and, if the reduced position were adopted, to forgo filing a new base rate case until October 31, 2027. The hearing began on January 13, 2025, and remains underway. 70

FINANCING UPDATE We completed long-term debt issuances totaling US$5.7 billion and $1.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024. On the March 8, 2024 call date, we redeemed at par all of the outstanding US$700 million three-year callable, 5.97% senior notes that carried an original maturity date in March 2026. During our annual renewal process, we renewed and extended approximately $17.6 billion of our credit facilities with maturities ranging from 2025-2029. We also increased our letter of credit facilities by approximately $346 million and entered into new term loans with maturities ranging from 2029-2049 totaling approximately $542 million. On May 15, 2024, we established an at-the-market equity issuance program (ATM Program) which provided us with additional flexibility to fund the Acquisitions. From May 15, 2024 to July 31, 2024, 51,298,629 common shares were issued on Canadian and US exchanges at average prices of CAD$48.72 and US$35.77 per common share for aggregate gross proceeds of $2.50 billion. On August 1, 2024, we terminated the ATM Program. On September 8, 2023, we closed a public offering of 102,913,500 common shares at a price of $44.70 per share for gross proceeds of $4.6 billion which were also used to finance a portion of the aggregate cash consideration payable for the Acquisitions discussed in Note 6 - Acquisitions and Dispositions. Our 2024 financing activities have provided significant liquidity that we expect will enable us to fund our current portfolio of capital projects and acquisitions without requiring access to the capital markets for the next 12 months should market access be restricted or pricing be unattractive. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources . As at December 31, 2024, after adjusting for the impact of floating-to-fixed interest rate swap hedges, less than 5% of our total debt is exposed to floating rates. Refer to Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 23 - Risk Management and Financial Instruments for more information on our interest rate hedging program. 71

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts) Segment earnings/(loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization 1 Liquids Pipelines 9,531 9,383 7,941 Gas Transmission 5,656 4,264 3,126 Gas Distribution and Storage 2,869 1,592 1,827 Renewable Power Generation 733 149 262 Eliminations and Other (1,904) 916 (1,118) Earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization 1 16,885 16,304 12,038 Depreciation and amortization (5,167) (4,613) (4,317) Interest expense (4,419) (3,812) (3,179) Income tax expense (1,668) (1,821) (1,604) (Earnings)/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests (190) 133 65 Preference share dividends (388) (352) (414) Earnings attributable to common shareholders 5,053 5,839 2,589 Earnings per common share attributable to common shareholders 2.34 2.84 1.28 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to common shareholders 2.34 2.84 1.28 1 Non-GAAP financial measures. EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS Year ended December 31, 2024 compared with year ended December 31, 2023 Earnings attributable to common shareholders decreased by $1.1 billion due to certain infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following: • a non-cash, net unrealized loss of $2.1 billion ($1.6 billion after-tax) in 2024, compared with a net unrealized gain of $1.2 billion ($911 million after-tax) in 2023, reflecting changes in the mark-to- market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity price risk; • the absence in 2024 of a gain of $151 million ($129 million after-tax) net of a deferred tax adjustment of $69 million recognized as a result of the discontinuation of regulatory accounting for Southern Lights Pipeline; • an asset impairment loss of $137 million ($103 million after-tax) related to the Big Sandy Pipeline; • severance costs of $105 million ($79 million after-tax) as a result of a workforce reduction in February 2024; • $137 million ($114 million after-tax) of integration and transaction costs incurred related to the Acquisitions in 2024, as compared to $31 million ($24 million after-tax) of transaction costs in 2023; • the absence of the receipt of a litigation claim settlement of $68 million ($52 million after-tax); and • an impairment loss of $55 million ($49 million after-tax) related to certain renewable assets. 72

Page 73
The factors above were partially offset by: • a gain on sale of $1.1 billion ($765 million after-tax) related to the disposition of interests in the Alliance Pipeline, Aux Sable and NRGreen; • the absence in 2024 of: ◦ a realized loss of $638 million ($479 million after-tax) due to termination of foreign exchange hedges, as foreign exchange risks inherent within the Competitive Tolling Settlement (CTS) framework are not present in the negotiated MTS; ◦ an impairment of $281 million ($232 million after-tax) recognized to certain capital projects, capital costs and pension balances in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of the OEB's Phase 1 Decision; ◦ a provision adjustment of $124 million ($95 million after-tax) related to a litigation matter; ◦ an asset retirement loss of $86 million ($65 million after-tax) related to our Alberta Regional Oil Sands System; and • a deferred tax recovery of $141 million in 2024 due to change in state apportionment as a result of the Acquisitions. The non-cash, unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses discussed above generally arise as a result of our comprehensive economic hedging program to mitigate foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks. This program creates volatility in reported short-term earnings through the recognition of unrealized non-cash gains and losses on derivative instruments used to hedge these risks. Over the long-term, we believe our hedging program supports the reliable cash flows and dividend growth upon which our investor value proposition is based. After taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $294 million increase in earnings attributable to common shareholders is primarily explained by the following significant business factors: • contributions from Enbridge Gas Ohio, Enbridge Gas Utah and Wexpro, and Enbridge Gas North Carolina, and higher distribution charges resulting from increases in customer base and higher demand in the contract market from Enbridge Gas Ontario in our Gas Distribution and Storage segment; • higher contributions from our Gas Transmission segment primarily due to favorable contracting and lower operating costs in our US Gas Transmission assets, and acquisitions of Tres Palacios and Aitken Creek in 2023, Tomorrow RNG, and Whistler Parent JV in 2024; • higher contributions from our Renewable Power Generation segment due to the generation of investment tax credits from our investment in Fox Squirrel Solar and the acquisition of an additional 24.45% interest in the Hohe See and Albatros Offshore Wind Facilities in November 2023; • higher contributions from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to lower Mainline power costs and discontinuation of rate-regulated accounting of Southern Lights Pipeline as at December 31, 2023; and • higher investment income in Eliminations and Other from the pre-funding of the Acquisitions and from our wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries; partially offset by • full year of lower Mainline system tolls in our Liquids Pipelines segment as a result of revised tolls effective July 1, 2023 and lower Line 3 Replacement (L3R) surcharge; • lower contributions from Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable from our Gas Transmission segment due to the sale of our interest in these investments in April 2024; • higher interest expense primarily due to higher average principal outstanding resulting from the Acquisitions; • higher depreciation and amortization expense mainly driven by acquisitions we completed in 2023 and 2024, as mentioned above; • higher income tax expense largely driven by higher earnings and higher US minimum tax; and • higher realized foreign exchange loss on hedge settlements in Eliminations and Other in 2024. 73

REVENUES We generate revenues from three primary sources: transportation and other services, gas distribution sales and commodity sales. Transportation and other services revenues of $19.7 billion, $19.2 billion and $17.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were earned from our crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation businesses and also include power generation revenues from our portfolio of renewable and power generation assets. For our transportation assets operating under market-based arrangements, revenues are driven by volumes transported and the corresponding tolls for transportation services. For assets operating under take-or-pay contracts, revenues reflect the terms of the underlying contract for services or capacity. For rate-regulated assets, revenues are charged in accordance with tolls established by the regulator and, in most cost-of-service based arrangements, are reflective of our cost to provide the service plus a regulator-approved rate of return. Gas distribution sales revenues of $6.8 billion, $5.4 billion and $6.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were recognized in a manner consistent with the underlying rate-setting mechanism mandated by the regulator. Revenues generated by the gas distribution businesses are primarily driven by volumes delivered, which vary with weather and customer composition and utilization, as well as regulator-approved rates. The cost of natural gas is passed through rates to customers and does not ultimately impact earnings due to its flow-through nature. Commodity sales revenues of $27.0 billion, $19.0 billion and $29.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were generated primarily through our crude oil marketing, natural gas and power marketing businesses. This includes the purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas, power and NGL to generate a margin, which is typically a small fraction of gross revenue. Sales revenue generated from these operations reflect activity levels which are driven by differences in commodity prices between locations, grades and points in time, rather than on absolute prices. Commodity sales revenues also include revenue generated from our Tomorrow RNG business. Any residual commodity margin risk is closely monitored and managed. Revenues from these operations depend on activity levels, which vary from year-to-year depending on market conditions and commodity prices. Our revenues also include changes in unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses related to foreign exchange and commodity price contracts used to manage exposures from movements in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The mark-to-market accounting creates volatility and impacts the comparability of revenues in the short-term, but we believe over the long-term, the economic hedging program supports reliable cash flows. 74

BUSINESS SEGMENTS LIQUIDS PIPELINES Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization 9,531 9,383 7,941 Year ended December 31, 2024 compared with year ended December 31, 2023 EBITDA was negatively impacted by $71 million due to certain infrequent or other non-operating factors, primarily explained by the following: • a non-cash, net unrealized gain of $2 million in 2024, compared with a net unrealized gain of $615 million in 2023, reflecting net fair value gains and losses arising from changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity price risks; and • the absence in 2024 of both a gain of $151 million recognized as a result of Southern Lights' discontinuation of regulatory accounting and the receipt of a litigation claim settlement of $68 million, partially offset by • the absence in 2024 of both a realized loss of $638 million due to termination of foreign exchange hedges, as foreign exchange risks inherent within the CTS framework are not present in the negotiated MTS and an asset retirement loss of $86 million related to our Alberta Regional Oil Sands System; and • a net positive adjustment to crude oil inventory of $15 million in 2024, compared with a net negative adjustment of $16 million in 2023. After taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $219 million increase is primarily explained by the following significant business factors: • lower Mainline power costs from operational efficiencies and lower Alberta mill rates; • higher contributions from the Southern Lights Pipeline due primarily to the discontinuation of rate- regulated accounting as at December 31, 2023; • higher contributions from the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent System due primarily to higher volumes on the Flanagan South Pipeline driven by the open season commitments that commenced in the first quarter of 2024, and the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center due to higher demand and new storage contracts that commenced in the second quarter of 2024; and • the favorable effect of translating US dollar EBITDA at a higher average exchange rate in 2024, as compared to 2023, partially offset by • full year of lower Mainline System tolls as a result of revised tolls effective July 1, 2023 and a lower L3R surcharge. 75

GAS TRANSMISSION Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization 5,656 4,264 3,126 Year ended December 31, 2024 compared with year ended December 31, 2023 EBITDA was positively impacted by $1,008 million due to certain infrequent or other non-operating factors primarily explained by the following: • a gain on sale of $1,063 million on the disposition of interests in the Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable; and • the absence in 2024 of both a negative provision adjustment of $124 million related to a litigation matter and an impairment loss of $82 million related to certain Offshore equity investments, partially offset by • an asset impairment loss of $137 million related to the Big Sandy Pipeline; • a non-cash, net unrealized loss of $3 million in 2024, compared with a net unrealized gain of $32 million in 2023, reflecting changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk; • a non-cash revaluation loss of $33 million to the gas inventory at Aitken Creek; and • a loss of $29 million as a result of the contribution of our 100% interest in the Rio Bravo Pipeline project to the Whistler Parent JV. After taking into consideration the factors above, we saw a $384 million increase, primarily explained by the following significant business factors: • favorable contracting and lower operating costs on our US Gas Transmission assets; • contributions from the acquisitions of Tres Palacios in the second quarter of 2023, Aitken Creek in the fourth quarter of 2023, Tomorrow RNG in the first quarter of 2024 and Whistler Parent JV in the second quarter of 2024; and • the favorable effect of translating US dollar EBITDA at a higher average exchange rate in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by • lower contributions from Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable due to the sale of our interests in these investments in April 2024. GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization 2,869 1,592 1,827 Year ended December 31, 2024 compared with year ended December 31, 2023 EBITDA was positively impacted by $281 million due to the absence in 2024 of an impairment of $281 million recognized to certain capital projects, capital costs and pension balances in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of the OEB's Phase 1 Decision. 76

Page 77
After taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $996 million increase is primarily explained by contributions from Enbridge Gas Ohio, Enbridge Gas Utah and Wexpro, and Enbridge Gas North Carolina since their acquisitions in 2024. In addition, the increase is also explained by: • higher distribution charges resulting from increases in customer base and higher demand in the contract market at Enbridge Gas Ontario, partially offset by • warmer than normal weather in 2024, when compared with the normal weather forecast embedded in rates, which negatively impacted Enbridge Gas Ontario 2024 EBITDA by approximately $58 million period over period. RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization 733 149 262 Year ended December 31, 2024 compared with year ended December 31, 2023 EBITDA was positively impacted by $295 million due to certain infrequent or non-operating factors, primarily explained by: • the absence in 2024 of an impairment loss of $261 million to Chapman Ranch wind facilities; • a non-cash, net unrealized loss of $13 million in 2024, compared with a net unrealized loss of $72 million in 2023, reflecting changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity price risks; and • a gain on sale of $29 million related to disposition of our interest in NRGreen, partially offset by • an impairment loss of $55 million related to certain assets. After taking into consideration the positive factors above, the remaining $289 million increase is primarily explained by the following significant business factors: • contributions from our investment in Fox Squirrel Solar as a result of the generation of investment tax credits; • higher contribution from the Hohe See and Albatros Offshore Wind Facilities as a result of the November 2023 acquisition of an additional 24.45% interest in these facilities; and • strong wind resources at European offshore wind facilities. ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Earnings/(loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (1,904) 916 (1,118) Eliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs that are not allocated to business segments, the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements and the activities of our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. Eliminations and Other also includes our natural gas and power marketing businesses and the impact of new business development activities and corporate investments. 77

Page 78
Year ended December 31, 2024 compared with year ended December 31, 2023 EBITDA was negatively impacted by $3,098 billion due to certain infrequent or non-operating factors, primarily explained by: • a non-cash, net unrealized loss of $2.2 billion in 2024, compared with a net unrealized gain of $688 million in 2023, reflecting changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity price risks; • severance costs of $105 million as a result of a workforce reduction in February 2024; • $137 million of integration and transaction costs incurred related to the Acquisitions in 2024, as compared to $31 million of transaction costs in 2023; and • a non-cash, net unrealized loss of $15 million in 2024, compared with a net unrealized gain of $35 million in 2023, reflecting changes in the mark-to-market value of equity fund investments held by our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. After taking into consideration the non-operating factors above, we saw a $278 million increase in EBITDA that is primarily explained by: • higher investment income from the pre-funding of the Acquisitions and from our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries; and • timing of certain operating and administrative cost recoveries from the business units, partially offset by • higher realized foreign exchange loss on hedge settlements in 2024. 78

Page 80
The following commercially secured growth projects are currently in various stages of construction: GAS TRANSMISSION • Texas Eastern Venice Extension Project – A reversal and expansion of Texas Eastern’s Line 40 from its existing New Roads compressor station to a new delivery point with the proposed Gator Express pipeline just south of Texas Eastern’s Larose compressor station. The project is expected to deliver 1.5 bcf/d of natural gas to Venture Global Plaquemines LNG, LLC’s LNG export facility located in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana and is underpinned by long-term take or pay contracts. • Texas Eastern Modernization – This program is the modernization of compression facilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to increase safety and reliability and reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions at multiple sites on our Texas Eastern system. The program is expected to be completed in stages over a period of years beginning in 2024. • T-North Expansion (Aspen Point) – An expansion of Westcoast Energy Inc.'s (Westcoast) British Columbia (BC) Pipeline in northern BC that includes pipeline looping, additional compressor units and other ancillary station modifications to support 535 million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) of additional capacity. The expansion is to serve growing regional demand for natural gas and potential west coast LNG exports and will be underpinned by a cost-of-service commercial model with a target in-service date of 2026. T-North Expansion received regulatory approval from the CER in December 2024. • Tennessee Ridgeline Expansion – The Tennessee Ridgeline Expansion project is an expansion of the East Tennessee Natural Gas (ETNG) system that will provide additional natural gas for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to support the replacement of an existing coal-fired power plant as TVA continues to transition its power generation mix towards lower-carbon fuels. The proposed scope includes the installation of approximately 125 miles of 30-inch pipeline looping, one electric-powered compressor station, and an 8-megawatt behind-the-meter solar array. • Woodfibre LNG Project – Construction of liquefaction and floating storage facilities in Squamish, BC, and an expansion of the BC Pipeline System. Construction of the facilities is executed by our partner; Enbridge holds a non-controlling interest in this project. The project is expected to be placed into service in 2027. • T-South Expansion (Sunrise) – An expansion of Westcoast's BC Pipeline's T-South section that includes pipeline looping, additional compressor units and other ancillary station modifications to support 300 mmcf/d of additional capacity. The expansion is driven primarily by an anticipated shortfall in capacity to deliver gas to the BC Lower Mainland and US Pacific Northwest markets following the commencement of deliveries to the Woodfibre LNG project, which is expected to come into service in 2027. The project is underpinned by a cost-of-service commercial model and is expected to be placed in service in 2028. We filed the regulatory application with the CER in May 2024. • Canyon System Pipelines – The project includes the construction of two new offshore pipelines in the US Gulf Coast to deliver natural gas and crude oil from BP Exploration & Production Company's Kaskida offshore project. The development includes a new 24/26-inch oil pipeline which will connect to Shell Pipeline Company LP's Green Canyon 19 Platform, and a 12-inch gas pipeline connecting to Enbridge's Magnolia Gas Gathering System. 80

Page 81
GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE • Moriah Energy Center – Moriah Energy Center is an LNG facility that is under construction in Person County, North Carolina with 2 bcf storage capacity. The facility is required to ensure system reliability and address supply constraints due to customer growth and will be designed with trucking capabilities to support other LNG facilities. The construction started in first quarter of 2024 and is expected to achieve completion in 2027. • T-15 Reliability Project – The T-15 Reliability Project includes the construction of 45 miles of transmission pipe, a compressor station and associated metering and regulation facilities in Rockingham, Caswell, and Person counties in North Carolina. The project is expected to start construction in 2026 and to achieve two-phased project completion in 2027 and 2028. RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION • Fox Squirrel Solar – Fox Squirrel Solar is a fully contracted, ground-mounted solar facility in Ohio with expected installed capacity of approximately 577 megawatts (MW). All three phases of the project are currently in service. Project revenues are underpinned by a 20-year fixed price power purchase agreement (PPA). • Sequoia Solar Project – Sequoia Solar Project is an 815-megawatt solar farm located approximately 150 miles west of Dallas, Texas. The two-phased project is expected to achieve project completion in 2025 and 2026. Project revenues are underpinned by long-term fixed price PPAs. • Calvados Offshore Wind Project – Calvados is an offshore wind project located off the northwest coast of France that is expected to generate approximately 448 MW. Project revenues are underpinned by a 20-year fixed price PPA. OTHER ANNOUNCED PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT The following project has been announced by us, but has not yet met our criteria to be classified as commercially secured: RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION Seven Stars Energy Project On June 24, 2024, Enbridge and Six Nations Energy Development LP, a newly-created consortium of Cowessess, George Gordon, Kahkewistahaw, Pasqua and White Bear First Nations, as well as Métis Nation-Saskatchewan, announced plans to advance development of a new wind energy project southeast of Weyburn, Saskatchewan. The Seven Stars Energy Project (the Project) is expected to produce 200 MW of wind power. It will be developed, constructed and operated by Enbridge. Financial participation of the partners is expected to be supported, in part, by loan guarantees of up to $100 million from the Saskatchewan Indigenous Investment Finance Corporation. Our Indigenous partners have an opportunity to acquire equity ownership of at least 30% in the Project. The Project is targeted to be operational in 2027, subject to finalizing commercial agreements, securing the necessary environmental and regulatory approvals, and meeting investment criteria. We also have a portfolio of additional projects under development that have not yet progressed to the point of commercial securement. 81

Page 82
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The maintenance of financial strength and flexibility is fundamental to our growth strategy, particularly in light of the significant number and size of capital projects and acquisitions currently secured or under development. Access to timely funding from capital markets could be limited by factors outside our control including, but not limited to, financial market volatility resulting from economic and political events both inside and outside North America. To mitigate such risks, we actively manage financial plans and strategies to ensure we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet routine operating and future capital requirements. In the near term, we generally expect to utilize cash from operations together with commercial paper issuance and/or credit facility draws and the proceeds of capital market offerings to fund liabilities as they become due, finance capital expenditures and acquisitions, fund debt retirements and pay common and preference share dividends. We target maintaining sufficient liquidity through the use of committed credit facilities with a diversified group of banks and financial institutions to enable us to fund all anticipated requirements for approximately one year without accessing the capital markets. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term contracts, annual debt maturities and related interest obligations, rights-of-way and leases. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 - Debt and Note 26 - Leases for amounts outstanding at December 31, 2024, related to debt and leases, respectively. Long-term contracts are contracts that we have signed for the purchase of services, pipe and other materials totaling $10.8 billion which are expected to be paid over the next five years. Remaining long- term contracts primarily consist of the following purchase obligations: firm capacity payments for natural gas and crude oil transportation and storage contracts, natural gas purchase commitments, service and product purchase obligations and power commitments. Our financing plan is regularly updated to reflect evolving capital requirements and financial market conditions and identifies a variety of potential sources of debt and equity funding alternatives. CAPITAL MARKET ACCESS We ensure ready access to capital markets, subject to market conditions, through maintenance of shelf prospectuses that allow for issuance of long-term debt, equity and other forms of long-term capital when market conditions are attractive. In accordance with our funding plan, we completed the following long- term debt issuances totaling US$5.7 billion and $1.8 billion in 2024: Entity Issuance date Type of issuance Amount (in millions of Canadian dollars, unless stated otherwise) Enbridge Inc. April 2024 senior notes US$3,500 Enbridge Inc. June 2024 fixed-to-fixed subordinated notes US$1,200 Enbridge Inc. August 2024 medium-term notes $1,800 Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC July 2024 senior notes US$350 East Tennessee Natural Gas, LLC December 2024 senior notes US$460 Questar Gas Company December 2024 senior notes US$200 82

Credit Facilities, Ratings and Liquidity To ensure ongoing liquidity and to mitigate the risk of capital market disruption, we maintain ready access to funds through committed bank credit facilities and actively manage our bank funding sources to optimize pricing and other terms. The following table provides details of our committed credit facilities, inclusive of term loans, at December 31, 2024: Maturity 1 Total Facilities Draws 2 Available (millions of Canadian dollars) Enbridge Inc. 2025-2049 8,840 5,843 2,997 Enbridge (U.S.) Inc. 2026-2029 10,813 4,707 6,106 Enbridge Pipelines Inc. 2026 2,000 509 1,491 Enbridge Gas Inc. 2026 2,500 530 1,970 Total committed credit facilities 24,153 11,589 12,564 1 Maturity date is inclusive of the one-year term out option for certain credit facilities. 2 Includes facility draws and commercial paper issuances that are back-stopped by credit facilities. In March 2024, we entered into a delayed-draw term loan facility in support of sustainable retrofit projects for large buildings using decarbonization solutions for $200 million which matures in March 2049. In June 2024, we entered into a five-year, non-revolving term loan facility of US$250 million which matures in June 2029. In July 2024, we renewed approximately $8.8 billion of our 364-day extendible credit facilities, extending the maturity dates to July 2026, which includes a one-year term out provision from July 2025. We also renewed approximately $7.8 billion of our five-year credit facilities, extending the maturity dates to July 2029. Further, we extended the maturity dates of our three-year credit facilities to July 2027. In July 2024, Enbridge Gas Ontario extended the maturity date of its 364-day extendible credit facility to July 2026, which includes a one-year term out provision from July 2025. In July 2024, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. extended the maturity date of its 364-day extendible credit facility to July 2026, which includes a one-year term out provision from July 2025. In January 2024 and October 2024, we entered into new letters of credit facilities and increased our letter of credit facilities by $146 million and $200 million, respectively. In addition to the committed credit facilities noted above, we maintain $1.4 billion of uncommitted demand letter of credit facilities, of which $931 million was unutilized as at December 31, 2024. As at December 31, 2023, we had $1.1 billion of uncommitted demand letter of credit facilities, of which $572 million was unutilized. As at December 31, 2024, our net available liquidity totaled $14.4 billion (2023 - $23.0 billion), consisting of available credit facilities of $12.6 billion (2023 - $17.1 billion) and unrestricted Cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion (2023 - $5.9 billion) as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Our credit facility agreements and term debt indentures include standard events of default and covenant provisions, whereby accelerated repayment and/or termination of the agreements may result if we were to default on payment or violate certain covenants. As at December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to continue to comply with such covenants. 83

Page 84
Cash flow growth, ready access to liquidity from diversified sources and a stable business model have enabled us to manage our credit profile. We actively monitor and manage key financial metrics with the objective of sustaining investment grade credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies and ongoing access to bank funding and term debt capital on attractive terms. Key measures of financial strength that are closely managed include the ability to service debt obligations from operating cash flow and the ratio of debt to EBITDA. Credit Ratings Action On March 29, 2024, Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) downgraded Enbridge's credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa2 from Baa1. Moody's also downgraded the credit ratings of our subsidiaries: Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (EEP), Enbridge Energy Limited Partnership, Spectra Energy Partners, LP (SEP) and Texas Eastern. The outlooks of all five entities were changed to stable from negative. In June 2024, Standard & Poor's Global revised Enbridge's and EEP's outlooks from negative to stable. On June 28, 2024, Morningstar DBRS (DBRS) upgraded Enbridge's credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt ratings to A (low) from BBB (high). DBRS also updated the credit rating of EEP to A (low) with a stable trend. There are no material restrictions on our cash. Total Restricted cash of $92 million, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily includes cash collateral and future pipeline abandonment costs collected and held in trust. Cash and cash equivalents held by certain subsidiaries may not be readily accessible for alternative use by us. Excluding current maturities of long-term debt, as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had negative and positive working capital positions of $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. In 2024, the major contributing factor to the negative working capital position was the current liabilities associated with our growth capital program compared to a positive working capital position in 2023, due to the increase in cash associated with pre-funding of the Acquisitions. SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Operating activities 12,600 14,201 11,230 Investing activities (20,363) (6,043) (5,270) Financing activities 3,544 (2,864) (5,428) Effect of translation of foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 234 (216) 55 Net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (3,985) 5,078 587 Significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 84

Page 85
Operating Activities Typically, the primary factors impacting cash provided by operating activities year-over-year include changes in our operating assets and liabilities in the normal course due to various factors, including the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices and activity levels on working capital within our business segments, the timing of tax payments, as well as timing of cash receipts and payments generally. Refer to Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 28. Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities is also impacted by changes in earnings and certain infrequent or other non-operating factors, as discussed under Results of Operations, as well as Distributions from equity investments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities primarily relates to capital expenditures to execute our capital program, which is further described in Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects . The timing of project approval, construction and in-service dates impacts the timing of cash requirements. Cash used in investing activities is also impacted by acquisitions and dispositions as discussed under Recent Developments, and changes in contributions to, and distributions from, our equity investments. A summary of cash additions to property, plant and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is set out below: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Liquids Pipelines 1,157 1,158 1,418 Gas Transmission 2,453 1,890 1,647 Gas Distribution and Storage 2,381 1,451 1,499 Renewable Power Generation 661 100 50 Eliminations and Other 59 55 33 Total capital expenditures 6,711 4,654 4,647 2024 The increase in cash used in investing activities primarily resulted from the following factors: • the acquisitions of EOG, Questar, PSNC, and Tomorrow RNG in 2024; • increased capital expenditures from the acquisitions of EOG, Questar, and PSNC and from growth projects in our Gas Transmission segment; and • the acquisition of an equity interest in the Whistler Parent JV and Delaware Basin Residue, LLC and contributions to our Fox Squirrel Solar investment in 2024. The factors above were partially offset by proceeds received from the dispositions of our interests in the Alliance Pipeline, Aux Sable, and NRGreen in 2024. 2023 The increase in cash used in investing activities primarily resulted from the following factors: • the absence in 2023 of the proceeds received from the completion of a joint venture merger transaction for DCP Midstream, LLC in August 2022; and • higher cash outflows related to acquisitions in 2023 when compared to 2022. The factors above were partially offset by higher distributions in 2023 mainly related to our investment in NEXUS Gas Transmission, LLC. 85

Page 86
Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to issuances and repayments of external debt, as well as transactions with our common and preference shareholders relating to dividends, share issuances, share redemptions and common share repurchases under our NCIB. Cash provided by financing activities is also impacted by changes in distributions to, and contributions from, noncontrolling interests. 2024 The increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the following factors: • net commercial paper and credit facility draws in 2024 when compared to net repayments during the same period in 2023; • the ATM program, resulting in the issuance of 51,298,629 common shares for aggregate net proceeds of $2.5 billion in 2024; and • lower net repayments of short-term borrowings in 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The factors above were partially offset by: • higher long-term debt repayments and lower long-term debt issuances in 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023; • the absence in 2024 of the public offering of common shares, which closed on September 8, 2023 for gross proceeds of $4.6 billion; and • increased common share dividend payments primarily due to the increase in our common share dividend rate and an increase in the number of common shares outstanding. 2023 The decrease in cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the following factors: • higher long-term debt issuances in 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022; • our public offering of common shares, which closed on September 8, 2023, resulting in the issuance of 102,913,500 common shares at a price of $44.70 per share for gross proceeds of $4.6 billion, which is intended to finance a portion of the aggregate cash consideration payable for the Acquisitions; and • the absence in 2023 of the redemption of Preference Shares, Series 17 and Series J in the first and second quarters of 2022, respectively. The factors above were partially offset by: • higher net commercial paper and credit facility repayments in 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022; • net repayments of short-term borrowings in 2023 when compared to net issuances in 2022; • the absence in 2023 of proceeds received from the sale of a non-operating interest in seven pipelines from our Regional Oil Sands System in October 2022; • higher long-term debt repayments in 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022; and • increased common share dividend payments primarily due to the increase in our common share dividend rate and an increase in the number of common shares outstanding. 86

With the exception of Preference Shares, Series A, such fixed dividend rate resets every five years beginning on the initial Redemption and Conversion Option Date. Preference Shares, Series G, Series I and Series 4 contain a feature where the dividend rate resets on a quarterly basis. These Dividend Rates are presented in the table above on an annualized basis using the most recent quarterly dividend rate reset. The Preference Shares, Series 19 contain a feature where the fixed dividend rate, when reset every five years, will not be less than 4.90%. No other series of preference shares has this feature. 2 Preference Shares, Series A may be redeemed any time at our option. For all other series of preference shares, we may at our option, redeem all or a portion of the outstanding preference shares for the Per Share Base Redemption Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Redemption Option Date and on every fifth anniversary thereafter. 3 The holder will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to convert their shares into Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares of a specified series on a one-for-one basis on the Conversion Option Date and every fifth anniversary thereafter at an ascribed issue price equal to the Per Share Base Redemption Value. 87

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION On January 22, 2019, Enbridge entered into supplemental indentures with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SEP and EEP (the Partnerships), pursuant to which Enbridge fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, the payment obligations of the Partnerships with respect to the outstanding series of notes issued under the respective indentures of the Partnerships. Concurrently, the Partnerships entered into a subsidiary guarantee agreement pursuant to which they fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, the outstanding series of senior notes of Enbridge. The Partnerships have also entered into supplemental indentures with Enbridge pursuant to which the Partnerships have issued full and unconditional guarantees, on a senior unsecured basis, of senior notes issued by Enbridge subsequent to January 22, 2019. As a result of the guarantees, holders of any of the outstanding guaranteed notes of the Partnerships (the Guaranteed Partnership Notes) are in the same position with respect to the net assets, income and cash flows of Enbridge as holders of Enbridge's outstanding guaranteed notes (the Guaranteed Enbridge Notes), and vice versa. Other than the Partnerships, Enbridge subsidiaries (including the subsidiaries of the Partnerships, collectively, the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors), are not parties to the subsidiary guarantee agreement and have not otherwise guaranteed any of Enbridge's outstanding series of senior notes.

Rule 3-10 of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation S-X provides an exemption from the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended (the Exchange Act) for fully consolidated subsidiary issuers of guaranteed securities and subsidiary guarantors and allows for summarized financial information in lieu of filing separate financial statements for each of the Partnerships. The following Summarized Combined Statement of Earnings and the Summarized Combined Statements of Financial Position combines the balances of EEP, SEP and Enbridge. Summarized Combined Statement of Earnings Year ended December 31, 2024 (millions of Canadian dollars) Operating loss (99) Loss (389) Loss attributable to common shareholders (777) 91

Summarized Combined Statements of Financial Position December 31, 2024 2023 (millions of Canadian dollars) Cash and cash equivalents 2,000 6,525 Accounts receivable from affiliates 3,901 3,440 Short-term loans receivable from affiliates 3,892 3,291 Other current assets 499 491 Long-term loans receivable from affiliates 54,416 45,702 Other long-term assets 2,139 3,303 Accounts payable to affiliates 2,252 2,264 Short-term loans payable to affiliates 1,188 807 Trade payable and accrued liabilities 661 743 Other current liabilities 8,047 7,256 Long-term loans payable to affiliates 36,576 35,556 Other long-term liabilities 62,642 52,096 The Guaranteed Enbridge Notes and the Guaranteed Partnership Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors in respect of the assets of those Subsidiary Non- Guarantors. Under US bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a guarantee can be voided, or claims may be subordinated to all other debts of that guarantor if, among other things, the guarantor, at the time the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee or, in some states, when payments become due under the guarantee: • received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the guarantee and was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; • was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or • intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature. The guarantees of the Guaranteed Enbridge Notes contain provisions to limit the maximum amount of liability that the Partnerships could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under the guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under US federal or state law. Each of the Partnerships is entitled to a right of contribution from the other Partnership for 50% of all payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Partnership in discharging its obligations under the guarantees for the Guaranteed Enbridge Notes. 92

Page 93
Under the terms of the guarantee agreement and applicable supplemental indentures, the guarantees of either of the Partnerships of any Guaranteed Enbridge Notes will be unconditionally released and discharged automatically upon the occurrence of any of the following events: • any direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer, whether by way of merger, sale or transfer of equity interests or otherwise, to any person that is not an affiliate of Enbridge, of any of Enbridge’s direct or indirect limited partnership of other equity interests in that Partnership as a result of which the Partnership ceases to be a consolidated subsidiary of Enbridge; • the merger of that Partnership into Enbridge or the other Partnership or the liquidation and dissolution of that Partnership; • the repayment in full or discharge or defeasance of those Guaranteed Enbridge Notes, as contemplated by the applicable indenture or guarantee agreement; • with respect to EEP, the repayment in full or discharge or defeasance of each of the consenting EEP notes listed above; • with respect to SEP, the repayment in full or discharge or defeasance of each of the consenting SEP notes listed above; or • with respect to any series of Guaranteed Enbridge Notes, with the consent of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of that series of Guaranteed Enbridge Notes. The guarantee obligations of Enbridge will terminate with respect to any series of Guaranteed Partnership Notes if that series is discharged or defeased. The Partnerships also guarantee the obligations of Enbridge under its existing credit facilities . LEGAL AND OTHER UPDATES LINE 5 EASEMENT (BAD RIVER BAND) On July 23, 2019, the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (the Band) filed a complaint in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin (the Court) over our Line 5 pipeline and right-of-way across the Bad River Reservation (the Reservation). Only a small portion of the total easements across 12 miles of the Reservation are at issue. The Band alleges that our continued use of Line 5 to transport crude oil and related liquids across the Reservation is a public nuisance under federal and state law and that the pipeline is in trespass on certain tracts of land in which the Band possesses ownership interests. The complaint seeks an Order prohibiting us from using Line 5 to transport crude oil and related liquids across the Reservation and requiring removal of the pipeline from the Reservation. Subsequently amended versions of the complaint also seek recovery of profits-based damages based on an unjust enrichment theory. Enbridge has responded to each claim in the initial and amended complaints with an answer, defenses and counterclaims. On August 29, 2022, the Government of Canada released a statement formally invoking the dispute settlement provisions of the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty in respect of this litigation, reiterating its concerns about the uninterrupted transmission of hydrocarbons through Line 5. On September 7, 2022, the Court issued a decision on cross-motions for summary judgment. The Court determined that the Band's nuisance claim raised factual issues that could not be resolved on summary judgment. The Court further determined that Enbridge is in trespass on 12 parcels on the Reservation and that the Band is entitled to some measure of profits-based damages and to an injunction, with the level of damages and scope of the injunction to be determined at trial, which occurred October 24 through November 1, 2022. On May 9, 2023, the Band filed an Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief asking the Court to require Enbridge to purge and shutdown Line 5 on the Reservation due to significant erosion at the Meander. Enbridge responded and a hearing was held on May 18, 2023 in front of Judge Conley who indicated that he did not find the Band had proven imminence but that his final ruling on all issues would be provided soon. 93

Page 94
On June 26, 2023, the Court issued its Final Order ruling as follows: (1) Enbridge shall adopt and implement its 2022 Monitoring and Shutdown Plan with the Court's modifications by July 5, 2023; (2) Enbridge owes the Band $5,151,668 for past trespass on the 12 allotted parcels; (3) Enbridge must continue to pay money on a quarterly basis using the formula set in its Order as long as Line 5 operates in trespass on the 12 allotted parcels (approximately $400,000 per year); (4) Enbridge must cease operation of Line 5 on any parcel within the Band's tribal territory without a valid right of way by June 16, 2026 and thereafter arrange prompt, reasonable remediation at those sites; and (5) The Court declined to allow for the Relocation to be completed prior to having to cease operations. The Final Judgment was entered on June 29, 2023. Enbridge filed its Notice of Appeal on June 30, 2023 and the Band filed its Notice of Cross Appeal on July 27, 2023. On December 12, 2023, the 7 th Circuit requested the US to file a brief in this appeal as amicus curiae to address the effect of the Agreement Between the US and Canada Concerning Transit Pipelines, 28 U.S.T. 7449 (1977), and any other issues that the US believes to be material. Subsequently, the US filed its brief on April 8, 2024. As invited by the Court of Appeals, Enbridge and the Band filed their respective responses to the US amicus brief on April 29, 2024. We anticipate the Court of Appeals will issue a decision in early 2025. MICHIGAN LINE 5 DUAL PIPELINES - STRAITS OF MACKINAC EASEMENT Michigan Attorney General Lawsuit In 2019, the Michigan Attorney General (AG) filed a complaint in the Michigan Ingham County Circuit Court (the Circuit Court) that requests the Circuit Court to declare the easement granted to Enbridge in 1953 for the operation of Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac (the Straits) to be invalid and to prohibit continued operation of Line 5 in the Straits. On December 15, 2021, Enbridge removed the case to the US District Court in the Western District of Michigan (US District Court). The removal of the AG's case to federal court followed a November 16, 2021 ruling which held that the similar (and now dismissed) 2020 lawsuit brought by the Governor of Michigan to force Line 5's shutdown raised important federal issues that should be heard in federal court. The AG subsequently filed various motions and appeals (opposed by Enbridge) to remand the case. On June 17, 2024, the 6 th Circuit Court of Appeals (6 th Circuit) overturned the US District Court’s decision and remanded the AG's lawsuit against Enbridge back to the Circuit Court. On July 15, 2024, Enbridge filed a petition for rehearing, which was denied on August 16, 2024. Briefing by both parties was concluded on December 23, 2024. Oral argument took place before the Circuit Court judge on January 27, 2025, on cross motions for summary disposition which have been pending for almost four years. We anticipate a decision on the motions for summary disposition in 2025. On January 13, 2025, Enbridge filed a petition for certiorari with the US Supreme Court. The petition asks the Supreme Court to review and reverse the June 2024 decision of the 6th Circuit remanding to state court the Michigan Attorney General’s lawsuit against Enbridge seeking to shut down Line 5. Enbridge Lawsuit On November 24, 2020, Enbridge filed in the US District Court a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief requesting that the US District Court enjoin the State of Michigan Officials from taking any action to prevent or impede the operation of Line 5. The Government of Canada has filed a supplemental brief reiterating that the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty between the US and Canada has been invoked and that the matter is of great importance to Canada. This matter remains in federal court. 94

Page 95
In January 2022, the State of Michigan Officials filed a motion to dismiss Enbridge's Complaint and Enbridge filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 5, 2024, the US District Court issued an Order denying the Michigan officials' motion to dismiss Enbridge's Complaint, and the State of Michigan Officials filed for an immediate appeal to the 6 th Circuit. On August 29, 2024, the US District Court issued an order staying the case, pending the 6 th Circuit’s decision. Briefing on the appeal concluded on December 20, 2024; oral argument is scheduled for March 18, 2025, with an expected decision in 2025. DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE We own an effective interest of 27.6% in the Bakken Pipeline System, which is inclusive of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed lawsuits in 2016 with the US Court for the District of Columbia (the District Court) contesting the lawfulness of the Army Corps easement for DAPL, including the adequacy of the Army Corps' environmental review and tribal consultation process. The Oglala Sioux and Yankton Sioux Tribes also filed lawsuits alleging similar claims in 2018. On June 14, 2017, the District Court found the Army Corps' environmental review to be deficient and ordered the Army Corps to conduct further study concerning spill risks from DAPL. On March 25, 2020, in response to amended complaints from the Tribes, the District Court found that the Army Corps' subsequent environmental review completed in August 2018 was also deficient and ordered the Army Corps to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to address unresolved controversy pertaining to potential spill impacts resulting from DAPL. On July 6, 2020, the District Court issued an order vacating the Army Corps' easement for DAPL and ordering that the pipeline be shut down by August 5, 2020. On that day, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the District Court's July 6 order to shut down and empty the pipeline. On January 26, 2021, the US Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision, holding that the Army Corps is required to prepare an EIS and that the Army Corps' easement for DAPL is vacated. The US Supreme Court subsequently denied the request of Dakota Access, LLC to review the decision that an EIS is required. The US Court of Appeals also determined that, absent an injunction proceeding, the District Court could not order DAPL's operations to cease. While not an issue before, the US Court of Appeals also recognized that the Army Corps could consider whether to allow DAPL to continue to operate in the absence of an easement. The Army Corps earlier indicated that it did not intend to exercise its authority to bar DAPL's continued operation, notwithstanding the absence of an easement. On September 8, 2023, the Army Corps issued its draft EIS, which assesses the impacts of DAPL under five alternative scenarios: denying the easement removing the pipeline; denying the easement and leaving the pipeline in place; granting the easement with the prior conditions (which allow for the ongoing operation, maintenance and ultimate removal of the pipeline and its related facilities); granting the easement with some new safety conditions; and rerouting the pipeline. The Army Corps did not identify a preferred alternative. The public comment period that commenced on the issuance of the draft EIS closed on December 13, 2023. The pipeline will remain operational while the environmental review process continues. The final EIS is expected to be issued in 2025. 95

Page 96
On October 15, 2024, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a complaint in the DC District Court against the Army Corps, among others, seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting the continued operation of DAPL. The main allegations of the complaint are that the Army Corps is unlawfully permitting DAPL to continue to operate without an easement and without a determination under the National Environmental Policy Act, and that the Army Corps has failed to require that a compliant Facility Response Plan be submitted. Several of the claims are similar to those in the litigation described above. Dakota Access, LLC and 13 states have intervened in the case in support of the Army Corps and continued operation of DAPL. Dakota Access, LLC filed an answer to the complaint on December 19, 2024. On January 17, 2025, the Federal Defendants, Dakota Access LLC, and the 13 States filed motions to dismiss the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s complaint. Also on January 17, 2025, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion for partial summary judgment on its claims. We expect that these recent motions will require additional briefing in 2025. OTHER LITIGATION We and our subsidiaries are subject to various other legal and regulatory actions and proceedings which arise in the normal course of business, including interventions in regulatory proceedings and challenges to regulatory approvals and permits. While the final outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of such actions and proceedings will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. TAX MATTERS We and our subsidiaries maintain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. While fully supportable in our view, these tax positions, if challenged by tax authorities, may not be fully sustained on review. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In making judgments and estimates, management relies on external information and observable conditions, where possible, supplemented by internal analysis as required. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below have an impact across the various segments of our business. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our business acquisitions. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values as at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, as well as any contingent consideration, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, or the final determination of values for assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Accounting for business combinations requires significant judgment, estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date. In developing estimates of fair values at the acquisition date, we utilize a variety of factors including market data, historical and future expected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The subjective nature of our assumptions increases the risk associated with estimates surrounding the projected performance of the acquired entity. 96

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets upon acquisition of a business. The carrying value of goodwill, which is not amortized, is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. We perform our annual review of the goodwill balance on April 1. We perform our annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components, and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. Our reporting units are Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Renewable Power Generation. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. When performing a qualitative assessment, we determine the drivers of fair value for each reporting unit and evaluate whether those drivers have been positively or negatively affected by relevant events and circumstances since the last fair value assessment. Our evaluation includes, but is not limited to, the assessment of macroeconomic trends (including the impact of changes in discount rates and rate base multiple), changes to regulatory environments, capital accessibility, operating income trends (including changes to projected cash flows from operations, expected future capital expenditures and forecasted rate base), and changes to industry conditions. Based on our assessment of qualitative factors, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment is performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment assessment involves determining the fair value of our reporting units and comparing those values to the carrying value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. This amount should not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow technique requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, projected operating income, expected future capital expenditures and working capital levels, as well as terminal value growth rates for the Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, and Renewable Power Generation reporting units, and projected regulatory rate base and rate base multiple for the Gas Distribution and Storage reporting unit. The allocation of goodwill to held-for-sale and disposed businesses is based on the relative fair value of businesses included in the relevant reporting unit. On April 1, 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment which consisted of a qualitative assessment for the Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Renewable Power Generation reporting units and did not identify impairment indicators. No indicators of goodwill impairment were identified during the remainder of 2024. ASSET IMPAIRMENT We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment when events or circumstances, such as economic obsolescence, business climate, legal or regulatory changes, or other factors, indicate that we may not recover the carrying amount of our assets. We regularly monitor our businesses, the market and business environments to identify indicators that could suggest an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its expected undiscounted cash flows, we will assess the fair value of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 97

Page 98
With respect to equity method investments, we assess at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired by completing a qualitative or quantitative analysis of factors impacting the investment. If there is objective evidence of impairment, we determine whether the decline below carrying value is other-than-temporary. If the decline is determined to be other-than- temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in earnings with an offsetting reduction to the carrying value of the investment. Asset fair value is determined using present value techniques. The determination of fair value using present value techniques requires the use of projections and assumptions regarding future cash flows and weighted average cost of capital. Any changes to these projections and assumptions could result in revisions to the evaluation of the recoverability of the asset and the recognition of an impairment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE We classify assets as held for sale when management commits to a formal plan to actively market an asset or a group of assets and when management believes it is probable the sale of the assets will occur within one year. We measure assets classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying value and their estimated fair value less costs to sell. REGULATORY ACCOUNTING Certain parts of our businesses are subject to regulation by various authorities including, but not limited to, the CER, the FERC, the Alberta Energy Regulator, the BC Energy Regulator, the OEB, the Québec Régie de l’énergie, the Ohio Commission, the North Carolina Commission, the Utah Commission, the Wyoming Commission, and the Idaho Commission. Regulatory bodies exercise statutory authority over matters such as construction, rates and ratemaking, and agreements with customers. To recognize the economic effects of the actions of the regulator, the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses in these operations may differ from that otherwise expected under US GAAP for non-rate- regulated entities. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are: • costs of providing service, including operating costs, capital invested, depreciation expense and taxes; • allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes; • interest costs on the debt component of the capital structure; and • contract and volume throughput assumptions. The allowed rate of return is determined in accordance with the applicable regulatory model and may impact our profitability. The rates for a number of our projects are based on a cost-of-service recovery model that follows the regulators' authoritative guidance. Under the cost-of-service tolling methodology, we calculate tolls based on forecast volumes and cost. A difference between forecast and actual results causes an over- or under-recovery in any given year. Regulatory assets represent amounts that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates, amounts collected from customers in advance of costs being incurred, or to be paid to cover future abandonment costs and for future removal and site restoration costs as approved by the regulator. If there are changes in our assessment of the probability of recovery for a regulatory asset, we reduce its carrying amount to the balance that we expect to recover from customers in future periods through rates. If a regulator later excludes from allowable costs all or a part of costs that were capitalized as a regulatory asset, we reduce the carrying amount of the asset by the excluded amounts. 98

Page 99
The recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities is based on the actions, or expected future actions, of the regulator. To the extent that the regulator's actions differ from our expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or settlement of regulatory balances could differ significantly from those recorded. In the absence of rate regulation, we would generally not recognize regulatory assets or liabilities and the earnings impact would be recorded in the period the expenses are incurred or revenues are earned. A regulatory asset or liability is recognized in respect of deferred income taxes when it is expected the amounts will be recovered or settled through future regulator-approved rates. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Southern Lights Pipeline completed an open season to negotiate new transportation service agreements. We did not renew the agreements under a cost-of-service toll methodology, therefore Southern Lights Pipeline was no longer subject to rate-regulated accounting. As a result, the related regulatory liabilities, regulatory tax assets and associated regulatory deferred tax liabilities were derecognized in 2023. As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our regulatory assets totaled $7.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and regulatory liabilities totaled $6.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. DEPRECIATION Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, our largest asset with a net book value at December 31, 2024 and 2023, of $131.1 billion and $104.6 billion, respectively, is charged in accordance with two primary methods. For distinct assets, depreciation is generally provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset commencing when it is placed in service. For largely homogeneous groups of assets with comparable useful lives, the pool method of accounting is followed whereby similar assets are grouped and depreciated as a pool. When group assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains and losses are generally not reflected in earnings but are booked as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation. When it is determined that the estimated service life of an asset no longer reflects the expected remaining period of benefit, prospective changes are made to the estimated service life. Estimates of useful lives are based on third-party engineering studies, experience and/or industry practice. There are a number of assumptions inherent in estimating the service lives of our assets including the level of development, exploration, drilling, reserves and production of crude oil and natural gas in the supply areas served by our pipelines, as well as the demand for crude oil and natural gas and the integrity of our systems. Changes in these assumptions could result in adjustments to the estimated service lives, which could result in material changes to depreciation expense in future periods in any of our business segments. For certain rate-regulated operations, depreciation rates are approved by the regulator and the regulator may require periodic studies or technical updates on useful lives which may change depreciation rates. The successful efforts method of accounting is used for cost-of-service reserves developed and produced by Wexpro for gas utility affiliate, Questar. Cost-of-service reserves are properties for which the operations and return on investment are subject to the Wexpro Agreements. Under the successful efforts method, Wexpro capitalizes the costs of acquiring leaseholds, drilling development wells, drilling successful exploratory wells, and purchasing related support equipment and facilities. Geological and geophysical studies are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs of development wells and leaseholds are amortized on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method and the estimated proved developed or total proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. 99

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS We use certain assumptions relating to the calculation of defined benefit pension and other postretirement liabilities and net periodic benefit costs. These assumptions comprise management's best estimates of expected return on plan assets, future salary levels, other cost escalations, retirement ages of employees, and other actuarial factors including discount rates and mortality. We determine discount rates by reference to rates of high-quality long-term corporate bonds with maturities that approximate the timing of future payments anticipated to be made under each of the respective plans. The expected return on plan assets is determined using market-related values and assumptions on the asset mix consistent with the investment policy relating to the assets and their projected returns. The assumptions are reviewed annually by our independent actuaries. Actual results that differ from results based on assumptions are amortized over future periods and, therefore, could materially affect the expense recognized and the recorded obligation in future periods. The following sensitivity analysis identifies the impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 of a 0.5% change in key pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligation assumptions: Canada United States Obligation Expense Obligation Expense (millions of Canadian dollars) Pension Decrease in discount rate 296 16 94 7 Decrease in expected return on assets — 22 — 9 Decrease in rate of salary increase (59) (10) (20) (2) OPEB Decrease in discount rate 14 1 8 — Decrease in expected return on assets N/A N/A — 1 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Provisions for claims filed against us are determined on a case-by-case basis. Case estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new information is received. The process of evaluating claims involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment. Claims outstanding, the final determination of which could have a material impact on our financial results and certain subsidiaries and investments, are detailed in Legal and Other Updates and Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 30. Commitments and Contingencies . In addition, any unasserted claims that later may become evident could have a material impact on our financial results and certain subsidiaries and investments. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Asset retirement obligations (ARO) associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are measured at fair value and recognized as Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities in the period in which they can be reasonably determined. Fair value approximates the cost a third party would charge to perform the tasks necessary to retire such assets and is recognized at the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 ranged from 1.5% to 9.0%. ARO is added to the carrying value of the associated asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The corresponding liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings and is reduced by actual costs of decommissioning and reclamation. Our estimates of retirement costs could change as a result of changes in cost estimates and regulatory requirements. Currently, for the majority of our assets, there is insufficient data or information to reasonably determine the timing of settlement for estimating the fair value of the ARO. In these cases, the fair value of ARO is considered indeterminate for accounting purposes, as there is no data or information that can be derived from past practice, industry practice or the estimated economic life of the asset. 100

In 2009, the CER issued a decision related to the Land Matters Consultation Initiative (LMCI), which required holders of an authorization to operate a pipeline under the CER Act to file a proposed process and mechanism to set aside funds to pay for future abandonment costs in respect of the sites in Canada used for the operation of a pipeline. The CER's decision stated that, while pipeline companies are ultimately responsible for the full costs of abandoning pipelines, abandonment costs are a legitimate cost of providing service and are recoverable from the users of the pipeline upon approval by the CER. Following the CER's final approval of the collection mechanism and the set-aside mechanism for LMCI, we began collecting and setting aside funds to cover future abandonment costs effective January 1, 2015. The funds collected are held in trusts in accordance with the CER decision. The funds collected from shippers are reported within Transportation and other services revenues and Restricted long-term investments and cash. Concurrently, we reflect the future abandonment cost as an increase to Operating and administrative expense and Other long-term liabilities. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES Refer to Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. Changes in Accounting Policies . ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows and other comprehensive income (OCI) are subject to movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and our share price. The following summarizes the types of market risks to which we are exposed and the risk management instruments used to mitigate them. We use a combination of qualifying and non-qualifying derivative instruments to manage the risks noted below. Foreign Exchange Risk We generate certain revenues, incur expenses and hold a number of investments and subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than Canadian dollars. As a result, our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variability. We employ financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency-denominated earnings exposure. A combination of qualifying and non-qualifying derivative instruments is used to hedge anticipated foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses and to manage variability in cash flows. We hedge certain net investments in US dollar-denominated investments and subsidiaries using US dollar-denominated debt. Interest Rate Risk Our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to short-term interest rate variability due to the regular repricing of our variable rate debt, primarily commercial paper. We have a policy of limiting the maximum floating rate debt to 30% of total debt outstanding. To ensure compliance with our policy, we monitor and adjust our debt portfolio mix of fixed and variable rate debt instruments in conjunction with the use of hedging instruments. We have implemented a hedging program to partially mitigate the impact of short- term interest rate volatility on interest expense via the execution of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps and costless collars. These swaps have an average fixed rate of 3.6%. 101

Page 102
Our earnings and cash flows are also exposed to variability in longer term interest rates ahead of anticipated fixed rate term debt issuances. A combination of qualifying and non-qualifying forward starting interest rate swaps are used to hedge against the effect of future interest rate movements. We have established a program including some of our subsidiaries to partially mitigate our exposure to long-term interest rate variability on forecasted term debt issuances via execution of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps with an average swap rate of 3.4%. Commodity Price Risk Our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to changes in commodity prices as a result of our ownership interests in certain assets and investments, as well as through the activities of our energy marketing subsidiaries. These commodities include natural gas, crude oil, power and NGL. We employ financial and physical derivative instruments to fix a portion of the variable price exposures that arise from physical transactions involving these commodities. We use primarily non-qualifying derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk. Equity Price Risk Equity price risk is the risk of earnings fluctuations due to changes in our share price. We have exposure to our own common share price through the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation, which affect earnings through the revaluation of outstanding units every period. Market Risk Management We have a Risk Policy to minimize the likelihood that adverse cash flow impacts arising from movements in market prices will exceed a defined risk tolerance. We identify and measure all material market risks including commodity price risks, interest rate risks, foreign exchange risk and equity price risk using a standardized measurement methodology. Our market risk metric consolidates the exposure after accounting for the impact of offsetting risks and limits the consolidated cash flow volatility arising from market related risks to an acceptable approved risk tolerance threshold. Our market risk metric is Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR). CFaR is a statistically derived measurement used to measure the maximum cash flow loss that could potentially result from adverse market price movements over a one month holding period for price sensitive non-derivative exposures and for derivative instruments we hold or issue as recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as at December 31, 2024. CFaR assumes that no further mitigating actions are taken to hedge or otherwise minimize exposures and the selection of a one month holding period reflects the mix of price risk sensitive assets at Enbridge. As a practical matter, a large portion of Enbridge’s exposure could be hedged or unwound in a much shorter period if required to mitigate the risks. The consolidated CFaR policy limit for Enbridge is 3.5% of its forward 12 month normalized cash flow. At December 31, 2024 and 2023 CFaR was $113 million and $100 million or 0.9% and 0.9%, respectively, of estimated 12 month forward normalized cash flow. 102

Page 103
LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations, including commitments and guarantees, as they become due. In order to mitigate this risk, we forecast cash requirements over a 12 month rolling time period to determine whether sufficient funds will be available. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are funds generated from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and draws under committed credit facilities and long-term debt, which includes debentures and medium- term notes. Our shelf prospectuses with securities regulators enable ready access to either the Canadian or US public capital markets, subject to market conditions. In addition, we maintain sufficient liquidity through committed credit facilities with a diversified group of banks and institutions which, if necessary, enables us to fund all anticipated requirements for approximately one year without accessing the capital markets. We were in compliance with all the terms and conditions of our committed credit facility agreements and term debt indentures as at December 31, 2024. As a result, all credit facilities are available to us and the banks are obligated to fund us under the terms of the facilities. We also identify other potential sources of debt and equity funding alternatives, including reinstatement of our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan or at-the-market equity issuances. CREDIT RISK Entering into derivative instruments may result in exposure to credit risk from the possibility that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, we enter into risk management transactions primarily with institutions that possess strong investment grade credit ratings. Credit risk relating to derivative counterparties is mitigated through the maintenance and monitoring of credit exposure limits, contractual requirements and netting arrangements. We also review counterparty credit exposure using external credit rating services and other analytical tools to manage credit risk. We have a policy of entering into individual International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. agreements, or other similar derivative agreements, with the majority of our derivative counterparties. These agreements provide for the net settlement of derivative instruments outstanding with specific counterparties in the event of bankruptcy or other significant credit events and reduce our credit risk exposure on financial derivative asset positions in those circumstances. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include derivatives and other financial instruments. We also disclose the fair value of other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The fair value of financial instruments reflects our best estimates of market value based on generally accepted valuation techniques or models and is supported by observable market prices and rates. When such values are not available, we use discounted cash flow analysis from applicable yield curves based on observable market inputs to estimate fair value. 103

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Enbridge Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Enbridge Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control ‒ Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control ‒ Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Page 106
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The East Ohio Gas Company, Questar Gas Company and its related Wexpro entities, and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because they were acquired separately by the Company in business combinations during 2024. We have also excluded The East Ohio Gas Company, Questar Gas Company and its related Wexpro entities, and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The East Ohio Gas Company, Questar Gas Company and its related Wexpro entities, and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 11% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for the Gas Transmission (GT) and Gas Distribution and Storage (GDS) reporting units As described in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $36,600 million as at December 31, 2024 which includes goodwill balances of $18,278 million and $8,892 million related to the GT and GDS reporting units respectively. An annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed at the reporting unit level as of April 1 of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Management has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. When performing a qualitative assessment, management determines the drivers of fair value for each reporting unit and evaluates whether those drivers have been positively or negatively affected by relevant events and circumstances since the last fair value assessment. Management’s evaluation includes, but is not limited to, the assessment of macroeconomic trends (including the impact of changes in discount rates and rate base multiple), changes to regulatory environments, capital accessibility, operating income trends (including changes to projected cash flows from operations, expected future capital expenditures and forecasted rate base), and changes to industry conditions. Based on management’s assessment of qualitative factors, if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment is performed. Management performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of April 1, 2024 and did not identify impairment indicators for the GT and GDS reporting units. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for the GT and GDS reporting units is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments required by management in assessing the drivers of fair value in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for the GT and GDS reporting units to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is required. This led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures related to management’s assessment of drivers of fair value in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for the GT and GDS reporting units with respect to changes to projected cash flows from operations and expected future capital expenditures as well as the impact of changes in discount rate for the GT reporting unit and changes to rate base multiple and forecasted rate base for the GDS reporting unit. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment. These

Page 108
procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for the GT and GDS reporting units by assessing the reasonableness of changes to (i) projected cash flows from operations and expected future capital expenditures for the GT reporting unit and (ii) the forecasted rate base for the GDS reporting unit by considering the current and past performance of the GT and GDS reporting units, external industry data, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for the GT and GDS reporting units, by assessing the reasonableness of the impact of changes in (i) discount rate for the GT reporting unit and (ii) the rate base multiple for the GDS reporting unit.

1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW The terms "we", "our", "us" and "Enbridge" as used in this report refer collectively to Enbridge Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise. These terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any separate legal entity within Enbridge. Effective January 1, 2024, to better align how the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews operating performance and resource allocation across operating segments, we transferred our Canadian and United States (US) crude oil marketing businesses from the Energy Services segment to the Liquids Pipelines segment. As a result, the Energy Services segment ceased to exist and the remainder of the business, comprising natural gas and power marketing, is now reported in Eliminations and Other. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, prior period comparable results for segmented information have been recast to reflect the change in reportable segments. This segment reporting change does not have an impact on our consolidated results. Enbridge is a publicly traded energy transportation and distribution company. We conduct our business through four business segments: Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Renewable Power Generation. These reporting segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long-term objectives, to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance. LIQUIDS PIPELINES Liquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport and export various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons, including the Mainline System, Regional Oil Sands System, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent, and Other. Effective January 1, 2024, our Canadian and US crude oil marketing businesses are included in this segment. These businesses provide energy marketing services to customers and undertake physical commodity marketing activity and logistical services to manage our volume commitments on various pipeline systems. GAS TRANSMISSION Gas Transmission consists of our investments in natural gas pipelines and gathering and processing facilities in Canada and the US, including US Gas Transmission, Canadian Gas Transmission, US Midstream, and Other. This segment also includes certain investments in renewable natural gas (RNG) facilities. On January 2, 2024, we acquired six Morrow Renewables operating landfill gas-to-RNG production facilities (Tomorrow RNG) located in Texas and Arkansas which are a component of Other within the Gas Transmission segment (Note 8) . We also sold our interests in the Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable (including a 42.7% interest in Aux Sable Midstream LLC and Aux Sable Liquid Products L.P., and a 50.0% interest in Aux Sable Canada LP), previously reported in the Gas Transmission segment, to Pembina Pipeline Corporation on April 1, 2024 (Note 13) . GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE Gas Distribution and Storage consists of our rate-regulated natural gas utility operations in Canada and the US. Enbridge Gas Inc. (Enbridge Gas Ontario) serves residential, commercial and industrial customers across Ontario. In 2024, we acquired three US natural gas utilities, The East Ohio Gas Company (EOG), Questar Gas Company (Questar) and its related Wexpro companies (Wexpro), and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated (PSNC), which make up our US gas utilities (Note 8) . This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Québec. 115

Page 116
RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION Renewable Power Generation consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as equity interests in geothermal power and power transmission assets. In North America, assets are primarily located in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Québec, and in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. We also hold interests in offshore wind facilities in operation, under construction and in active development in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. This segment also includes Tri Global Energy, LLC (TGE) which was acquired on September 27, 2022 (Note 8) . ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER In addition to the segments described above, Eliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs that are not allocated to business segments, the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements and the activities of our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. The principal activity of our captive insurance subsidiaries is providing insurance and reinsurance coverage for certain insurable property and casualty risk exposures of our operating subsidiaries and certain equity investments. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and corporate investments. Effective January 1, 2024, our natural gas and power marketing businesses are also included in Eliminations and Other. Enbridge's CODM is the President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), disaggregated by line of business, to assess segment performance and to set targets predominantly in the annual and long-term budgeting and forecasting process. Budget-to-actual and actual-to-actual variances in EBITDA are considered when making decisions about the allocation of resources to the segments and to meet our strategic priorities. Refer to Note 5 - Segmented Information for a reconciliation of EBITDA to earnings before income taxes. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). Amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. As a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrant, we are permitted to use US GAAP for the purposes of meeting both our Canadian and US continuous disclosure requirements. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to: variable consideration included in revenue (Note 4) ; carrying values of regulatory assets and liabilities (Note 7) ; purchase price allocations (Note 8) ; unbilled revenues; expected credit losses; depreciation rates and carrying value of property, plant and equipment (Note 11) ; amortization rates and carrying value of intangible assets (Note 14) ; measurement of goodwill (Note 15) ; fair value of asset retirement obligations (ARO) (Note 18) ; valuation of stock-based compensation (Note 21) ; fair value of financial instruments (Note 23) ; provisions for income taxes (Note 24) ; assumptions used to measure retirement benefits and OPEB (Note 25) ; commitments and contingencies (Note 30) ; and estimates of losses related to environmental remediation obligations (Note 30) . Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain comparative figures in our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. 116

Page 117
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries and VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary. A VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. Upon inception of a contractual agreement, we perform an assessment to determine whether the arrangement contains a variable interest in a legal entity and whether that legal entity is a VIE. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Where we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consolidate the accounts of that VIE. We assess all variable interests in the entity and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary. Other qualitative factors that are considered include decision-making responsibilities, the VIE capital structure, risk and rewards sharing, contractual agreements with the VIE, voting rights and level of involvement of other parties. We assess the primary beneficiary determination for a VIE on an ongoing basis if there are changes in the facts and circumstances related to a VIE. If an entity is determined to not be a VIE, the voting interest entity model is applied, where an investor holding the majority voting rights consolidates the entity. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of any limited partnerships where we represent the general partner and, based on all facts and circumstances, control such limited partnerships, unless the limited partner has substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights. For certain investments where we retain an undivided interest in assets and liabilities, we record our proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. Ownership interests in subsidiaries represented by other parties that do not control the entity are presented in the consolidated financial statements as activities and balances attributable to noncontrolling interests. Investments and entities over which we exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. REGULATION Certain of our businesses are subject to regulation by various authorities including, but not limited to, the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Alberta Energy Regulator, the British Columbia (BC) Energy Regulator, the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), the Québec Régie de l’énergie, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (Ohio Commission), the North Carolina Utilities Commission (North Carolina Commission), the Utah Public Service Commission (Utah Commission), the Wyoming Public Service Commission (Wyoming Commission), and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (Idaho Commission). Regulatory bodies exercise statutory authority over matters such as construction, rates and ratemaking, and agreements with customers. To recognize the economic effects of the actions of the regulator, the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses in these operations may differ from that otherwise expected under US GAAP for non-rate-regulated entities. Regulatory assets represent amounts that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates, amounts collected from customers in advance of costs being incurred, or to be paid to cover future abandonment costs and for future removal and site restoration costs as approved by the regulator. If there are changes in our assessment of the probability of recovery for a regulatory asset, we reduce its carrying amount to the balance that we expect to recover from customers in future periods through rates. If a regulator later excludes from allowable costs all or a part of costs that were capitalized as a regulatory asset, we reduce the carrying amount of the asset by the excluded amounts. 117

Page 118
The recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities is based on the actions, or expected future actions, of the regulator. To the extent that the regulator's actions differ from our expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or settlement of regulatory balances could differ significantly from those recorded. In the absence of rate regulation, we would generally not recognize regulatory assets or liabilities and the earnings impact would be recorded in the period the expenses are incurred or revenues are earned. A regulatory asset or liability is recognized in respect of deferred income taxes when it is expected the amounts will be recovered or settled through future regulator-approved rates. We believe that the recovery of our regulatory assets as at December 31, 2024 is probable over the periods described in Note 7 - Regulatory Matters . During the fourth quarter of 2023, Southern Lights Pipeline completed an open season to negotiate new transportation service agreements. We did not renew the agreements under a cost-of-service toll methodology, therefore Southern Lights Pipeline was no longer subject to rate-regulated accounting. As a result, the related regulatory liabilities, regulatory tax assets and associated regulatory deferred tax liabilities were derecognized in 2023. We collect and set aside funds to cover future pipeline abandonment costs for all CER-regulated pipelines in accordance with the Land Matters Consultation Initiative (LMCI) to fund future pipeline decommissioning costs in the state of Minnesota and to satisfy retirement obligations as Wexpro properties are abandoned. The funds collected are held in trusts in accordance with applicable regulations. The funds collected from customers are reported within Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Restricted long-term investments and cash in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Concurrently, for LMCI, we reflect the future abandonment cost as an increase to Operating and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. An allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is included in the cost of property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over future periods as part of the total cost of the related asset. AFUDC includes both an interest component and, if approved by the regulator, a cost of equity component, which are both capitalized based on rates set out in a regulatory agreement. The corresponding impact on earnings is included in Interest expense for the interest component and Other income/(expense) for the equity component. In the absence of rate regulation, we would capitalize interest using a capitalization rate based on our cost of borrowing, whereas the capitalized equity component, the corresponding earnings during the construction phase and the subsequent depreciation relating to the equity component would not be recognized. The equity component of AFUDC is included as a non-cash reconciling item to earnings within Cash Flows from Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under the pool method prescribed by certain regulators, it is not possible to identify the carrying value of the equity component of AFUDC or its effect on depreciation. Similarly, gains and losses on the retirement of certain specific fixed assets in any given year cannot be identified or quantified. With the approval of regulators, certain operations capitalize a portion of specified operating costs. These operations are authorized to charge depreciation and earn a return on the net book value of such capitalized costs in future years. In the absence of rate regulation, a portion of such operating costs would be charged to earnings in the year incurred. For certain regulated operations to which US GAAP guidance for phase-in plans applies, negotiated depreciation rates recovered in transportation tolls may be less than the depreciation expense calculated in accordance with US GAAP in early years of long-term contracts but recovered in future periods when tolls exceed depreciation. Depreciation expense on such assets is recorded in accordance with US GAAP and no regulatory asset is recorded. 118

Page 119
REVENUE RECOGNITION For businesses that are not rate-regulated, revenues are recorded when products have been delivered or services have been performed, the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to agreement signing and throughout the contract duration. Certain revenues from our liquids and natural gas pipeline businesses are recognized under the terms of committed delivery contracts, rather than the cash tolls received. Long-term take-or-pay contracts, under which shippers are obligated to pay fixed amounts ratably over the contract period regardless of volumes shipped, may contain make-up rights. Make-up rights are earned by shippers when minimum volume commitments are not utilized during the period but under certain circumstances can be used to offset overages in future periods, subject to expiry. We recognize revenues associated with make-up rights at the earlier of when the make-up volume is shipped, the make-up right expires, or when it is determined that the likelihood that the shipper will utilize the make-up right is remote. We also have long-term contracts where the revenue profile does not align with the cash receipt schedule, resulting in the recognition of deferred revenue. Certain offshore pipeline transportation contracts require us to provide transportation services for the life of the underlying producing fields. Under these arrangements, shippers pay us a fixed monthly toll for a defined period of time which may be shorter than the estimated reserve life of the underlying producing fields, resulting in a contract period which extends past the period of cash collection. Fixed monthly toll revenues are recognized ratably over the committed volume made available to shippers throughout the contract period, regardless of when cash is received. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash received net of revenue recognized for contracts under make-up rights and similar deferred revenue arrangements was $97 million, $210 million and $238 million, respectively. For rate-regulated businesses, revenues are recognized in a manner that is consistent with the underlying agreements as approved by the regulators. Natural gas utility revenues are generally recorded based on regular meter readings and estimates of customer usage from the last meter reading to the end of the reporting period. Estimates are based on historical consumption patterns and heating degree days experienced. Heating degree days is a measure of coldness that is indicative of volumetric requirements for natural gas utilized for heating purposes in our distribution franchise areas. Certain of our US gas utilities have a revenue decoupling mechanism, referred to as a Customer Usage Tracker (CUT) or Conservation Enabling Tariff (CET), which allows for the collection of an allowed monthly revenue per customer and to promote energy conservation. Under the mechanism, non-gas revenues are decoupled from the temperature-adjusted usage per customer. The difference between actual revenue and the allowed monthly revenue per customer is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability and recovered from, or refunded to, customers through periodic rate adjustments. Amounts deferred under the CUT or CET arise due to specific arrangements with the regulators rather than customers and represent alternative revenue programs. Revenue from alternative revenue programs is recorded within Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the month the related adjustments are deferred and is presented as Other revenues not from contracts with customers when disaggregated in Note 4 - Revenue . Our crude oil, natural gas and power marketing businesses enter into commodity purchase and sale arrangements that are recorded on a gross basis as we are acting as the principal in the transactions. No non-affiliated customer exceeded 10.0% of our third-party revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 119

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING Non-qualifying Derivatives Non-qualifying derivative instruments are used primarily to mitigate foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price earnings exposure. Non-qualifying derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in Commodity sales, Transportation and other services revenues, Commodity costs, Operating and administrative expense, Other income/(expense) and Interest expense. Derivatives in Qualifying Hedging Relationships We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Hedge accounting is optional and requires us to document the hedging relationship and test the hedging item's effectiveness in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged item on an ongoing basis. We present the earnings effects of hedging items with the hedged transaction. Derivatives in qualifying hedging relationships are categorized as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. Cash Flow Hedges We may use cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The change in the fair value of a cash flow hedging instrument is recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI) and is reclassified to earnings when the hedged item impacts earnings. If a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge ceases to be effective or is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued and the gain or loss at that date is deferred in OCI and recognized in earnings concurrently with the related transaction. If an anticipated hedged transaction is no longer probable, the gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings. Subsequent gains and losses from derivative instruments for which hedge accounting has been discontinued are recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Fair Value Hedges We may use fair value hedges to hedge the fair value of debt instruments. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings with changes in the fair value of the hedged risk of the asset or liability that is designated as part of the hedging relationship. If a fair value hedge is discontinued or ceases to be effective, the hedged risk of the asset or liability ceases to be remeasured at fair value and the cumulative fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item. Net Investment Hedges Gains and losses arising from the translation of our net investment in foreign operations from their functional currencies to Enbridge's Canadian dollar presentation currency are included in cumulative translation adjustments (CTA), a component of OCI. We currently have designated a portion of our US dollar-denominated debt, as well as a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts in prior periods, as a hedge of our net investment in US dollar-denominated investments and subsidiaries. As a result, the change in fair value of the foreign currency derivatives, as well as the translation of US dollar- denominated debt, are reflected in OCI. Amounts recognized previously in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) are reclassified to earnings when there is a reduction of the hedged net investment resulting from the disposal of a foreign operation. Classification of Derivatives We recognize the fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as current and non-current assets or liabilities depending on the timing of settlements and the resulting cash flows associated with the instruments. Fair value amounts related to cash flows occurring beyond one year are classified as non-current. 120

Page 121
Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are classified as Cash Flows from Operating and Financing Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Balance Sheet Offset Assets and liabilities arising from derivative instruments may be offset in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when we have the legal right and intention to settle them on a net basis. TRANSACTION COSTS Transaction costs are incremental costs directly related to the acquisition of a financial asset or the issuance of a financial liability. We incur transaction costs primarily from the issuance of debt and account for these costs as a reduction to Long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. These costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt instrument and are recorded in Interest expense. EQUITY INVESTMENTS Equity investments over which we exercise significant influence, but do not have controlling financial interests, are accounted for using the equity method. These investments are initially measured at cost and are adjusted for our proportionate share of undistributed equity earnings or loss. Our equity investments are increased for contributions made to, and decreased for distributions received from, the investee. To the extent an equity investee undertakes activities necessary to commence its planned principal operations, we capitalize interest costs associated with the investment during such period. RESTRICTED LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH Long-term investments and cash that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage, for the purposes of funding pipeline abandonment in accordance with the CER's LMCI, to cover future pipeline decommissioning costs in the state of Minnesota, and to satisfy retirement obligations as Wexpro properties are abandoned, are presented as Restricted long-term investments and cash in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage for the purposes of the CER's LMCI or in accordance with specific commercial and debt arrangements are presented as Restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. OTHER INVESTMENTS Generally, we classify equity investments in entities over which we do not exercise significant influence and that do not have readily determinable fair values as other investments measured using the fair value measurement alternative (FVMA). These investments are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for the impact of observable price changes occurring in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Investments in equity securities measured using the FVMA are reviewed for impairment each reporting period and written down to their fair value if objective evidence of impairment is identified. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value through earnings. Dividends received from investments in equity securities are recognized in earnings when the right to receive payment is established. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and measured at fair value through OCI. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS Noncontrolling interests represent ownership interests attributable to third parties in certain consolidated subsidiaries. The portion of equity not owned by us in such entities is reflected as Noncontrolling interests within the equity section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 121

Page 122
INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for accounting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate that is expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse. For our regulated operations, a deferred income tax liability or asset is recognized with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability, respectively, to the extent that taxes can be recovered through rates. Any interest and/or penalty incurred related to tax is reflected in Income tax expense. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION Foreign currency transactions are those transactions whose terms are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which Enbridge or a reporting subsidiary operates, referred to as the functional currency. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate in effect as at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in earnings in the period in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from the translation of foreign operations' functional currencies to our Canadian dollar presentation currency are included in the CTA component of AOCI and are recognized in earnings upon sale of the foreign operation. Asset and liability accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect as at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with a term to maturity of three months or less when purchased. LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Long-term notes receivable from affiliates are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any impairment losses recognized. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are measured at cost. Interest income is recognized in earnings as it is earned with the passage of time. CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. Other loan receivables and applicable off-balance sheet commitments utilize a discounted cash flow methodology which calculates the current expected credit losses based on historical default probability rates associated with the credit rating of the counterparty and the related term of the loan or commitment, adjusted for forward-looking information and management expectations. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of allowance for expected credit losses of $119 million and $100 million as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. NATURAL GAS IMBALANCES The Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include balances as a result of differences in gas volumes received from, and delivered for, customers. As settlement of certain imbalances is in-kind, changes in the balances do not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Most natural gas volumes owed to or by us are valued at natural gas market index prices as at the balance sheet dates. 122

Page 123
INVENTORY Inventory is comprised of natural gas held in storage by businesses in our Gas Distribution and Storage and Gas Transmission segments, crude oil and natural gas held by our crude oil and natural gas marketing businesses, and materials and supplies. Natural gas held in storage by our Gas Distribution and Storage businesses is recorded at the prices approved by the regulators in the determination of distribution rates. The actual price of gas purchased may differ from the regulator approved price. The difference between the approved price and the actual cost of gas purchased is deferred as a liability for future refund, or as an asset for collection, as approved by the regulators. Commodity inventory held by our crude oil and natural gas marketing businesses is recorded at the lower of cost, as determined on a weighted average basis, or market value. Upon disposition, commodity inventory is recorded to Commodity costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings at the weighted average cost of inventory, including any adjustments recorded to reduce inventory to market value. Materials and supplies inventory is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Expenditures for construction, expansion, major renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for project development are capitalized if they are expected to have future benefit. We capitalize interest incurred during construction for non-rate-regulated assets. For rate-regulated assets, AFUDC is included in the cost of property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over future periods as part of the total cost of the related asset. Two primary methods of depreciation are utilized. For distinct assets, depreciation is generally provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset commencing when it is placed in service. For largely homogeneous groups of assets with comparable useful lives, the pool method of accounting is followed whereby similar assets are grouped and depreciated as a pool. When group assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains and losses are generally not reflected in earnings but are booked as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation. The successful efforts method of accounting is used for cost-of-service reserves developed and produced by Wexpro for gas utility affiliate, Questar. Cost-of-service reserves are properties for which the operations and return on investment are subject to the Wexpro Agreements. Under the successful efforts method, Wexpro capitalizes the costs of acquiring leaseholds, drilling development wells, drilling successful exploratory wells, and purchasing related support equipment and facilities. Geological and geophysical studies are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs of development wells and leaseholds are amortized on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method and the estimated proved developed or total proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. LEASES We recognize an arrangement as a lease when a customer has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an asset, as well as the right to direct the use of the asset. We recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and the related lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position for operating lease arrangements with a term of 12 months or longer. We do not separate non-lease components from the associated lease components of our lessee contracts and account for both components as a single lease component. We combine lease and non-lease components within a contract for operating lessor leases when certain conditions are met. ROU assets are assessed for impairment using the same approach applied for other long-lived assets. 123

Page 124
Lease liabilities and ROU assets require the use of judgment and estimates which are applied in determining the term of a lease, appropriate discount rates, whether an arrangement contains a lease, whether there are any indicators of impairment for ROU assets and whether any ROU assets should be grouped with other long-lived assets for impairment testing. The lease term may include periods associated with options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain the options will be exercised. DEFERRED AMOUNTS AND OTHER ASSETS Deferred amounts and other assets primarily consists of costs that regulatory authorities have permitted, or are expected to permit, to be recovered through future rates (Note 7) , overfunded defined benefit pension and OPEB plan assets (Note 25) , operating lease ROU assets (Note 26) and long-term gross derivative asset balances (Note 23) . INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets consist primarily of certain software costs, customer relationships and biogas rights agreements. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software projects . Customer relationships represent the underlying relationship from long-term agreements with customers that are capitalized upon acquisition. Biogas rights agreements are long-term gas supply agreements with landfill owners of our landfill gas-to-RNG production facilities that are capitalized upon acquisition. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives, commencing when the asset is available for use. GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets upon acquisition of a business. The carrying value of goodwill, which is not amortized, is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. We perform our annual review of the goodwill balance on April 1. We perform our annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components, and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. Our reporting units are Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Renewable Power Generation. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. When performing a qualitative assessment, we determine the drivers of fair value for each reporting unit and evaluate whether those drivers have been positively or negatively affected by relevant events and circumstances since the last fair value assessment. Our evaluation includes, but is not limited to, the assessment of macroeconomic trends (including the impact of changes in discount rates and rate base multiple), changes to regulatory environments, capital accessibility, operating income trends (including changes to projected cash flows from operations, expected future capital expenditures and forecasted rate base), and changes to industry conditions. Based on our assessment of qualitative factors, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment is performed. 124

Page 125
The quantitative goodwill impairment assessment involves determining the fair value of our reporting units and comparing those values to the carrying value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. This amount should not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow technique requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, projected operating income, expected future capital expenditures and working capital levels, as well as terminal value growth rates for the Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, and Renewable Power Generation reporting units, and projected regulatory rate base and rate base multiple for the Gas Distribution and Storage reporting unit. The allocation of goodwill to held-for-sale and disposed businesses is based on the relative fair value of businesses included in the relevant reporting unit. On April 1, 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment which consisted of a qualitative assessment for the Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Renewable Power Generation reporting units and did not identify impairment indicators. No indicators of goodwill impairment were identified during the remainder of 2024. IMPAIRMENT We review the carrying values of our long-lived assets as events or changes in circumstances warrant. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its expected undiscounted cash flows, we will calculate fair value based on the discounted cash flows and write the asset down to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. With respect to investments in debt securities and equity investments, we assess at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired by completing a qualitative or quantitative analysis of factors impacting the investment. If there is objective evidence of impairment, we value the expected discounted cash flows using observable market inputs. We determine whether the decline below carrying value is other-than-temporary for equity investments or is due to a credit loss for investments in debt securities. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary for equity investments or is due to a credit loss for investments in debt securities, an impairment charge is recorded in earnings with an offsetting reduction to the carrying value of the investment. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARO associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are measured at fair value and recognized as Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities in the period in which they can be reasonably determined. Fair value approximates the cost a third party would charge to perform the tasks necessary to retire such assets and is recognized at the present value of expected future cash flows. ARO is added to the carrying value of the associated asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The corresponding liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings and is reduced by actual costs of decommissioning and reclamation. Our estimates of retirement costs could change as a result of changes in cost estimates and regulatory requirements. Currently, for the majority of our assets, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of ARO due to the indeterminate timing and scope of the asset retirements. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS We sponsor defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as defined benefit OPEB plans. Obligations and net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are estimated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on years of service, as well as our best estimates of actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, future salary levels, other cost escalations, employees' retirement ages, and mortality. 125

Page 126
We determine discount rates using market yields of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities that approximate the estimated timing of future benefit payments. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The expected return on plan assets is determined using the long- term target asset mixes in our investment policies and long-term market expectations. Actuarial gains and losses arise from the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rates. Periodic net actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are accumulated and presented as follows in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position: • as a component of AOCI, for our non-utilities' defined benefit pension plans and certain defined benefit OPEB plans; and • as a component of Deferred amounts and other assets and/or Other long-term liabilities for certain utilities' defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans, to the extent that the net actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs have been permitted or are expected to be permitted by the regulators, to be recovered through future rates. Net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings and includes: • current service cost; • interest cost; • expected return on plan assets; • amortization of prior service costs over the expected average remaining service life of the plans' active employee group; and • amortization of net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets over the expected average remaining service life of the plans' active employee group. Our utility operations also record regulatory adjustments for the difference between net periodic benefit costs for accounting versus ratemaking purposes. Offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to the extent net periodic benefit costs are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers, respectively, in future rates. In the absence of rate regulation, regulatory assets or liabilities would not be recorded and net periodic benefit costs would be charged to earnings and OCI on an accrual basis. For defined contribution plans, our contributions are expensed when they occur. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Incentive stock options (ISO) granted are recorded using the fair value method. Under this method, compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the ISO granted as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton model and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period to early retirement eligibility, with a corresponding credit to Additional paid-in capital. Balances in Additional paid-in capital are transferred to Share capital when the options are exercised. 126

Page 127
Performance stock units (PSU) and certain RSUs are cash-settled awards for which the related liability is remeasured each reporting period. PSUs vest at the completion of a three-year term and RSUs vest one- third annually from the grant date. During the vesting term, compensation expense is recorded based on the number of units outstanding and the current market price of Enbridge's common shares with an offset to Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities. The value of the PSUs is also dependent on our performance relative to targets set out under the plan. We also award share-settled RSUs to certain non- executive senior management employees which vest at the completion of a three-year term. Beginning in 2023, share-settled RSUs were also granted to non-executive employees, which vest either one-third annually from the grant date, or following a 12-month period. During the vesting term, compensation expense is recorded based on the number of units granted and the market price of Enbridge's common shares on the day immediately preceding the grant date, with an offset to Additional paid-in capital. There is no associated liability recorded for share-settled awards. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES We expense or capitalize, as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to past or current operations. We expense costs incurred for remediation of existing environmental contamination caused by past operations that do not benefit future periods by preventing or eliminating future contamination. We record liabilities for environmental matters when assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors. These amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites, other companies' clean-up experience and data released by government organizations. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information and are included in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at their undiscounted amounts. There is always a potential of incurring additional costs in connection with environmental liabilities due to variations in any or all of the categories described above, including modified or revised requirements from regulatory agencies, in addition to fines and penalties, as well as expenditures associated with litigation and settlement of claims. We evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from the liability and, when recovery is probable, we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Liabilities for other commitments and contingencies are recognized when, after fully analyzing available information, we determine it is either probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we recognize the most likely amount, or if no amount is more likely than another, the minimum of the range of probable loss is accrued. We expense legal costs associated with loss contingencies as such costs are incurred. 127

3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES There were no changes in accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2024. ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Segment Reporting Effective January 1, 2024, with interim disclosure requirements effective after January 1, 2025, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 on a retrospective basis beginning on January 1, 2022. The new standard was issued in November 2023 to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and to require in interim period financial statements all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The ASU requires entities to disclose the title and position of the individual or the name of the group or committee identified as the CODM. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. FUTURE ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 was issued in December 2023 to improve income tax disclosures by requiring specified categories in the annual rate reconciliation that meet quantitative thresholds and further disaggregation on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective January 1, 2025 and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application being permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the new standard on the presentation of Note 24 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ASU 2024-03 was issued in November 2024 to improve financial reporting by requiring entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. The ASU requires entities to disclose 1) the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) intangible asset amortization, (e) depreciation, depletion and amortization recognized as part of oil and gas producing activities, (f) expense reimbursements included in a relevant expense caption, and (g) selling expenses, and 2) a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. ASU 2024-03 is effective January 1, 2027, with interim period disclosure requirements effective after January 1, 2028 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2027 and on our interim disclosures beginning in 2028. 4. REVENUE Change in Revenue Classification To better align the classification of revenues resulting from our acquisitions of the US gas utilities (Note 8) , we have made adjustments to Gas distribution sales and Transportation and other services revenues. Revenues generated from customers who procure their own gas but use our distribution system for delivery to the end use location have been reclassified to Gas distribution sales revenue from Transportation and other services revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and reclassified to Gas distribution sales from Transportation revenue in the Revenue from Contracts with Customers tables below. Our prior period comparable results have been recast to reflect the change in revenue classification. This change does not have an impact on our Total operating revenues. 128

Refer to Note 26 - Leases . 3 These balances reflect a transfer from Transportation revenue to Gas distribution sales of $602 million and $584 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We disaggregate revenue into categories which represent our principal performance obligations within each business segment. These revenue categories represent the most significant revenue streams in each segment and consequently are considered to be the most relevant revenue information for management to consider in evaluating performance. 129

Contract Balances Contract Receivables Contract Assets Contract Liabilities (millions of Canadian dollars) Balance as at December 31, 2024 3,764 330 2,828 Balance as at December 31, 2023 2,802 400 2,591 Contract receivables represent the amount of receivables derived from contracts with customers. Contract assets represent the amount of revenue which has been recognized in advance of payments received for performance obligations we have fulfilled (or have partially fulfilled) and prior to the point in time at which our right to the payment is unconditional. Amounts included in contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when our right to the consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent payments received for performance obligations which have not been fulfilled. Contract liabilities primarily relate to make-up rights and deferred revenue. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the year is $372 million. Increases in contract liabilities from cash received, net of amounts recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, were $532 million. Performance Obligations Segment Nature of Performance Obligation Liquids Pipelines • Transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) Gas Transmission • Transportation, storage, gathering, compression and treating of natural gas • Transportation of crude oil and NGL • Sale of renewable natural gas and its attached environmental attributes Gas Distribution and Storage • Supply and delivery of natural gas • Transportation of natural gas • Storage of natural gas Renewable Power Generation • Generation and transmission of electricity • Delivery of electricity from renewable energy generation facilities There was no material revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. Payment Terms Payments are received monthly from customers under long-term transportation, commodity sales, and gas gathering and processing contracts. Payments from Gas Distribution and Storage customers are received on a continuous basis based on established billing cycles. Certain contracts in our US offshore business provide for us to receive a series of fixed monthly payments (FMPs) for a specified period that is less than the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied. As a result, a portion of the FMPs are recorded as contract liabilities. The FMPs are not considered to be a financing arrangement as payments are scheduled to match the production profiles of offshore oil and gas fields, which generate greater revenue in the initial years of their productive lives. 130

Page 131
Revenue to be Recognized from Unfulfilled Performance Obligations The following table presents our estimated revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, that is expected to be recognized in the following periods: Total 1 year 2-5 years Thereafter (billions of Canadian dollars) Expected revenue 62.6 10.4 25.2 27.0 The revenues excluded from the amounts above based on optional exemptions available under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, as explained below, represent a significant portion of our overall revenues and revenues from contracts with customers. Certain revenues such as flow-through operating costs charged to shippers are recognized at the amount for which we have the right to invoice our customers and are excluded from the amounts of revenue to be recognized in the future from unfulfilled performance obligations above. Variable consideration is excluded from the amounts above due to the uncertainty of the associated consideration, which is generally resolved when actual volumes and prices are determined. For example, we consider interruptible transportation service revenues to be variable revenues since volumes cannot be estimated. Additionally, the effect of escalation on certain tolls which are contractually escalated for inflation has not been reflected in the amounts above as it is not possible to reliably estimate future inflation rates. Revenues for periods extending beyond the current rate settlement term for regulated contracts where the tolls are periodically reset by the regulator are excluded from the amounts above since future tolls remain unknown. Finally, revenues from contracts with customers which have an original expected duration of one year or less are excluded from the amounts above. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS MADE IN RECOGNIZING REVENUE Long-Term Transportation Agreements For long-term transportation agreements, significant judgments pertain to the period over which revenue is recognized and whether the agreement provides for make-up rights for the shippers. Transportation revenue earned from firm contracted capacity arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract period. Transportation revenue from interruptible or volumetric-based arrangements is recognized when services are performed. Variable Consideration Revenue from arrangements subject to variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Uncertainties associated with variable consideration relate principally to differences between estimated and actual volumes and prices. These uncertainties are resolved each month when actual volumes are sold or transported and actual tolls and prices are determined. On March 4, 2024, the CER approved the negotiated Mainline tolling settlement. The new tolls are finalized and were in effect on an interim basis on July 1, 2023, and the overall agreement is retroactively effective as of July 1, 2021 through to the end of 2028. 131

Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time For arrangements involving the transportation and sale of petroleum products and natural gas where the transportation services or commodities are simultaneously received and consumed by the shipper or customer, we recognize revenue over time using an output method based on volumes of commodities delivered or transported. The measurement of the volumes transported or delivered corresponds directly to the benefits received by the shippers or customers during that period. Determination of Transaction Prices Prices for transportation and gas processing services are determined based on the capital cost of the facilities, pipelines and associated infrastructure required to provide such services, plus a rate of return on capital invested that is determined either through negotiations with customers or through regulatory processes for those operations that are subject to rate regulation. Prices for commodities sold are determined by reference to market price indices, plus or minus a negotiated differential and in certain cases a marketing fee. Prices for natural gas sold and distribution services provided by regulated natural gas distribution operations are prescribed by regulation. 132

6. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BASIC Earnings per common share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. DILUTED The treasury stock method is used to determine the dilutive impact of stock options and share-settled RSUs. This method assumes any proceeds from the exercise of stock options and vesting of share- settled RSUs would be used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period. Weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per common share are as follows: December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (number of shares in millions) Weighted average shares outstanding 2,155 2,056 2,025 Effect of dilutive options and RSUs 3 2 4 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 2,158 2,058 2,029 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 14.6 million, 19.3 million and 10.4 million, respectively, of anti-dilutive stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $54.37, $54.42 and $56.49, respectively, were excluded from the diluted earnings per common share calculation. 7. REGULATORY MATTERS We record assets and liabilities that result from regulated ratemaking processes that would not be recorded under US GAAP for non-regulated entities. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion. Our significant regulated businesses and the related accounting impacts are described below. Under the current authorized rate structure for certain operations, income tax costs are recovered in rates based on the current income tax payable and do not include accruals for deferred income tax. However, as income taxes become payable as a result of the reversal of temporary differences that created the deferred income taxes, it is expected that rates will be adjusted to recover these taxes. Since most of these temporary differences are related to property, plant and equipment costs, this recovery is expected to occur over the life of the related assets. In the absence of rate-regulated accounting, this regulatory tax asset and the related earnings impact would not be recorded. 135

LIQUIDS PIPELINES Canadian Mainline Canadian Mainline includes the Canadian portion of our Mainline system. The Mainline Tolling Settlement (MTS), governs the tolls paid for products shipped on its Mainline System, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis and was approved by the CER on March 4, 2024. The MTS has a seven-and-a-half year term through the end of 2028 and continues with the previous CTS framework with a Canadian Local Toll for all volumes shipped on the Canadian Mainline and an International Joint Tariff for all volumes shipped from western Canadian receipt points to delivery points on our Lakehead System. We have recognized a regulatory asset of $2.0 billion as at December 31, 2024 (2023 - $1.9 billion) to offset deferred income taxes, as a CER rate order governing flow-through income tax treatment permits future recovery. No other material regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized under the terms of the MTS. Southern Lights Pipeline In February 2024, we entered into fixed-toll agreements for a five-year term. As at December 31, 2023, since we did not expect to renew the agreements under a cost-of-service toll methodology, Southern Lights Pipeline was no longer subject to rate-regulated accounting. As a result, $151 million of net regulatory liabilities, $92 million of regulatory tax assets and $23 million of regulatory deferred tax liabilities were derecognized in 2023. GAS TRANSMISSION British Columbia Pipeline and Maritimes & Northeast Canada British Columbia (BC) Pipeline and Maritimes & Northeast Canada (M&N Canada) are regulated by the CER. Rates are approved by the CER through negotiated toll settlement agreements based on cost-of- service. Both our BC Pipeline and M&N Canada systems currently operate under the terms of their respective 2022-2026 and 2024-2025 settlement agreements, which stipulate an allowable return on equity (ROE) and the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts. M&N Canada reached a toll settlement with shippers for the effective period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2025. On November 28, 2023, M&N Canada filed the 2024-2025 toll settlement agreement with the CER, which was approved on February 14, 2024, as filed. US Gas Transmission The majority of our US gas transmission and storage services are regulated by the FERC and may also be subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal, state and local agencies. The FERC regulates natural gas transmission in US interstate commerce including the establishment of rates for services, while rates for intrastate commerce and/or gathering services are regulated by the state gas commissions. Cost-of-service is the basis for the calculation of regulated tariff rates, although the FERC also allows the use of negotiated and discounted rates within contracts with shippers that may result in a rate that is above or below the FERC-regulated recourse rate for that service. 136

GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE Enbridge Gas Ontario Enbridge Gas Ontario's distribution rates, commencing in 2024, were set by the OEB under a five-year Incentive Regulation (IR) framework. The framework included the establishment of 2024 base rates on a cost-of-service basis, while rates for 2025 through 2028 will be established using a price cap mechanism. The price cap mechanism will establish new rates each year through an annual base rate adjustment to expense an incremental $50 million of capitalized overheads as operating and maintenance costs; annual base rate escalation at inflation less a 0.28% productivity factor; annual updates for certain costs to be passed through to customers; and, where applicable, it will provide for the recovery of material unexpected events and discrete incremental capital investments beyond those that can be funded through base rates. The price cap mechanism includes the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires Enbridge Gas Ontario to share equally with customers any earnings in excess of 100 basis points over the allowed ROE, and share 90% of earnings in excess of 300 basis points over the allowed ROE. Enbridge Gas Ohio Enbridge Gas Ohio is subject to the jurisdiction of the Ohio Commission with its natural gas sales and transportation and storage services being provided under rate schedules approved by the regulatory commission. Enbridge Gas Ohio uses a straight-fixed-variable rate design, where majority of operating costs are recovered through a monthly charge, as established in a 2008 rate case settlement. In October 2023, Enbridge Gas Ohio filed for a non-fuel base rate increase of $212 million projected to be effective January 2025. This base rate increase aims to recover investments in distribution infrastructure for the benefit of Ohio customers. The proposed rates would provide an ROE of 10.40% compared to the currently authorized 10.38%. Additionally, Enbridge Gas Ohio also requested approval for an alternative rate plan for the continuation and modification of the Pipeline Infrastructure Replacement (PIR) and the Capital Expenditure Program (CEP). On December 18, 2024, Enbridge Gas Ohio filed a Notice of Intent to Modify Filed Positions. The Notice of Intent indicated a willingness to accept a reduced annual revenue requirement increase (from $212 million to $60 million) and, if the reduced position were adopted, to forgo filing a new base rate case until October 31, 2027. The hearing began on January 13, 2025, and remains underway. The PIR program aims to replace 25% of the pipeline system. In April 2022, the Ohio Commission extended the PIR program through 2026. The CEP allows Enbridge Gas Ohio to defer depreciation expense, property tax expense and carrying costs at the debt rate of 6.5% on capital investments not covered by its PIR program. In September 2024, the Ohio Commission approved adjustments to CEP cost recovery rates for 2023 costs. Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming and Enbridge Gas Idaho Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming and Enbridge Gas Idaho are regulated by the Utah Commission, the Wyoming Commission, and the Idaho Commission. For rate oversight of Enbridge Gas Idaho's operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho, the Idaho Commission has contracted with Utah Commission. Both Utah and Wyoming Commissions allow for the recovery of gas costs through a balancing-account mechanism. 137

Page 138
Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming and Enbridge Gas Idaho use several mechanisms to manage costs and promote efficiency. They recover gas costs through a balance-account mechanism that adjusts rates periodically to reflect changes in natural gas prices. The Infrastructure Replacement Program allows Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming, and Enbridge Gas Idaho to earn a return on capital expenditures for infrastructure replacement. The CET decouples non-gas revenues from customer usage, enabling the collection of allowed revenue per customer and encourages energy conservation. The Energy Efficiency Program promotes natural gas conservation through advertising, rebates, and home energy plans. These costs are recovered through periodic rate adjustments. The Utah Commission approved the construction of natural gas infrastructure to extend services to rural Utah, including 30 miles of intermediate high-pressure pipeline and up to 500 service lines. Recent approvals also include adjustments in the rural expansion rate tracker. Enbridge Gas North Carolina Enbridge Gas North Carolina is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the North Carolina Commission. Base rates for Enbridge Gas North Carolina are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. The North Carolina Commission authorized Enbridge Gas North Carolina to use a tracker mechanism to recover costs related to pipeline integrity and safety requirements that are not included in current base rates. Enbridge Gas North Carolina uses several mechanisms to adjust rates and recover costs. CUT allows for rate adjustments based on changes in customer usage patterns. Rider D enables the recovery of gas purchases from customers, with rates periodically adjusted to reflect market price changes. Rider F facilitates the recovery of costs associated with energy efficiency measures and programs. 138

FINANCIAL STATEMENT EFFECTS Accounting for rate-regulated activities has resulted in the recognition of the following regulatory assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. December 31, 2024 2023 Recovery/Refund Period Ends (millions of Canadian dollars) Current regulatory assets Purchase gas variance 74 15 2025 Under-recovery of fuel costs 4 75 2025 Deferred projects costs 1 90 — 2025 Other current regulatory assets 304 380 2025 Total current regulatory assets 2 (Note 9) 472 470 Long-term regulatory assets Deferred income taxes 3 4,698 4,456 Various Deferred projects costs 1 1,045 — Various Long-term debt 4 318 348 2032-2046 Negative salvage 5 136 180 Various Demand-side management costs 237 54 Various Pension plan receivable 6 266 1 Various Other long-term regulatory assets 447 198 Various Total long-term regulatory assets 2 7,147 5,237 Total regulatory assets 7,619 5,707 Current regulatory liabilities Purchase gas variance 292 31 2025 Regulatory liability related to US income taxes 7 44 — 2025 Other current regulatory liabilities 280 276 2025 Total current regulatory liabilities 8 (Note 16) 616 307 Long-term regulatory liabilities Future removal and site restoration reserves 9 2,964 1,693 Various Regulatory liability related to US income taxes 7 2,021 854 Various Pipeline future abandonment costs (Note 23) 826 745 Various Pension plan payable 6 59 143 Various Other long-term regulatory liabilities 242 86 Various Total long-term regulatory liabilities 8 6,112 3,521 Total regulatory liabilities 6,728 3,828 1 Represents the amounts anticipated to be collected from customers in East Ohio’s service areas for rider projects, including CEP, PIR and costs related to the Pipeline Safety Management Program. The recovery periods for these expenditures vary according to the stipulations outlined in the respective riders. For Enbridge Gas North Carolina, these amounts relate to pipeline integrity management which represent operating costs incurred to comply with federal regulatory requirements related to natural gas pipelines and have been deferred pending future approval of rate recovery. 2 Current regulatory assets are included in Other current assets, while long-term regulatory assets are included in Deferred amounts and other assets. 3 Represents the regulatory offset to deferred income tax liabilities to the extent that it is expected to be included in future regulator- approved rates and recovered from customers. The recovery period depends on the timing of the reversal of temporary differences. In the absence of rate-regulated accounting, this regulatory balance and the related earnings impact would not be recorded. The balance as at December 31, 2024 is net of regulatory deferred tax write-offs. 4 Represents our regulatory offset to the fair value adjustment to debt acquired in our merger with Spectra Energy Corp. (Spectra Energy). The offset is viewed as a proxy for the regulatory asset that would be recorded in the event such debt was extinguished at an amount higher than the carrying value. 5 The negative salvage balance represents the recovery in future rates of the actual cost of removal of previously retired or decommissioned plant assets, as approved by the FERC. 6 Represents the regulatory offset to our pension liability to the extent that it is expected to be included in regulator-approved future rates and recovered from customers. The settlement period for this balance is not determinable. In the absence of rate-regulated accounting, this regulatory balance and the related pension expense would be recorded in earnings and OCI. 139

Page 140
7 The regulatory liability related to US income taxes resulted from the US tax reform legislation dated December 22, 2017. These balances will be refunded to customers in accordance with the respective rate settlements approved by the FERC for our US Gas Transmission pipelines and by the respective state utility commission for each US Gas Distribution franchise. 8 Current regulatory liabilities are included in Other current liabilities, while long-term regulatory liabilities are included in Other long- term liabilities. 9 Future removal and site restoration reserves consists of amounts collected from customers, with the approval of the respective regulatory authorities, to fund future costs of removal and site restoration relating to property, plant and equipment. These costs are collected as part of the depreciation expense charged on property, plant and equipment that is reflected in rates. The settlement of this balance will occur over the long-term as costs are incurred. In the absence of rate-regulated accounting, depreciation rates would not include a charge for removal and site restoration and costs would be charged to earnings as incurred with recognition of revenue for amounts previously collected. 8. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION BUSINESS COMBINATIONS We accounted for each of the acquisitions discussed below using the acquisition method as prescribed by ASC 805 Business Combinations . In accordance with valuation methodologies described in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement , acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values as at the date of acquisition. The fair values of regulatory assets and liabilities, which are subject to rate-setting and cost recovery mechanisms under ASC 980 Regulated Operations , are equal to their carrying values at acquisition. The recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities is based on the actions, or expected future actions, of the regulator. To the extent that the regulator's actions differ from our expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or settlement of regulatory balances could differ significantly from those recorded at acquisition. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated On September 30, 2024, through a wholly-owned US subsidiary, we acquired all of the membership interests of Fall North Carolina Holdco LLC, which owns 100% of PSNC, for cash consideration of $2.7 billion (US$2.0 billion) (the PSNC Acquisition). PSNC is a public utility primarily engaged in the purchase, sale, transportation and distribution of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers in North Carolina. PSNC operates under rates approved by the North Carolina Commission. Subsequent to its acquisition, PSNC conducts business as Enbridge Gas North Carolina. The following table summarizes the estimated preliminary fair values that were assigned to the net assets of PSNC: September 30, 2024 1 (millions of Canadian dollars) Fair value of net assets acquired: Current assets (a) 303 Property, plant and equipment (b) 4,147 Long-term assets (c) 189 Current liabilities 277 Long-term debt (d) 1,529 Other long-term liabilities (e) 653 Deferred income tax liabilities 365 Goodwill (f) 895 Purchase price: Cash 2,710 1 In the fourth quarter of 2024, immaterial adjustments were made to the PSNC Acquisition purchase price allocation. a) Current assets consist primarily of cash, trade and other accounts receivable, regulatory assets and inventory. The fair value of trade receivables from customers approximates their carrying value of $70 million due to the short period to maturity. A provision of $2 million for expected credit loss associated with accounts receivable has been recorded. 140

Page 141
b) PSNC's property, plant and equipment constitutes an integrated system of rate-regulated natural gas transmission, distribution and storage assets. For these rate-regulated assets, fair value was determined using a market participant perspective. Given the regulated nature of, and fixed return on the assets, the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired is equal to its carrying value. c) Long-term assets consist primarily of $114 million of regulatory assets expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates and equity interests in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facility in North Carolina and in an intrastate natural gas pipeline. d) The fair value of long-term debt was determined based on the current underlying US Treasury interest rates on instruments of similar credit risk and tenor, as well as an implied credit spread based on current market conditions. We recorded a fair value adjustment to reduce long-term debt by $156 million with no corresponding regulatory offset. e) Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of regulatory liabilities expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates. f) Goodwill is primarily attributable to the existing assembled assets and workforce of PSNC that cannot be duplicated at the same cost by a new entrant and the enhanced scale and geographic diversity of our regulated natural gas distribution business, which provides a platform for future growth and optimization with existing assets. The goodwill balance recognized has been assigned to our Gas Distribution and Storage segment and is not tax deductible. Upon completion of the PSNC Acquisition, we began consolidating PSNC. For the period beginning September 30, 2024 through to December 31, 2024, PSNC generated $284 million of operating revenues and $50 million of earnings attributable to common shareholders. Our supplemental pro forma consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, including the results of operations for PSNC as if the PSNC Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2023, is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 (unaudited; millions of Canadian dollars) Operating revenues 54,116 44,614 Earnings attributable to common shareholders 1 5,149 5,944 1 Includes adjustment for pro forma interest expense on debt financing for the PSNC Acquisition of $48 million (after-tax of $37 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. 141

Questar Gas Company On May 31, 2024, through a wholly-owned US subsidiary, we acquired all of the membership interests of Fall West Holdco LLC which owns 100% of Questar and Wexpro for cash consideration of $4.1 billion (US$3.0 billion) (the Questar Acquisition). Questar is a public natural gas utility providing distribution, storage and transmission services to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Utah, southwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho. The Utah Commission, the Wyoming Commission and the Idaho Commission have granted Questar the necessary regulatory approvals to serve these areas. Wexpro develops and produces cost-of-service gas reserves for Questar and operates under agreements with the states of Utah and Wyoming. Subsequent to its acquisition, Questar conducts business as Enbridge Gas Utah, Enbridge Gas Wyoming and Enbridge Gas Idaho in those respective states. The following table summarizes the estimated preliminary fair values that were assigned to the net assets of Questar and Wexpro: May 31, 2024 1 (millions of Canadian dollars) Fair value of net assets acquired: Current assets (a) 380 Property, plant and equipment (b) 6,013 Long-term assets (c) 163 Current liabilities 416 Long-term debt (d) 1,343 Other long-term liabilities (e) 919 Deferred income tax liabilities 527 Goodwill (f) 793 Purchase price: Cash 4,144 1 In the fourth quarter of 2024, immaterial adjustments were made to the Questar Acquisition purchase price allocation. a) Current assets consist primarily of cash, trade and other accounts receivable and inventory. The fair value of trade receivables from customers approximates their carrying value of $202 million due to the short period to maturity. A provision of $9 million for expected credit loss associated with accounts receivable has been recorded. b) Questar's property, plant and equipment constitutes an integrated system of rate-regulated natural gas transmission, distribution and storage assets. Wexpro's property, plant and equipment consists of cost- of-service gas and oil properties developed and produced for Questar. For these rate-regulated assets, fair value was determined using a market participant perspective. Given the regulated nature of, and fixed return on the assets, the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired is equal to its carrying value. c) Long-term assets consist primarily of funds collected from Questar by Wexpro and held in trust to fund future AROs, as well as regulatory assets expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates. d) The fair value of long-term debt was determined based on the current underlying US Treasury interest rates on instruments of similar credit risk and tenor, as well as an implied credit spread based on current market conditions. We recorded a fair value adjustment to reduce long-term debt by $301 million with no corresponding regulatory offset. e) Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of regulatory liabilities, expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates, as well as ARO. The fair value of the ARO liability was determined using a discounted cash flow approach. 142

Page 143
f) Goodwill is primarily attributable to the existing assembled assets and workforce of Questar and Wexpro that cannot be duplicated at the same cost by a new entrant and the enhanced scale and geographic diversity of our regulated natural gas distribution business, which provides a platform for future growth and optimization with existing assets. The goodwill balance recognized has been assigned to our Gas Distribution and Storage segment and is not tax deductible. Upon completion of the Questar Acquisition, we began consolidating Questar and Wexpro. For the period beginning May 31, 2024 through to December 31, 2024, Questar and Wexpro generated $755 million of operating revenues and $75 million of earnings attributable to common shareholders. Our supplemental pro forma consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, including the results of operations for Questar and Wexpro as if the Questar Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2023, is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 (unaudited; millions of Canadian dollars) Operating revenues 54,698 45,918 Earnings attributable to common shareholders 1 5,193 6,005 1 Includes adjustment for pro forma interest expense on debt financing for the Questar Acquisition of $70 million (after-tax of $53 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The East Ohio Gas Company On March 6, 2024, through a wholly-owned US subsidiary, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of EOG for cash consideration of $5.8 billion (US$4.3 billion) (the EOG Acquisition). EOG is a public natural gas utility providing distribution, storage and transmission services to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio and is regulated by the Ohio Commission. Subsequent to its acquisition, EOG conducts business as Enbridge Gas Ohio. The following table summarizes the estimated preliminary fair values that were assigned to the net assets of EOG: March 6, 2024 1 (millions of Canadian dollars) Fair value of net assets acquired: Current assets (a) 493 Property, plant and equipment (b) 7,276 Long-term assets (c) 1,689 Current liabilities 551 Long-term debt (d) 2,612 Other long-term liabilities (e) 1,001 Deferred income tax liabilities 1,045 Goodwill (f) 1,603 Purchase price: Cash 5,852 1 In the fourth quarter of 2024, immaterial adjustments were made to the EOG Acquisition purchase price allocation. a) Current assets consist primarily of trade and other accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, regulatory assets and inventory. The fair value of trade receivables from customers approximates their carrying value of $379 million due to the short period to maturity. A provision of $3 million for expected credit loss associated with accounts receivable has been recorded. 143

Page 144
b) EOG's property, plant and equipment constitutes an integrated system of rate-regulated natural gas transmission, gathering, distribution and storage assets. For these rate-regulated assets, fair value was determined using a market participant perspective. Given the regulated nature of, and fixed return on the assets, the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired is equal to its carrying value. c) Long-term assets consist primarily of overfunded pension plan assets of $367 million and $1.2 billion of regulatory assets expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates. Pension plan assets attributable to the workforce acquired from EOG were transferred in cash to an Enbridge-sponsored pension plan based on their fair value as at March 6, 2024. The fair value of plan assets was determined using unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments. d) The fair value of long-term debt was determined based on the current underlying US Treasury interest rates on instruments of similar credit risk and tenor, as well as an implied credit spread based on current market conditions. We recorded a fair value adjustment to reduce long-term debt by $478 million with no corresponding regulatory offset. e) Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of regulatory liabilities expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates. f) Goodwill is primarily attributable to the existing assembled assets and workforce of EOG that cannot be duplicated at the same cost by a new entrant and the enhanced scale and geographic diversity of our regulated natural gas distribution business, which provides a platform for future growth and optimization with existing assets. The goodwill balance recognized has been assigned to our Gas Distribution and Storage segment and is not tax deductible. Upon completion of the EOG Acquisition, we began consolidating EOG. For the period beginning March 6, 2024 through to December 31, 2024, EOG generated $1.2 billion of operating revenues and $190 million of earnings attributable to common shareholders. Our supplemental pro forma consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, including the results of operations for EOG as if the EOG Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2023, is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 (unaudited; millions of Canadian dollars) Operating revenues 53,788 45,058 Earnings attributable to common shareholders 1 5,130 5,961 1 Includes adjustment for pro forma interest expense on debt financing for the EOG Acquisition of $100 million (after-tax of $77 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. 144

The purchase price allocations for the PSNC Acquisition, Questar Acquisition and EOG Acquisition (together, the Acquisitions) were prepared on a preliminary basis and are subject to change as additional information becomes available concerning the fair values of the ARO and regulatory balances and their tax bases. Any adjustments to the purchase price allocations will be made as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the date of each acquisition. The Acquisitions further diversify, and are complementary to, our existing gas distribution operations. Acquisition of RNG Facilities On January 2, 2024, through a wholly-owned US subsidiary, we acquired six Morrow Renewables operating landfill gas-to-RNG production facilities (Tomorrow RNG) located in Texas and Arkansas for total consideration of $1.3 billion (US$1.0 billion), of which $584 million (US$439 million) was paid at close and an additional deferred consideration is payable within two years with a fair value of $757 million (US$568 million) (the RNG Facilities Acquisition). The acquired assets align with and advance our lower- carbon strategy. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values that were assigned to the net assets of Tomorrow RNG: January 2, 2024 (millions of Canadian dollars) Fair value of net assets acquired: Current assets 31 Intangible assets (a) 925 Property, plant and equipment (b) 174 Current liabilities 5 Goodwill (c) 223 Purchase price: Cash 584 Deferred consideration (d): Current portion of long-term debt 550 Long-term debt 207 Other adjustments 7 1,348 a) Intangible assets consist of long-term gas supply agreements with the respective facility's landfill owner. Fair value was determined using an income-based approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, by estimating the present value of the after-tax cash flows attributable to the gas rights. The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective agreement, inclusive of extension options, which range from 13 to 42 years (approximately nine years to the next extension period on a weighted-average basis). b) Tomorrow RNG's property, plant and equipment constitutes specialized landfill gas plant and equipment which collects gas produced by waste decomposition, treats and compresses the gas to pipeline specifications. The direct method of replacement cost was used to determine the majority of the fair value of property, plant and equipment. Adjustments were then applied for estimated physical deterioration. c) Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected future returns from a portfolio of both operating and scalable RNG assets, furthering the diversity of our renewable projects portfolio and accelerating progress toward our energy transition goals. The goodwill balance recognized has been assigned to our Gas Transmission segment and is tax deductible over 15 years. 145

Page 146
d) We entered into six non-interest bearing promissory notes due to Morrow Renewables, the total value of which represents deferred payments of $808 million (US$606 million) due within two years. The first and second payments are due on January 2, 2025 and December 31, 2025, respectively. The $757 million (US$568 million) recognized in the purchase price represents the fair value of deferred consideration at the date of acquisition using the imputed interest rate method over the terms of the notes. Upon completion of the RNG Facilities Acquisition, we began consolidating Tomorrow RNG. For the period beginning January 2, 2024 through to December 31, 2024, operating revenues and earnings attributable to common shareholders generated by Tomorrow RNG were immaterial. The impact to our supplemental pro forma consolidated operating revenues and earnings attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as if the RNG Facilities Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2023, was also immaterial. Aitken Creek Gas Storage On November 1, 2023, through a wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, we acquired a 93.8% interest in Aitken Creek Gas Storage Facility and a 100% interest in Aitken Creek North Gas Storage Facility (collectively, Aitken Creek), located in BC, Canada, for $400 million (the Aitken Creek Acquisition). Aitken Creek is the only underground natural gas storage facility in BC and connects to all major natural gas pipelines in western Canada. The Aitken Creek Acquisition enables us to continue to meet regional energy needs and to support increasing demand for LNG exports. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values that were assigned to the net assets of Aitken Creek: November 1, 2023 (millions of Canadian dollars) Fair value of net assets acquired: Current assets (a) 105 Property, plant and equipment (b) 466 Current liabilities 20 Long-term liabilities (c) 130 Goodwill (d) 46 Purchase price: Cash 397 Additional consideration (e) 70 467 a) Current assets consist primarily of inventory which is short-term in nature and represents natural gas held in storage. Fair value was determined using the market price of natural gas at the date of acquisition. b) Aitken Creek's property, plant and equipment constitutes an integrated system of cavern storage facilities, associated header pipeline, and land and right-of-ways. The depreciated replacement cost approach was adopted as the primary valuation methodology to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, excluding the reservoir storage asset. In determining replacement cost, both indirect costing using relevant inflation indices and direct costing using relevant market quotes were utilized. Adjustments were then applied for physical deterioration as well as functional and economic obsolescence. 146

Page 147
Fair value of the reservoir storage asset was determined using a residual approach whereby the adjusted purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the net tangible assets, excluding the reservoir storage asset, with the remaining value allocated to the reservoir storage asset. The income approach was also utilized to corroborate that the cash flows attributable to the reservoir storage asset support the residual value. c) Long-term liabilities consist primarily of a deferred income tax liability arising from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for accounting purposes at the date of acquisition. d) Goodwill is primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred income tax liability. The goodwill balance recognized has been assigned to our Gas Transmission segment and is not tax deductible. e) The $70 million of additional consideration recognized in the purchase price represents the fair value of derivative contracts and working gas as at March 31, 2023. Upon completion of the Aitken Creek Acquisition, we began consolidating Aitken Creek. For the period beginning November 1, 2023 through to December 31, 2023, operating revenues and earnings attributable to common shareholders generated by Aitken Creek were immaterial. The impact to our supplemental pro forma consolidated operating revenues and earnings attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as if the Aitken Creek Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2022, was also immaterial. Tri Global Energy, LLC On September 27, 2022, through a wholly-owned US subsidiary, we acquired all of the outstanding common units in TGE for cash consideration of $295 million (US$215 million) plus potential contingent payments of up to $72 million (US$53 million) dependent on the achievement of performance milestones by TGE (the TGE Acquisition). TGE is an onshore renewable project developer in the US with a development portfolio of wind and solar projects. The TGE Acquisition enhances Enbridge's renewable power platform and accelerates our North American growth strategy. 147

Page 148
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values that were assigned to the net assets of TGE: September 27, 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Fair value of net assets acquired: Current assets 5 Property, plant and equipment 3 Long-term investments 8 Intangible assets (a) 117 Long-term assets 3 Current liabilities 61 Long-term debt 18 Long-term liabilities (b) 105 Goodwill (c) 392 Purchase price: Cash 295 Contingent consideration (d) 49 344 a) Intangible assets consist of compensation expected to be earned by TGE on existing development contracts once certain project development milestones are met. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow method which is an income-based approach to valuation that estimates the present value of future projected benefits from the contracts. The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life of three and a half years. b) Long-term liabilities consist primarily of obligations payable to third parties which are contingent on milestones being met for certain projects. Fair value represents the present value of the future cash flow payments at the date of the TGE Acquisition. c) Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected future returns from new opportunities to develop wind and solar projects, as well as enhanced scale and operational diversity of our renewable projects portfolio. The goodwill balance recognized has been assigned to our Renewable Power Generation segment and is tax deductible over 15 years. d) We agreed to pay additional contingent consideration of up to $72 million (US$53 million) to TGE's former common unit holders if performance milestones were met on certain projects. The $49 million (US$36 million) of contingent consideration recognized in the purchase price represents the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of acquisition. The fair value was determined using an income- based approach. Upon completion of the TGE Acquisition, we began consolidating TGE. For the period beginning September 27, 2022 through to December 31, 2022, operating revenues and earnings attributable to common shareholders generated by TGE were immaterial. The impact to our supplemental pro forma consolidated operating revenues and earnings attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as if the TGE Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2021, was also immaterial. 148

ASSET ACQUISITION Tres Palacios Holdings LLC On April 3, 2023, we acquired Tres Palacios Holdings LLC (Tres Palacios) for $451 million (US$335 million) of cash. Tres Palacios is a natural gas storage facility located in the US Gulf Coast and its infrastructure serves Texas gas-fired power generation and LNG exports, as well as Mexico pipeline exports. We allocated assets with a fair value of $790 million (US$588 million) to Property, plant and equipment, net, of which $254 million (US$189 million) relates to storage cavern right-of-use assets, and recorded the related lease liabilities of $7 million (US$5 million) and $248 million (US$184 million) to Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The acquired assets are included in our Gas Transmission segment. DISPOSITION Athabasca Regional Oil Sands System On October 5, 2022, we closed the sale of an 11.6% non-operating interest in seven pipelines in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta from our Regional Oil Sands System to Athabasca Indigenous Investments Limited Partnership (Aii), an entity representing 23 First Nation and Métis communities, for total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale and a noncontrolling interest was recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position beginning in 2022 to reflect the interest held by Aii (Note 19) . Subsequent to the sale, we maintained an 88.4% controlling interest in these assets, which are a component of our Liquids Pipelines segment, and continue to manage, operate and provide administrative services to them. 9.

IMPAIRMENT Chapman Ranch Wind Farm Chapman Ranch Wind Farm (Chapman Ranch) is experiencing financial challenges associated with the original equipment integrity. As a result, we have recognized an impairment loss of $251 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is included in Impairment of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and is part of our Renewable Power Generation segment. Magic Valley Wind Farm In 2022, Magic Valley Wind Farm (Magic Valley) had commercial challenges caused by electricity transmission congestion and a negative price differential arising from higher transmission costs resulting in a lower electricity sale price. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss of $227 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is included in Impairment of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and is part of our Renewable Power Generation segment. Bakken Pipeline System For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment loss of $183 million on the US and Canadian components of the interstate pipeline transportation system within the North Dakota System of our Bakken Pipeline System in connection with the expiration of certain long-term take-or-pay contracts in 2023. This loss is included in Impairment of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and is part of our Liquids Pipelines segment. Impairment charges were based on the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded fair value, determined using expected discounted future cash flows. 150

12. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES Our consolidated VIEs consist of legal entities where we are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary when our variable interest provides us with the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: decision-making responsibilities, the VIE capital structure, risk and rewards sharing, contractual agreements with the VIE, voting rights and level of involvement of other parties. The following table includes assets only to be used to settle liabilities of our consolidated VIEs. The creditors of the liabilities of our consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to our general credit as the primary beneficiary. These assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. December 31, 2024 2023 (millions of Canadian dollars) Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 448 442 Restricted cash 11 9 Trade receivables and unbilled revenues 138 144 Other current assets 5 8 Accounts receivable from affiliates 13 5 Inventory 13 11 628 619 Property, plant and equipment, net 6,934 7,105 Long-term investments 20 14 Restricted long-term investments and cash 141 106 Deferred amounts and other assets 145 148 Intangible assets, net 77 84 7,945 8,076 Liabilities Current liabilities Trade payables and accrued liabilities 108 83 Other current liabilities 124 145 Accounts payable to affiliates 22 4 254 232 Long-term debt — 1 Other long-term liabilities 1,133 971 Deferred income taxes 6 5 1,393 1,209 6,552 6,867 We do not have obligations to provide additional financial support to any of our consolidated VIEs. 151

Page 152
UNCONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES We also hold interests in unconsolidated VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. These interests include investments in limited partnerships that are assessed to be VIEs due to the limited partners not having substantive participating rights or kick-out rights. The power to direct the activities of a majority of these unconsolidated limited partnership VIEs is shared amongst the partners. Each partner has representatives that make up an executive committee that makes significant decisions for the VIE and none of the partners may make significant decisions unilaterally. The carrying amount of these VIEs and our estimated maximum exposure to loss as at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: Carrying Amount of Maximum Exposure to December 31, 2024 the VIE Loss (millions of Canadian dollars) Rampion Offshore Wind Limited 1 387 490 Vector Pipeline 2 193 314 Woodfibre LNG Limited Partnership 3 1,275 3,153 Whistler Parent JV 4 1,102 1,425 Other 3 168 501 3,125 5,883 Carrying Amount of Maximum Exposure to December 31, 2023 the VIE Loss (millions of Canadian dollars) Aux Sable Liquid Products L.P. 5 105 130 Rampion Offshore Wind Limited 1 391 452 Vector Pipeline 2 191 320 Woodfibre LNG Limited Partnership 3 778 2,854 Fox Squirrel Solar LLC 6 312 661 Other 3 132 230 1,909 4,647 1 As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our maximum exposure to loss includes parental guarantees that have been committed in project contracts in which we would be liable for in the event of default by the VIE and the carrying value of an affiliate dividend receivable of $73 million and nil, respectively. 2 Includes Vector Pipeline Limited Partnership in Canada and Vector Pipeline L.P. in the US. As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our maximum exposure to loss includes the carrying value of outstanding affiliate loans receivable of $16 million and $24 million, respectively, and our share of the VIE's available credit facility for $105 million. 3 As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our maximum exposure to loss includes parental guarantees and funding obligations that have been committed in connection with the projects for which we would be liable in the event of default by the VIE(s). 4 In May 2024, Enbridge formed a joint venture (the Whistler Parent JV) in which we hold a 19.0% interest. Refer to Note 13 - Long- Term Investments . As at December 31, 2024, our maximum exposure to loss includes funding obligations that have been committed in project contracts in which we would be liable for in the event of default by the VIE. 5 In April 2024, Enbridge sold its interest in Aux Sable Liquid Products L.P. Refer to Note 13 - Long-Term Investments . As at December 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss included a guarantee by us for our respective share of the VIE's borrowing on a bank credit facility. 6 In November 2023, Enbridge acquired a 50.0% interest in Fox Squirrel Solar LLC. Refer to Note 13 - Long-Term Investments . As at December 31, 2024, Fox Squirrel Solar LLC no longer met the requirements of a VIE as a result of a VIE reconsideration event. As at December 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss included parental guarantees that had been committed in project contracts in which we would be liable for in the event of default by the VIE. We do not have an obligation to and did not provide any additional financial support to our unconsolidated VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 152

OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS Joint Venture with WhiteWater/I Squared and MPLX On May 29, 2024, we formed a joint venture (the Whistler Parent JV) with WhiteWater/I Squared Capital (WhiteWater/I Squared) and MPLX LP (MPLX) that will develop, construct, own and operate natural gas pipeline and storage assets connecting Permian Basin natural gas supply to growing LNG and other US Gulf Coast demand. The Whistler Parent JV is owned by WhiteWater/I Squared (50.6%), MPLX (30.4%) and Enbridge (19.0%) and is accounted for as an equity method investment. In connection with the formation of the Whistler Parent JV, we contributed our 100% interest in the Rio Bravo Pipeline project and $487 million (US$357 million) of cash to the Whistler Parent JV. In addition to our 19.0% equity interest in the Whistler Parent JV, we received a special equity interest in the Whistler Parent JV which provides for a 25.0% economic interest in the Rio Bravo Pipeline project. This interest is subject to certain redemption rights held by Whitewater/I Squared and MPLX. After the closing on May 29, 2024, we accrued for our share of the post-closing mandatory capital expenditures of approximately US$150 million for the Rio Bravo Pipeline project. Additional capital expenditures to complete the Rio Bravo Pipeline project will be proportionate to our economic interest. The contribution of our interest in the Rio Bravo Pipeline project to the Whistler Parent JV in exchange for the equity interests discussed above represents a non-cash transaction in Cash Flows from Investing Activities and does not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This component of the transaction resulted in a reduction of $321 million (US$235 million) to Property, plant and equipment, net and a corresponding increase to Long-term investments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The cash component of the transaction, as well as subsequent cash payments made for post- closing mandatory capital expenditures, have been reflected as contributions in Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Fox Squirrel Solar LLC On November 15, 2023, we acquired a 50.0% interest in a newly formed partnership with EDF Renewables North America to participate in the initial phase of a solar power facility in Ohio. Cash consideration included an upfront payment of $157 million (US$115 million) with subsequent capital contributions of $591 million (US$426 million), for all phases of construction, made at the project's in- service dates. Hohe See and Albatros Offshore Wind Facilities On November 3, 2023, we acquired an additional 24.45% interest in the Hohe See Offshore Wind Facilities and Albatros Offshore Wind Facilities (the Offshore Wind Facilities), through the acquisition of a 49.0% interest in Enbridge Renewable Infrastructure Investments S.à r.l (ERII), for $391 million (€267 million) of cash and assumed debt of $524 million (€358 million), bringing our interest in the Offshore Wind Facilities to 49.9%. The Hohe See Offshore Wind Facilities and Albatros Offshore Wind Facilities are located approximately 100 kilometers off the northern coast of Germany and came into service in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Subsequent to the purchase, our interest in ERII is consolidated and our interest in the Offshore Wind Facilities will continue to be accounted for as an equity method investment included in the Renewable Power Generation segment. 155

DCP Midstream, LLC On August 17, 2022, we completed a joint venture merger transaction with Phillips 66 resulting in a single joint venture, DCP Midstream, LLC, holding both our and Phillips 66's indirect ownership interests in Gray Oak and DCP. Our ownership in DCP Midstream, LLC consists of Class A and Class B Interests which track to our investments in DCP, included in the Gas Transmission segment, and Gray Oak, included in the Liquids Pipelines segment, respectively. Through our investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, we increased our effective economic interest in Gray Oak to 58.5% from 22.8% and reduced our effective economic interest in DCP to 13.2% from 28.3%. As a result of the transaction, Enbridge assumed operatorship of Gray Oak in the second quarter of 2023. We determined the fair value of our decrease in economic interest in DCP based on the unadjusted quoted market price of DCP's publicly traded common units on the transaction closing date. The fair value of our increased economic interest in Gray Oak was determined using the fair value prescribed to the change in our economic interest in DCP. As a result of the merger transaction and the realignment of our economic interests in DCP and Gray Oak, we also received cash consideration of approximately $522 million (US$404 million) and recorded an accounting gain of $1.1 billion (US$832 million) to Gain on joint venture merger transaction in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Both DCP and Gray Oak continue to be accounted for as equity method investments. 14.

With the exception of Preference Shares, Series A, such fixed dividend rate resets every five years beginning on the initial Redemption and Conversion Option Date. Preference Shares, Series G, Series I and Series 4 contain a feature where the dividend rate resets on a quarterly basis. These Dividend Rates are presented in the table above on an annualized basis using the most recent quarterly dividend rate reset. The Preference Shares, Series 19 contain a feature where the fixed dividend rate, when reset every five years, will not be less than 4.90%. No other series of preference shares has this feature. 2 Preference Shares, Series A may be redeemed any time at our option. For all other series of preference shares, we may at our option, redeem all or a portion of the outstanding preference shares for the Per Share Base Redemption Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Redemption Option Date and on every fifth anniversary thereafter. 3 The holder will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to convert their shares into Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares of a specified series on a one-for-one basis on the Conversion Option Date and every fifth anniversary thereafter at an ascribed issue price equal to the Per Share Base Redemption Value. 4 With the exception of Preference Shares, Series A, after the Redemption and Conversion Option Date, holders may elect to receive quarterly floating rate cumulative dividends per share at a rate equal to: $25 x (number of days in quarter/number of days in year) x three month Government of Canada treasury bill rate + 2.4% (Series C), 2.4% (Series E), 2.5% (Series G), 2.1% (Series I), 2.7% (Series O), 2.5% (Series Q), 2.5% (Series S), 2.4% (Series 4), 2.6% (Series 8), 2.7% (Series 10), 2.6% (Series 12), 2.7% (Series 14), 2.7% (Series 16), or 3.2% (Series 20); or US$25 x (number of days in quarter/number of days in year) x three month US Government treasury bill rate + 3.2% (Series M), 3.1% (Series 2), or 2.8% (Series 6). 5 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series G was decreased to $0.37911 from $0.43014 on December 1, 2024 due to reset on a quarterly basis. 6 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series I was decreased to $0.35507 from $0.40589 on December 1, 2024 due to reset on a quarterly basis. 7 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series P was increased to $0.36988 from $0.27369 on March 1, 2024 due to reset of the annual dividend on March 1, 2024. 8 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series R was increased to $0.39463 from $0.25456 on June 1, 2024 due to reset of the annual dividend on June 1, 2024. 9 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series 3 was increased to $0.33050 from $0.23356 on September 1, 2024 due to reset of the annual dividend on September 1, 2024. 10 On September 1, 2024, 1,502,775 of the outstanding Preference Shares, Series 3 were converted into Preference Shares, Series 4. The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series 4 was decreased to $0.37110 from $0.42206 on December 1, 2024 due to reset on a quarterly basis following the date of issuance. 11 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series 5 was increased to US$0.41769 from US$0.33596 on March 1, 2024 due to reset of the annual dividend on March 1, 2024. 12 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series 7 was increased to $0.37425 from $0.27806 on March 1, 2024 due to reset of the annual dividend on March 1, 2024. 13 The quarterly dividend per share paid on Preference Shares, Series 9 was increased to $0.35450 from $0.25606 on December 1, 2024 due to reset of the annual dividend on December 1, 2024. 165

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN The Shareholder Rights Plan is designed to encourage the fair treatment of our shareholders in connection with any takeover offer. Rights issued under the plan become exercisable when a person and any related parties acquires or announces its intention to acquire 20% or more of our outstanding common shares without complying with certain provisions set out in the plan or without approval of our Board of Directors. Should such an acquisition occur, each rights holder, other than the acquiring person and related parties, will have the right to purchase our common shares at a 50% discount to the market price at that time. 21. STOCK OPTION AND STOCK UNIT PLANS We maintain three primary vehicles under our long-term incentive plan (the Plan): ISOs, PSUs and RSUs. Total stock-based compensation expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $186 million, $154 million and $260 million, respectively. The number of common shares authorized for share-settled awards under the Plan was 181 million as at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS Certain key employees are granted ISOs to purchase common shares at the grant date market price. ISOs vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period and expire 10 years after the issue date.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine the fair value of ISOs granted using the Black- Scholes-Merton model are as follows: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Fair value per option (Canadian dollars) 1 4.07 6.05 5.07 Valuation assumptions Expected option term (years) 2 6 6 6 Expected volatility 3 21.1% 22.2% 21.9% Expected dividend yield 4 8.1% 6.7% 6.5% Risk-free interest rate 5 3.8% 3.5% 1.8% 1 Options granted to US employees are based on the NYSE prices. The option value and assumptions shown are based on a weighted average of the US and Canadian options. The fair value per option for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $3.53, $5.38 and $4.78, respectively, for Canadian employees and US$3.58, US$5.23 and US$4.62, respectively, for US employees. 2 The expected option term is six years based on historical exercise practice and five years for retirement eligible employees. 3 Expected volatility is determined with reference to historic daily share price volatility and consideration of the implied volatility observable in call option values near the grant date. 4 The expected dividend yield is the current annual dividend at the grant date divided by the current stock price. 5 The risk-free interest rate is based on the Government of Canada's Canadian bond yields and the US Treasury bond yields at the grant date. Compensation expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for ISOs was $19 million, $18 million and $15 million, respectively. As at December 31, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested ISOs was $12 million. The expense is expected to be fully recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years. PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS PSUs are granted to certain key employees where cash awards are paid following a three-year performance cycle. Awards are calculated by multiplying the number of units outstanding at the end of the performance period by Enbridge's weighted average share price for 20 days prior to the maturity of the grant and by a performance multiplier. The performance multiplier ranges from zero, if our performance fails to meet threshold performance levels, to a maximum of 2.0 if we perform within the highest range of the performance targets. The performance multiplier is derived through a calculation of our Total Shareholder Return percentile rank relative to a specified peer group of companies and our distributable cash flow per share, adjusted for unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, relative to targets established at the time of grant. Beginning with the 2023 grant, the performance multiplier also includes a greenhouse gas reduction component. To calculate the 2024 expense, a multiplier of 1.38 was used for 2024 PSU grants, 1.1 for 2023 PSU grants and 1.0 for 2022 PSU grants.

Compensation expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for PSUs was $75 million, $59 million and $169 million, respectively. As at December 31, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs was $109 million. The expense is expected to be fully recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS Employees may also be granted cash-settled or share-settled RSUs under the Plan.Share-settled awards granted to non-executive senior management employees vest following a three-year maturity period. Beginning in 2023, share-settled units were also granted to non-executive employees. These units vest either on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, or following a 12-month period. Cash-settled RSUs are given to non-executive employees and are paid in equal installments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. RSU holders receive cash or shares equal to Enbridge's weighted average share price for 20 days prior to the maturity of the grant multiplied by the number of units outstanding on the maturity date.

Compensation expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for RSUs was $92 million, $77 million and $76 million, respectively. As at December 31, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSUs was $67 million. The expense is expected to be fully recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one year. 168

RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows and OCI are subject to movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and our share price (collectively, market risk). Formal risk management policies, processes and systems have been designed to mitigate these risks. The following summarizes the types of market risks to which we are exposed and the risk management instruments used to mitigate them. We use a combination of qualifying and non-qualifying derivative instruments to manage the risks noted below. Foreign Exchange Risk We generate certain revenues, incur expenses and hold a number of investments and subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than Canadian dollars. As a result, our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variability. We employ financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency-denominated earnings exposure. A combination of qualifying and non-qualifying derivative instruments is used to hedge anticipated foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses and to manage variability in cash flows. We hedge certain net investments in US dollar-denominated investments and subsidiaries using US dollar-denominated debt. 170

Page 171
Interest Rate Risk Our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to short-term interest rate variability due to the regular repricing of our variable rate debt, primarily commercial paper. We have a policy of limiting our maximum floating rate debt to 30% of total debt outstanding. To ensure compliance with our policy, we monitor and adjust our debt portfolio mix of fixed and variable rate debt instruments in conjunction with the use of derivative instruments. We have implemented a program to partially mitigate the impact of short-term interest rate volatility on interest expense via the execution of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps and costless collars. These swaps have an average fixed rate of 3.6%. Our earnings and cash flows are also exposed to variability in longer term interest rates ahead of anticipated fixed rate term debt issuances. A combination of qualifying and non-qualifying forward starting interest rate swaps is used to hedge against the effect of future interest rate movements. We have established a program including some of our subsidiaries to partially mitigate our exposure to long-term interest rate variability on forecasted term debt issuances via execution of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps with an average swap rate of 3.4%. Commodity Price Risk Our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to changes in commodity prices as a result of our ownership interests in certain assets and investments, as well as through the activities of our energy marketing subsidiaries. These commodities include natural gas, crude oil, power and NGL. We employ financial and physical derivative instruments to fix a portion of the variable price exposures that arise from physical transactions involving these commodities. We use primarily non-qualifying derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk. Equity Price Risk Equity price risk is the risk of earnings fluctuations due to changes in our share price. We have exposure to our own common share price through the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation, which affect earnings through the revaluation of outstanding units every period. TOTAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We have a policy of entering into individual International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements, or other similar derivative agreements, with the majority of our derivative counterparties. These agreements provide for the net settlement of derivative instruments outstanding with specific counterparties in the event of bankruptcy or other significant credit events and reduce our credit risk exposure on financial derivative asset positions in those circumstances. The following table summarizes the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position location and carrying value of our derivative instruments, as well as the maximum potential settlement amounts, in the event of the specific circumstances described above. 171

The Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income The following table presents the effect of cash flow hedges and fair value hedges on our consolidated earnings and comprehensive income, before the effect of income taxes: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Amount of unrealized gain/(loss) recognized in OCI Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange contracts — — 3 Interest rate contracts 67 201 1,151 Commodity contracts 19 68 (53) Other contracts 1 (2) (4) Fair value hedges Foreign exchange contracts (42) 15 (35) 45 282 1,062 Amount of (income)/loss reclassified from AOCI to earnings Foreign exchange contracts 1 53 — 13 Interest rate contracts 2 31 28 186 Commodity contracts 3 (1) — — Other contracts 4 — — 4 83 28 203 1 Reported within Interest expense and Other income/(expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 2 Reported within Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 3 Reported within Transportation and other services revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 4 Reported within Operating and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We estimate that no amounts from AOCI related to open cash flow hedges will be reclassified to earnings in the next 12 months. Actual amounts reclassified to earnings depend on the foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. For all forecasted transactions, the maximum term over which we are hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows is two years as at December 31, 2024. Non-Qualifying Derivatives The following table presents the unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of our non-qualifying derivatives: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars) Foreign exchange contracts 1 (2,033) 1,292 (1,344) Interest rate contracts 2 112 (63) 10 Commodity contracts 3 (163) (41) 50 Other contracts 4 2 (8) 4 Total unrealized derivative fair value gain/(loss), net (2,082) 1,180 (1,280) 1 For the respective years ended, reported within Transportation and other services revenues (2024 - nil ; 2023 - $645 million gain; 2022 - $238 million loss) and Other income/(expense) (2024 - $2,033 million loss; 2023 - $647 million gain; 2022 - $1,106 million loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 2 Reported within Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 3 For the respective years ended, reported within Transportation and other services revenues (2024 - $23 million loss; 2023 - $35 million loss; 2022 - $13 million gain), Commodity sales (2024 - $92 million loss; 2023 - $153 million gain; 2022 - $89 million gain), Commodity costs (2024 - $31 million loss; 2023 - $94 million loss; 2022 - $102 million loss) and Operating and administrative expense (2024 - $17 million loss; 2023 - $65 million loss; 2022 - $50 million gain) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 4 Reported within Operating and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 175

LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations, including commitments and guarantees, as they become due. In order to mitigate this risk, we forecast cash requirements over a 12-month rolling time period to determine whether sufficient funds will be available. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are funds generated from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and draws under committed credit facilities and long-term debt, which includes debentures and medium- term notes. Our shelf prospectuses with securities regulators enable ready access to either the Canadian or US public capital markets, subject to market conditions. In addition, we maintain sufficient liquidity through committed credit facilities with a diversified group of banks and institutions which, if necessary, enables us to fund all anticipated requirements for approximately one year without accessing the capital markets. We were in compliance with all the terms and conditions of our committed credit facility agreements and term debt indentures as at December 31, 2024. As a result, all credit facilities are available to us and the banks are obligated to fund us under the terms of the facilities. We also identify other potential sources of debt and equity funding alternatives, including reinstatement of our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan or at-the-market equity issuances. CREDIT RISK Entering into derivative instruments may result in exposure to credit risk from the possibility that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, we enter into risk management transactions primarily with institutions that possess strong investment grade credit ratings. Credit risk relating to derivative counterparties is mitigated through the maintenance and monitoring of credit exposure limits, contractual requirements and netting arrangements. We also review counterparty credit exposure using external credit rating services and other analytical tools to manage credit risk. We have credit concentrations and credit exposure, with respect to derivative instruments, in the following counterparty segments: December 31, 2024 2023 (millions of Canadian dollars) Canadian financial institutions 344 457 US financial institutions 128 252 European financial institutions 116 107 Asian financial institutions 53 121 Other 1 332 125 973 1,062 1 Other is comprised of commodity clearing house and crude oil, natural gas and power counterparties. As at December 31, 2024, we did not provide any letters of credit in lieu of providing cash collateral to our counterparties pursuant to the terms of the relevant ISDA agreements. We held no cash collateral on derivative asset exposures as at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Gross derivative balances have been presented without the effects of collateral posted. Derivative assets are adjusted for non-performance risk of our counterparties using their credit default swap spread rates and are reflected at fair value. For derivative liabilities, our non-performance risk is considered in the valuation. 176

Page 177
Credit risk also arises from trade and other long-term receivables, and is mitigated through credit exposure limits and contractual requirements, the assessment of counterparty credit ratings and netting arrangements. Within the Gas Distribution and Storage segment, credit risk is mitigated by the utility's large and diversified customer base and the ability to recover expected credit losses through the ratemaking process. We actively monitor the financial strength of large industrial customers and, in select cases, have obtained additional security to minimize the risk of default on receivables. Generally, we utilize a loss allowance matrix which contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations to measure lifetime expected credit losses of receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk related to non-derivative financial assets is their carrying value. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include derivatives and other financial instruments. We also disclose the fair value of other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The fair value of financial instruments reflects our best estimates of market value based on generally accepted valuation techniques or models and is supported by observable market prices and rates. When such values are not available, we use discounted cash flow analysis from applicable yield curves based on observable market inputs to estimate fair value. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We categorize our financial instruments measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 Level 1 includes financial instruments measured at fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. An active market for a financial instrument is considered to be a market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1. Our Level 1 instruments consist primarily of exchange-traded derivatives used to mitigate the risk of crude oil price fluctuations, US and Canadian treasury bills, and investments in exchange-traded funds held by our captive insurance subsidiaries. We also hold restricted long-term investments in exchange-traded funds and common shares in trusts in accordance with the CER's regulatory requirements under the LMCI and to cover future pipeline decommissioning costs in the state of Minnesota. Level 2 Level 2 includes financial instrument valuations determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Financial instruments in this category are valued using models or other industry standard valuation techniques derived from observable market data. Such valuation techniques include inputs such as quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors and broker quotes that can be observed or corroborated in the market for the entire duration of the financial instrument. Derivatives valued using Level 2 inputs include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts, interest rate swaps, physical forward commodity contracts, as well as commodity swaps and options for which observable inputs can be obtained. We have also categorized the fair value of our long-term debt, investments in debt securities held by our captive insurance subsidiaries, and restricted long-term investments in Canadian government bonds held in trust in accordance with the CER's regulatory requirements under the LMCI as Level 2. The fair value of our long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for instruments of similar credit risk and tenor. When possible, the fair value of our restricted long-term investments is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments and, if not available, based on broker quotes. 177

Page 178
Level 3 Level 3 includes derivative valuations based on inputs which are less observable, unavailable or where the observable data does not support a significant portion of the derivative's fair value. Generally, Level 3 derivatives are longer dated transactions, occur in less active markets, occur at locations where pricing information is not available or have no binding broker quote to support Level 2 classification. We have developed methodologies, benchmarked against industry standards, to determine fair value for these derivatives based on the extrapolation of observable future prices and rates. Derivatives valued using Level 3 inputs primarily include long-dated derivative power, NGL and natural gas contracts, basis swaps, commodity swaps, and power and energy swaps, physical forward commodity contracts, as well as options. We do not have any other financial instruments categorized in Level 3. We use the most observable inputs available to estimate the fair value of our derivatives. When possible, we estimate the fair value of our derivatives based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, we use estimates from third-party brokers. For non-exchange traded derivatives classified in Levels 2 and 3, we use standard valuation techniques to calculate the estimated fair value. These methods include discounted cash flows for forwards and swaps and Black-Scholes-Merton pricing models for options. Depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying risk, we use observable market prices (interest, foreign exchange, commodity and share price) and volatility as primary inputs to these valuation techniques. Finally, we consider our own credit default swap spread, as well as the credit default swap spreads associated with our counterparties, in our estimation of fair value. 178

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 derivative instruments were as follows: December 31, 2024 Fair Value Unobservable Input Minimum Price/ Volatility Maximum Price/ Volatility Weighted Average Price/Volatility Unit of Measurement (fair value in millions of Canadian dollars) Commodity contracts - financial 1 Natural gas (5) Forward gas price 3.73 9.85 4.12 $/mmbtu 2 Crude (13) Forward crude price 73.54 104.42 97.44 $/barrel Power (44) Forward power price 31.17 229.29 68.51 $/MW/H Commodity contracts - physical 1 Natural gas (80) Forward gas price 1.40 22.57 4.12 $/mmbtu 2 Crude 22 Forward crude price 77.31 118.28 99.76 $/barrel Power (98) Forward power price 12.94 211.42 70.30 $/MW/H Commodity options 3 Natural gas 166 Forward gas price 2.44 7.09 4.44 $/mmbtu 2 Price volatility 3% 77% 50% (52) 1 Financial and physical forward commodity contracts are valued using a market approach valuation technique. 2 One million British thermal units (mmbtu). 3 Commodity options contracts are valued using an option model valuation technique. If adjusted, the significant unobservable inputs disclosed in the table above would have a direct impact on the fair value of our Level 3 derivative instruments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 derivative instruments include forward commodity prices. Changes in forward commodity prices could result in significantly different fair values for our Level 3 derivatives. Changes in the net fair value of derivative assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 (millions of Canadian dollars) Level 3 net derivative liability at beginning of year (131) (136) Total gain/(loss), unrealized Included in earnings 1 (92) (48) Included in OCI 19 67 Included in regulatory assets/liabilities 130 — Settlements 22 (14) Level 3 net derivative liability at end of year (52) (131) 1 Reported within Transportation and other services revenues, Commodity costs and Operating and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 as at December 31, 2024 or 2023. Net Investment Hedges We currently have designated a portion of our US dollar-denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in US dollar-denominated investments and subsidiaries. 181

Page 182
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized foreign exchange losses of $1,185 million and gains of $645 million, respectively, on the translation of US dollar- denominated debt, in OCI. No unrealized gains or losses on the change in fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts were recognized in OCI during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. No realized gains or losses associated with the settlement of foreign exchange forward contracts were recognized in OCI during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized realized losses of $120 million and losses of $236 million, respectively, associated with the settlement of US dollar-denominated debt that had matured during the period, in OCI. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments Certain long-term investments in other entities with no actively quoted prices are classified as FVMA investments and are recorded at cost less impairment. The carrying value of FVMA investments totaled $187 million and $173 million as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries whose principal activity is providing insurance and reinsurance coverage for certain insurable property and casualty risk exposures of our operating subsidiaries and certain equity investments. As at December 31, 2024, the fair value of investments in equity funds and debt securities held by our captive insurance subsidiaries was $114 million and $1.1 billion, respectively (2023 - $287 million and $284 million, respectively). Our investments in debt securities had a cost basis of $1.1 billion as at December 31, 2024 (2023 - $279 million). These investments in equity funds and debt securities are recognized at fair value, classified as Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, respectively, and are recorded in Other current assets and Long-term investments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. There were unrealized holding losses of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 (2023 - gains of $34 million). As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our long-term debt had a carrying value of $101.6 billion and $81.2 billion, respectively, before debt issuance costs and a fair value of $98.9 billion and $78.1 billion, respectively. As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had investments with a fair value of $998 million and $717 million, respectively, included in Restricted long-term investments and cash in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position which are classified as available-for-sale. These securities represent restricted funds held in trust for the purpose of funding pipeline abandonment in accordance with the CER's regulatory requirements, to cover future pipeline decommissioning costs in the state of Minnesota and to satisfy retirement obligations as Wexpro properties are abandoned. We had restricted long-term investments and cash held in trust totaling $491 million and $263 million as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. We also had restricted long-term investments held in trust totaling $507 million (cost basis - $540 million) and $454 million (cost basis - $486 million) as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. There were unrealized holding gains of $33 million and $51 million on these investments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Within Other long-term liabilities we had estimated future abandonment costs related to LMCI of $826 million and $745 million as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively (Note 7) . The fair value of financial assets and liabilities other than derivative instruments, certain long-term investments in other entities, restricted long-term investments, investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries and long-term debt described above approximate their carrying value due to the short period to maturity. 182

As at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized the benefit of unused tax loss carryforwards of $1.3 billion in Canada which expire in 2031 and beyond. As at December 31, 2024, and 2023, we recognized the benefit of unused tax loss carryforwards of $4.2 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, in the US with no expiration. We have not provided for deferred income taxes on the difference between the carrying value of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries and their corresponding tax basis as the earnings of those subsidiaries are intended to be permanently reinvested in their operations. As such, these investments are not anticipated to give rise to income taxes in the foreseeable future. The difference between the carrying values of the investments and their tax bases is largely a result of unremitted earnings and currency translation adjustments. The unremitted earnings and currency translation adjustment for which no deferred taxes have been recognized in respect of foreign subsidiaries were $9.5 billion and $6.6 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If such earnings are remitted, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities applicable to such amounts is not practicable. Enbridge and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to taxation in Canada, the US and other foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examinations include the US (Federal) and Canada (Federal, Alberta and Québec). We are open to examination by Canadian tax authorities for the 2017 to 2024 tax years and by US tax authorities for the 2021 to 2024 tax years. We are currently under examination for income tax matters in Canada for the 2018 to 2021 tax years. We are not currently under examination for income tax matters in any other material jurisdiction where we are subject to income tax. UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 (millions of Canadian dollars) Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year 45 55 Gross decreases for tax positions of prior year (2) (2) Change in translation of foreign currency 4 (1) Lapses of statute of limitations (16) (7) Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year 31 45 The unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2024, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. We do not anticipate further adjustments to the unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes. Interest and penalties included in income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $8 million recovery and $1 million expense, respectively. As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, interest and penalties of $6 million and $14 million, respectively, have been accrued. 25. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PENSION PLANS We sponsor Canadian and US contributory and non-contributory registered defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, which provide benefits covering substantially all employees. The Canadian pension plans provide defined benefit and defined contribution pension benefits to our Canadian employees. The US pension plans provide defined benefit pension benefits to our US employees. We also sponsor supplemental non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, which provide non-registered benefits for certain employees in Canada and the US. 185

Page 186
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Benefits Benefits payable from the defined benefit pension plans are based on each plan participant's years of service and final average remuneration. Some benefits are partially inflation-indexed after a plan participant’s retirement. Our contributions are made in accordance with independent actuarial valuations. Participant contributions to contributory defined benefit pension plans are based upon each plan participant's current eligible remuneration. Defined Contribution Pension Plan Benefits Our contributions are based on each plan participant's current eligible remuneration. Our contributions for some defined contribution pension plans are also based on age and years of service. Our defined contribution pension benefit costs are equal to the amount of contributions required to be made by us. Benefit Obligations, Plan Assets and Funded Status The following table details the changes in the projected benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets and the recorded assets or liabilities for our defined benefit pension plans: Canada US December 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (millions of Canadian dollars) Change in projected benefit obligation Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year 4,092 3,630 1,036 1,029 Service cost 103 81 60 40 Interest cost 186 184 69 47 Participant contributions 32 31 — — Actuarial (gain)/loss 1 — 359 (98) 31 Benefits paid (210) (193) (100) (76) Transfer in — — 569 — Foreign currency exchange rate changes — — 119 (29) Other — — (7) (6) Projected benefit obligation at end of year 2 4,203 4,092 1,648 1,036 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 4,528 4,234 1,052 1,080 Actual return on plan assets 627 427 197 78 Employer contributions 23 27 5 5 Participant contributions 32 31 — — Benefits paid (210) (193) (100) (76) Transfer in — — 900 — Foreign currency exchange rate changes — — 146 (29) Other — 2 (6) (6) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 3 5,000 4,528 2,194 1,052 Overfunded status at end of year 797 436 546 16 Presented as follows: Deferred amounts and other assets 943 636 653 116 Other current liabilities (10) (8) (6) (5) Other long-term liabilities (136) (192) (101) (95) 797 436 546 16 1 Primarily due to the increase in the discount rate and changes in benefit assumptions and member data used to measure the defined benefit obligations (2023 - primarily due to the decrease in the discount rates used to measure the benefit obligation). 2 The accumulated benefit obligation for our Canadian pension plans was $3.9 billion and $3.8 billion as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for our US pension plans was $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 3 Assets in the amount of $18 million (2023 - $14 million) and $80 million (2023 - $62 million), related to our Canadian and US non- registered supplemental pension plan obligations, respectively, are held in grantor trusts and rabbi trusts that, in accordance with federal tax regulations, are not restricted from creditors. These assets are committed for the future settlement of benefit obligations included in the underfunded status as at the end of the year, however they are excluded from plan assets for accounting purposes. 186

PLAN ASSETS We manage the investment risk of our pension funds by setting a long-term asset mix policy for each plan after consideration of: (i) the nature of pension plan liabilities; (ii) the investment horizon of the plan; (iii) the going concern and solvency funded status and cash flow requirements of the plan; (iv) our operating environment and financial situation and our ability to withstand fluctuations in pension contributions; and (v) the future economic and capital markets outlook with respect to investment returns, volatility of returns and correlation between assets. The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the asset allocation targets with estimates for returns based on long-term expectations. 190

Page 191
The asset allocation targets and major categories of plan assets are as follows: Canada US Target December 31, Target December 31, Asset Category Allocation 2024 2023 Allocation 2024 2023 Equity securities 46.2% 39.1% 41.4% 43.4% 44.8% 39.5% Fixed income securities 23.0% 31.6% 29.6% 23.2% 33.0% 19.4% Alternatives 1 30.8% 29.3% 29.0% 33.4% 22.2% 41.1% 1 Alternatives include investments in private debt, private equity, infrastructure and real estate funds. Fund values are based on the net asset value of the funds that invest directly in the aforementioned underlying investments. The values of the investments have been estimated using the capital accounts representing the plan's ownership interest in the funds.

ENVIRONMENTAL We are subject to various Canadian and US federal, provincial/state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on us. Environmental risk is inherent to liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas pipeline operations, and Enbridge and its affiliates are, at times, subject to environmental remediation obligations at various sites where we operate. We manage this environmental risk through appropriate environmental policies, programs and practices to minimize any impact our operations may have on the environment. To the extent that we are unable to recover payment for environmental liabilities from insurance or other potentially responsible parties, we will be responsible for payment of costs arising from environmental incidents associated with our operating activities. OTHER LITIGATION We and our subsidiaries are subject to various other legal and regulatory actions and proceedings which arise in the normal course of business, including interventions in regulatory proceedings and challenges to regulatory approvals and permits. While the final outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of such actions and proceedings will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. TAX MATTERS We and our subsidiaries maintain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. While fully supportable in our view, these tax positions, if challenged by tax authorities, may not be fully sustained on review. INSURANCE We maintain an insurance program for us, our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates to mitigate a certain portion of our risks. However, not all potential risks arising from our operations are insurable, or are insured by us as a result of availability, high premiums and for various other reasons. We self-insure a significant portion of certain risks through our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, which require certain assumptions and management judgment regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices and the selection of estimated loss among estimates derived using different methods. Our insurance coverage is also subject to terms and conditions, exclusions and large deductibles or self-insured retentions which may reduce or eliminate coverage in certain circumstances. Our insurance policies are generally renewed on an annual basis and, depending on factors such as market conditions, the premiums, terms, policy limits and/or deductibles can vary substantially. We can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates or on other terms we consider commercially reasonable. In such case, we may decide to self-insure additional risks. In the unlikely event multiple insurable incidents occur which exceed coverage limits within the same insurance period, the total insurance coverage will be allocated among entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement we have entered into with us and other subsidiaries. 197

31. GUARANTEES In the normal course of conducting business, we may enter into agreements which indemnify third parties and affiliates. We may also be a party to agreements with subsidiaries, jointly owned entities, unconsolidated entities such as equity method investees, or entities with other ownership arrangements that require us to provide financial and performance guarantees. Financial guarantees include stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. To varying degrees, these guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not included in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Performance guarantees require us to make payments to a third party if the guaranteed entity does not perform on its contractual obligations, such as debt agreements, purchase or sale agreements, and construction contracts and leases. We typically enter into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. Examples include indemnifying counterparties pursuant to sale agreements for assets or businesses in matters such as breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, loss or damages to property, environmental liabilities, and litigation and contingent liabilities. We may indemnify third parties for certain liabilities relating to environmental matters arising from operations prior to the purchase or transfer of certain assets and interests. Similarly, we may indemnify the purchaser of assets for certain tax liabilities incurred while we owned the assets, a misrepresentation related to taxes that result in a loss to the purchaser or other certain tax liabilities related to those assets. The likelihood of having to perform under these guarantees and indemnifications is largely dependent upon future operations of various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. We cannot reasonably estimate the total maximum potential amounts that could become payable to third parties and affiliates under such agreements described above; however, historically, we have not made any significant payments under guarantee or indemnification provisions. While these agreements may specify a maximum potential exposure, or a specified duration to the guarantee or indemnification obligation, there are circumstances where the amount and duration are unlimited. As at December 31, 2024, guarantees and indemnifications have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, earnings, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 198

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed with, or submitted to, securities regulatory authorities is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under Canadian and US securities law. As at December 31, 2024, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file with or submit to the SEC and the Canadian Securities Administrators is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in the rules of the SEC and the Canadian Securities Administrators. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of executive and financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements because of inherent limitations. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with our policies and procedures. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024, based on the framework established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024. 200

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired The East Ohio Gas Company, Questar Gas Company and its related Wexpro entities, and the Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated. As permitted by the SEC, we excluded these acquisitions from our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024 because we acquired them in separate business combinations during 2024. Total assets and total revenues of The East Ohio Gas Company, Questar Gas Company and its related Wexpro entities, and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated combined represented approximately 11% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm appointed by our shareholders. As stated in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm which appears in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , they expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the three months ended December 31, 2024, there has been no material change in our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TRADING ARRANGEMENTS Certain of our officers and directors have made elections to participate in, and are participating in, our compensation and benefit plans involving Enbridge stock, such as our 401(k) plan and directors’ compensation plan, and may from time to time make elections which may be designed to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act or may constitute non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).

Folks, I'm really proud of the Enbridge team for all its achievements in 2023. We met our financial guidance for the 18th straight year and once again exceeded the midpoint for both EBITDA and DCF per share, demonstrating the low-risk predictable nature of our business. Sustainably returning capital to shareholders remains a key priority, and our investors are benefiting from that as we increased our dividend by 3.1% this year, marking our 29th consecutive annual increase. Our debt to EBITDA, including the prefunding, was 4.1x, leaving ample balance sheet room in preparation for the closing of the U.S. gas utility acquisitions in 2024. In addition to the outstanding financial performance, we had an equally impressive year operationally. Enbridge employees matched our best-ever company safety performance. We had high utilization rates across our systems and set record throughputs on the mainline, Gray Oak and at our Ingleside export facility. We also concluded open seasons on Flanagan South, southern Lights and Algonquin gas pipeline and are about to initiate an open season for the expanded capacity on Gray Oak Pipeline, which we expect to be very positively received. On the execution front, we filed with the unanimous customer approval, the mainline tolling agreement with the Canadian Energy Regulator and expect approval in the coming months. The settlement we filed is consistent with the terms we outlined for you in May and is a win-win-win for the customers, for industry and for Enbridge, and I'll touch on that more later in the presentation. The sale of our interest in Alliance and Aux Sable continues our track record of recycling capital at the attractive multiples and put us in a position where we have largely completed the funding for utility acquisitions. I'm extremely proud of the organic growth projects we announced in 2023, securing an additional $10 billion to our growth backlog, which will help to drive low-risk returns to shareholders for years to come. We announced the acquisition of 3 gas utilities, which will create the largest integrated gas utility in North America as well as several accretive tuck-in acquisitions in other business units. These transactions will enhance our service offering to customers and blend and extend our growth for years to come. Lastly, we placed over $2 billion of growth capital into service, primarily through our GTM modernization and utility growth capital programs. Of course, sustainability continues to be a key component of our license to operate. Last May, we published our 22nd annual sustainability report, which highlights our industry-leading performance on environmental, social and governance issues as well as progress on our Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan. Today, I'm pleased to report that we've already met 10 of those commitments with continued efforts on the remaining elements. When it comes to emission reductions, our approach continues to be leading edge, not bleeding edge. And our recent R&D investments as well as the Ingleside blue ammonia project we're partnering with Yara, are strategically aligned with this philosophy. Before I move on to the business, I want to take a moment to highlight our record financial performance. 2023 EBITDA is up 6% from last year, primarily due to the strong performance from our Liquids business unit. DCF per share is up 1% even after absorbing the dilution impact from the upfront $4.6 billion equity issuance in September to finance the utility acquisitions. And our balance sheet is well positioned ahead of the closings of the gas utilities at 4.1x debt to EBITDA. Altogether, another excellent year of financial performance ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and in line with our multiyear outlook. Pat will walk you through the main drivers of the strong fourth quarter shortly. As we reflect on 2023, I want to remind everyone why our business is a first-choice investment opportunity. Our assets generate strong, reliable and growing cash flows that are underpinned by low-risk, commercial frameworks and a stable balance sheet. We consistently and sustainably return capital to shareholders and late last year announced our 29th consecutive annual dividend increase. 2023 was a hallmark year for growth at Enbridge with approximately $23 billion of announced acquisitions and $10 billion of new projects adding both 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

greater visibility and duration to our growth outlook. And consistent with our vision, we continue to develop Enbridge's lower carbon strategy, benefiting the enterprise and supporting an appropriately paced global energy transition. Enbridge is operating from a position of strength and its predictable cash flow growth, low business risk and strong total return profile makes it a first-choice investment opportunity. So let's take a minute and revisit the low-risk nature of Enbridge's businesses. As I mentioned earlier, 2023 marked the 18th consecutive year of meeting our financial guidance. And as indicated upfront, we achieved this without needing to adjust the bought deal equity issuance from our financial results. 2023 showcased the predictability of our business amid continued geopolitical instability, persistent inflation and rising interest rates. This is as a result of the 98% of Enbridge's earnings being generated from either cost-of- service or take-or-pay contract assets. Our debt portfolio is less than 10% exposed to floating rate volatility. Our customer base is over 95% investment grade, and 80% of our EBITDA is earned from assets with protection against inflation. We're rated BBB+ by all rating agencies and remain committed to our long-held leverage target of 4.5x to 5x. Our business risk is sector-leading amongst our midstream peers and the Gas Utilities acquisition will only enhance that. Now let's spend a few minutes on the key accomplishments of each of the business units, and we'll start with liquids. Liquids Pipeline really delivered record utilization once again in 2023. The mainline transported over 3.2 million barrels per day during the fourth quarter and averaged 3.1 million barrels per day for the full year. These numbers are a new all-time high and result from our team's continuous efforts to optimize our pipeline network. Growing production out of the Permian Basin and increased export demand continues to draw record crude oil volumes through our integrated Gray Oak pipeline and, of course, Ingleside export terminal. We also concluded an oversubscribed binding open season on Southern Lights, which will lock up 165,000 barrels per day of existing capacity that was coming up for renewal in 2025. We filed our mainline tolling settlement with the Canadian energy regulator in December and expect an expedited review process. Our customers will receive the competitive and responsive service they are accustomed to, Enbridge will earn attractive risk-adjusted returns and the mainline will continue to feed North American and global markets with a long-term source of safe, secure and affordable energy. When approved, the mainline will continue to earn an attractive risk-adjusted return on equity between 11% and 14.5%. The agreement also includes customer support for Line 5 capital expenditures, ensuring that this critical piece of infrastructure remains operational and Enbridge can continue to deliver reliable and affordable energy to Michigan, Ohio and Eastern Canada. The settlement was unanimously approved by the Representative Shipper Group, and we're grateful for the support from our customers. Downstream of the mainline, we successfully concluded the 110,000 barrel per day open season on Flanagan South Pipeline. This secures full path transportation from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast, ensuring the mainline remains well utilized. Earlier in 2023, we sanctioned the initial phase of the Enbridge Houston Oil Terminal. This greenfield project located at the terminus of the Seaway Pipeline, will provide shippers with 2.7 million barrels of premier storage that is accessible by the Houston refineries. In the Permian region, we're still planning to initiate an open season for the Gray Oak pipeline in the coming months that will offer full path export service from the Permian Basin all the way to our Ingleside docs. And on the low carbon front, we're progressing the feed engineering for a blue ammonia production facility at Ingleside. This potential investment highlights the value of existing and diversified infrastructure to the energy transition. 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

The proposed facility will source feed gas from our Texas Eastern gas pipeline and the associated emissions will be sequestered in a nearby carbon storage facility through our partnership with Oxy, all of which further underlines the value enhancement opportunities, our integrated liquids, natural gas and lower carbon platform offers customers and investors. Finally, we continue to advance the technical evaluation work for the planned carbon capture utilization and storage hub in the Wabamun area. So let's move on to gas transmission. Starting in Canada, we closed the acquisition of Aitken Creek gas storage, a 77 Bcf working capacity facility in British Columbia, which is uniquely positioned to support local demand and upcoming Canadian LNG exports. And in December, we sold our interest in Alliance and Aux Sable for proceeds of $3.1 billion, continuing our track record of servicing value for shareholders through ongoing capital recycling. This transaction reduces our commodity price exposure and proceeds helped to finance the upcoming utility acquisitions. We've also refined our engineering estimates for the 300 million cubic feet per day expansion of the T-South gas pipeline in British Columbia. The total project is estimated to cost $4 billion, up from $3.6 billion originally. The increased costs are based on recent Class 4 estimates, which includes extensive engineering analysis, community consultation and also includes lessons learned from recently completed projects in the region. Of course, before proceeding, we will ensure that the full investment and return is recoverable through our cost- of-service framework on the West Coast pipeline. In the U.S., we continue to extend our LNG service offering as we progress the Rio Bravo Pipeline and the Venus extension pipeline, which we expect to place into service later this year. We've concluded an open season on the Algonquin pipeline system for additional gas delivery to New England. And we're pleased with the results and are currently evaluating potential options to satisfy our customers' needs. In March, we acquired Tres Palacios, which adds 35 Bcf of working gas storage and enhances our customer service offering in the area. This facility is a key piece of infrastructure that serves local gas-fired power generation, LNG exports and pipeline capacity to Mexico. Finally, we announced the acquisition of several high- quality operating landfill waste RNG assets in Texas, in Arkansas from Morrow Renewables. These investments align with Enbridge's utility-like cash flow framework and are underpinned by long-term offtake contracts. The landfills we acquired are expected to double in size by 2040 with minimal capital investment, which will supplement our growth for years to come. The Morrow Renewables investment aligns well with our corporate strategy and supports our energy transition and growth expectations. Turning to gas distribution and storage. Enbridge Gas had a strong year. We added 46,000 new customers, which was ahead of expectations. We invested $1.2 billion, modernizing and expanding the distribution network during '23 to support the growing needs for reliable and affordable energy in the province. In December, the Ontario Energy Board issued its decision on our rebasing application for 2024. And overall, we're not pleased with the outcome. As it doesn't align with the provincial government's policy on the future of natural gas within Ontario nor the affordability and reliability of gas for our residential and industrial customers. While the decision itself isn't material to Enbridge's '24 guidance, we filed a notice of appeal with the divisional court and a notice of motion with the OEB regarding several aspects of this decision that we believe are inconsistent and amount to an error in law. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on delivering safe and reliable energy for our customers in Ontario. Now moving to the gas utility acquisitions in the U.S. We continue to be very excited about the transaction, including the fact that it was executed at a historically attractive valuation of 1.3x the forward rate base.

assets all operate in supportive and transparent jurisdictions and will add low-risk regulated earnings in quick cycle, rate base investment opportunities to our backlog. As you can see on the slide, we've prefunded approximately 85% of the aggregate purchase price since we announced the transaction in September last year, and all 3 are on track to close in 2024. So with that, let's jump into the renewables. Our scale and diversification and investing approach to renewables allows us to continue to find attractive opportunities even as returns compress for many across the sector. In Germany, we acquired additional interest in the Hohe See and Alberta's offshore wind farms. These are high-quality operating assets that we know well and the transaction is immediately accretive to our DCF. In France, we continue to approach the commercial operation dates for both Fécamp and Provence Grand Large in early 2024. And Calvados is scheduled to come into service in 2025. Enbridge was also awarded the right to develop a 1 gigawatt offshore wind farm in Normandy, which we expect could enter service around 2030. We'll be developing that wind farm with EDF, continuing a partnership of successful developments in the renewable space. And then last November, we extended the partnership onshore in North America where we jointly are constructing and operating the 577-megawatt Fox Squirrel Solar facility in Ohio. The initial phase of this project generates about 150 megawatts and was placed into service in December 2023. Our portfolio of late- stage onshore development projects continues to approach the construction-ready phase with expected 2025 in- service dates. And finally, we also placed 3 solar self-power projects into service during the year, adding some 30 megawatts of capacity and reducing our mainline emissions footprint. So now I'll pass it off to Pat to walk through our financial results. Patrick Murray Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to present a record quarter and full year financial results here at Enbridge. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we exceeded the midpoint of our 2023 EBITDA and DCF per share guidance, representing our 18th straight year of achieving or beating our outlook. Year-over-year, fourth quarter EBITDA was up over 5%, and DCF is up 3%. Our DCF per share is down 2%, including the dilution related to the derisking of the financing plan for the gas utility acquisition. These quarterly results cap off a fantastic year for Enbridge and are underpinned by a high utilization across all our systems. In liquids, our mainline transported a record 3.2 million barrels per day during the fourth quarter. Our Mid- Continent and Gulf Coast assets also delivered strong operational results with Ingleside and Gray Oak setting new quarterly volume records. These record volumes were partially offset by the lower mainline toll, which took place on July 1. Gas Transmission is down marginally over the quarter due to the timing of revenue recognition related to the Texas Eastern case in the fourth quarter of last year. EGI continues to benefit from higher distribution rates from EGI's incentive rate mechanism despite a mild winter negatively impacting fourth quarter results by about $30 million compared to normal conditions. Our renewable business improved during the quarter, primarily from the increased interest in our German offshore wind assets, which closed in early November. Energy Services results improved compared to the same quarter last year due to the expiry of transportation commitments, as we have noted in prior quarters and less pronounced backwardation in commodity markets. Realized foreign exchange had losses were lower in the fourth quarter as our hedge rate was right around the spot rate of $1.35. Below the line in DCF per share and as expected, higher interest expense, the effect of the bought deal I mentioned earlier and lower distributions in excess of earnings from our equity investments, partially offset by 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

higher EBITDA and operations this quarter. With that, let's quickly review the year ahead. I'm pleased to reaffirm Enbridge's 2024 EBITDA guidance range of $16.6 billion to $17.2 billion and DCF per share guidance of $5.40 to $5.80 per share. This represents 4% EBITDA growth versus the 2023 guidance midpoint. As a reminder, our 2024 guidance is set on the base business, excluding the EBITDA, CapEx and associated financing impact of the U.S. gas utilities expected to close throughout this year. The reason we chose to issue guidance excluding the acquisition, is that we want to showcase the strength of our base business and how it is performing relative to the growth outlook we shared at our Investor Day last March. There's some uncertainty around the timing of the close for the LDCs, but we do expect some level of contribution from all 3 utilities this year, and I'll discuss that on the next slide. There are a few key assumptions underpinning our 2024 guidance. Our 2024 mainline volume forecast is approximately 3 million barrels per day. This estimate was struck using TMX's public and service date estimate when we release guidance. For reference, apportionment on the mainline rose throughout the fourth quarter, and our December throughput averaged 3.26 million barrels per day. Today, we have more conviction than ever that the mainline will continue to be very well utilized for years to come. We also included the sale of our interest in Alliance and Aux Sable and the guidance we provided in November. As is practiced at Enbridge, we've minimized our foreign exchange and interest rate exposure for the upcoming year, the U.S. dollar-denominated DCF is almost entirely hedged at 135 and less than 10% of our total debt portfolio exposed to interest rates volatility in 2024. Now let's look briefly at the EBIT implications from the expected closing of the gas utilities. We continue to expect staggered closes of the utilities throughout the year. Each will provide incremental contributions above our base business guidance. Given that the time line for regulatory approvals are fluid, we limited the associated incremental contributions from our guidance. That being said, if the utilities close on schedule, our overall EBITDA could exceed the upper band of the guidance range while per share metrics in 2024 will be impacted by the full year of share dilution. Let's turn over to our secured growth outlook. Our secured growth program sits at $24 billion. New to the table this quarter is the addition of the Fox Squirrel Solar Phase 2 and the incremental capital for T cell Sunrise expansion as well as another year of utility growth and GTM modernization capital. In 2023, we added an additional $10 billion of new secured capital to our backlog, adding visibility and duration to our multiyear growth outlook, which I look forward to discussing more at Enbridge Day in March. We placed over $2 billion of organic capital into service, primarily from our utility growth program in Ontario and our GTM modernization program. With that, let's revisit Enbridge's capital allocation priorities before I turn the presentation back to Greg to wrap things up. Our approach to capital allocation is focused on maximizing shareholders' return. We're excited by all the opportunities ahead of us, but we're going to grow in a disciplined manner while sticking to our leverage and payout targets. Enbridge is fully committed to our leverage guardrails of 4.5 to 5x debt to EBITDA, and we'll continue to operate within this range post the utility acquisitions. With the announced sale of Alliance and Aux Sable in 2023, we continue our track record of successfully high-grading our capital and we'll continue to look for opportunities to recycle assets at attractive multiples. In November, we announced a 3.1% increase to the; Enbridge dividend, our 29th consecutive annual increase. Our long-held dividend payout policy is 60% to 70% of DCF and we'll continue to grow the dividend up to our medium- term DCF per share growth. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Greg. 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Gregory Ebel Well, thanks very much, Pat. As I reflect on my first year leading the team here at Enbridge, who are tasked with delivering on behalf of our investors. I'm pretty pleased with how 2023 came in and extremely excited about 2024 and beyond. The financial results from the businesses reached record levels, and the same was true of the operational results right across our business units. Whether it was continuing to execute on our organic growth projects, picking up tuck-in assets across our liquids, gas pipeline and renewable systems or reaching value- enhancing regulatory outcomes like the mainline toll settlement that serve our customers and investors. The team really delivered in 2023 and set up the company for continued long-term growth. We also continue to deliver record operational and safety results, which further underlines Enbridge's reputation as the first-choice provider of energy logistics for all of our stakeholders. And equally important, we further diversified and extended our geographic reach and opportunity set in the natural gas utility business with a significant acquisition of 3 great gas utilities in growth regions of the U.S., which will extend our growth aspirations through the decade. So a great job by the team on behalf of our investors and customers. I'm less pleased, of course, with the stock performance in 2023, yet very excited about its future. With growing earnings and dividends underpinned by not 1, not 2, but 3 of the top position businesses of their kind in North America, liquids pipelines, gas transmission and gas distribution and a fourth business renewables, very prudently becoming a top player, we expect to deliver excellent returns for our investors. As a balanced view of energy transition and the key elements of that become increasingly clear to investors and policymakers alike, Enbridge's diversified and balanced portfolio looks increasingly like the first choice for investors. And while I'm not predicting interest rates, the inevitable easing of monetary policy will bring dividend yields on utility-like stocks such as Enbridge back into a more typical range relative to government bonds. With our prudent capital allocation actions, strong commitment to the balance sheet, low risk and growing earnings and dividends, we will deliver long-term value for investors and serve our various stakeholders along the way with excellence. Pat and I, along with our 4 business unit leaders, look forward to discussing our continued growth opportunities and this investment thesis at our upcoming Investor Day in New York on March 6. Hope to see you there. And now let's open the lines for your questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier Congratulations on the results. This question is probably better suited for Michele. I was wondering if you could characterize the progress you're making towards regulatory approval for the U.S. utilities. And specifically, can you comment on where you're trying to demonstrate a net benefit? Can you provide your view on rate case stay- out periods compared to other benefits that you might have as options to offer rate pairs? Michele Harradence 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 7/19

Sure. So let me start just with the regulatory approval. We have 2 out of the 3 federal regulatory approvals in the hands of CFIUS and HSR. We're waiting on FCC for a couple of the utilities we received North Carolina, I think earlier this week, and we expect rest of those by mid-month. And then things are progressing really well with the 3 utilities from a state-level perspective. We expect -- we still expect Ohio to go first then Utah, then North Carolina and all of that through the course of this year. As you pointed out, with a couple of the utilities, we do want to be able to demonstrate a net benefit. We think overall for all of the utilities, we can demonstrate a net benefit. And a lot of that is going to be off of leveraging the fact that this creates the largest natural gas platform, 7 million customers, that ability to bring together the strengths of the different utilities rather. So if you think, as an example, Ohio is very technically strong. Utah, a very good cost to serve, very commercially strong in North Carolina. And of course, the benefit of 175 years of multiple areas of growth in Ontario and just already having 4 million customers really allows us to scale up. So we're looking at all of those things and demonstrating all those things to the utilities. In terms of the stay-outs, we will consider those if it's appropriate. It's part of any discussion. I mean we expect to have some requests for stay out. I think we had one of the intervenors in Utah last week, request to stay out earlier this week. And that will be something that we'll see -- we're quite confident we can come to beneficial terms with everybody. And like I said, by bringing these 4 utilities together in the strengths they each have, there's no question that we'll be able to demonstrate net benefits. Robert Catellier Okay. And just a second question here with respect to the regulatory process around rerouting Line 5 around the Bad River lands, Understanding that you've appealed the 2023 decisions. I wondered if you can give an update on the time line that was contemplated in the previous judgment specifically, where the regulatory process to vis-a- vis that time line? And do you expect any protection from the 1977 pipeline Tree? Gregory Ebel Yes, for sure, Robert. Thanks for the questions. And Colin is on the line, so he's probably the best one to update on that. Colin Gruending Robert, yes, sure. So the appeals hearing has started, both Enbridge and the Bad River Band appealed that decision. And that hearing has begun. We expect a decision on that later this year. In the meantime, we continue to try to work cooperatively with the band to come to an amicable settlement. The original decision, if that survives would have us reroute -- the 41-mile reroute around the community by June 2026. That is doable. We are ready to go the critical path, permit is a Wisconsin DNR permit, which we expect here in the next month or two, which would allow us over a year or two to build that, which is doable. So that's the plan. And your second question was with regard to the treaty, yes. And we think that that holds obviously, that's the reason the treaties were created and we expect that to endure. Gregory Ebel 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 8/19

Page 9
Robert, I'd just add on the treaty. I think that the, one thing I'd say is I give a lot of credit to the Canadian government, provincial governments, been very strong supporters on this. So just understanding the -- just really criticality of Line 5 to so many different areas, labor unions, et cetera. So we feel good about that. We'll have to see and I know there's been a request for the U.S. government to have a viewpoint on this. We'll see whether or not that happens. But just really strong support on both sides of the border and making sure we get through this in the right way so that all those consumers can be served. So you never know with core things, but we feel very good about the level of support that we've got. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Theresa Chen I'd like to touch on the liquid side as well. In terms of your mainline outlook for 2024, given the apportionment many consecutive months, the delays in TMX and likely tracking above where we all originally thought we would be at this point and heading into summer 2024. What is your outlook for the system for the remainder of the year? And what kind of upside can it bring relative to the 3 million barrel per day throughput assumption embedded in guidance? And how does that translate to the upper end of the guidance or above? Colin Gruending Yes. Theresa, I can take that. It's Colin. Yes. So Listen, we're very confident in the mainline full path to the U.S. Gulf Coast. We think it will be substantially full the foreseeable future. I think we've used numbers like 95% to 100% even in '24 through the piece. And I guess to your point, I mean, the main line has been basically full for 75 years. So it's a trend that continues, and there's a bunch of fundamental reasons for that. So as Pat said, we're confident in our '24 guidance of 3 million barrels per day on average. That assumes the April 1 TMX and service date. But to the extent it is delayed, that's a slight tailwind. Again, we believe we're going to be substantially full anyway. So a slight delay doesn't provide a massive increase for us, but there is some upside to that. I'm sure we'll get into this more at Enbridge Day. But there's, like, to your point, there's a lot of demand pull on the mainline path, 39 refineries directly and directly connected traditional markets, they pull that way. We've got a very competitive toll. We've contracted as much as we can on Flanagan South. That was very successful, that should be a strong market endorsement for that pull as well. I won't make any comments on TMX's time line or capabilities, but very confident in the mainline path. And of course, we're building EHOT, I forgot about that, in Houston to further strengthen that. So yes, confident in 3.0 that's relative to 3.1 delivered just this year. And we've seen, to your point, massively overscribed nominations in the last number of months including January and February. So the trend continues. Theresa Chen Got it. And then in terms of the Dominion asset acquisitions, as we consider the remaining funding, just to clarify, the list of funding options that you put out there, is that consistent with your preference as far as prioritization i.e., aside from additional asset sales, you would rather do DRIP ATM over additional hybrids and bonds? 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 9/19

Page 10
Gregory Ebel No, I wouldn't look at it like that, Theresa, it's Greg. I think we just -- I wouldn't read anything into the listing there. I think we just wanted to make the point that look, we've got all options available to us. And we may not use all those options. So yes, we've got the debt markets unsecured notes and hybrids. And I guess if I had to go down any list, I would say DRIP is probably the least interest from that perspective. But frankly, everything is on the table from that perspective. And as you know, we've done a good job on recycling, too. So no, it's going to be situational. As you know, we brought in much of the financing. So if somebody came along tomorrow and said you can close this utility or that one, we're ready to go. So I think that creates a ton of flexibility, which is why we went out early. Pat, I don't know if you want to add to that. Patrick Murray I think you add it with us -- I think you hit it with us securing well over 85% of that funding. We're in really good shape to be selective of what we do and make sure we're making the best decision for our shareholders as we move forward. Operator Next question comes from the line of Robert Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan If I can just continue on the funding side for the Dominion utilities acquisitions. So you've got that roughly $3 billion left to go. You've been out in front of the hybrids and the Alliance, Aux Sable transaction. I guess I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about the timing of addressing the rest of the need vis-a-vis the closing? And as you mentioned around asset monetizations. Can you just give a sense as to -- obviously, you don't want to get necessarily into assets, but how much is in flight in terms of processes right now relative to that $3 billion? Gregory Ebel Well, I'd say we're always looking at asset recycling. So I wouldn't even necessarily tie it to the transaction. I mean, I'm trying to think about if there's been a year in the last 4 or 5, where we haven't recycled. So we're always looking at assets. So I wouldn't necessarily, the dollars are back-and-forth fungible. From a timing perspective, I would again go down in many respects, depending on which ones happen. The first 2 are basically financed. So we're going to have to look at what is the timing of those actual approvals, and that's going to determine which instrument we actually use. Obviously, some are quicker to exercise than others. So not meaning to be evasive rather, but I wouldn't necessarily tie recycling to just this transaction. I think we look at it. Look, if somebody else has got greater value on an asset than we put on it then you pull that trigger, right? And if it doesn't seem to have the growth or they can do something different with it. And I think Alliance and Aux Sable is exactly that. It had commodity exposure, but relatively low growth and it fit the buyer's desire to kind of be more in that business and probably they could take more risk and that they're more willing to do given our utility-like structure. So I wouldn't tie any one of these 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 10/19

Page 11
instruments just to the transaction, I tie it more to -- we'll know more as each one of these close, which ones we'll pull at that point in time. Robert Kwan Understood. I guess that answered as a segue into the second question and on the other side, just if we're thinking about capital allocation in 2024, following the announcement of the Utah acquisition, you also acquired some other businesses, the German wind incremental sale or a state, Morrow, Fox Squirrel. Yes. Generically, are other acquisitions budgeted into guidance here, and I get that I'm trying to color code this to a degree, but anything else you do does kind of leave the dominion thing outstanding. So how are you thinking about acquisitions in 2024, given you're still short? Gregory Ebel Right. So first of all, there are no other acquisitions in our budget, right, or in our forecast that we've put out or in our budget for that matters the same. So that's one. Two, if anything came along, as you can imagine, as a big player in the sector and throughout North America, we get to see things all the time. It would have to be tuck-in like first of all, so nowhere near like what we did last year. Secondly, we have to be immediately accretive to our share -- per share metrics. And thirdly, it would have to be neutral or accretive to our debt metrics as well. And when I think about different parts of the business, and I'm sure Colin will speak to this on Investor Day, we've got some great builds that can be done at low medium single digit. So there's -- the competition for capital will be challenging given the position our base businesses are in today and the growth opportunities that they see, but we'll have to look at it. So again, no M&A is in our forecast other than the ones that we're closing today. It's a high hurdle rate on the M&A front, and we're very focused on integrating these new assets with excellent right across the board, whether it's the renewable stuff that Matthew manages or whether it's the Morrow assets. And remember, we bought a couple of storage assets, making sure that's all running exactly as we wanted to do is going to be a key focus. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Linda Ezergailis from TD Cowen. Linda Ezergailis This is a bit of a foundational question on just the regulatory compact in North America, or specifically the U.S. and it relates to the Chevron doctrine, it's been about 40 years since the Supreme Court decided that the court should defer to an agency's -- a federal agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute. If that gets discarded or removed this summer, what impact might that have on your business? And how might that inform your approach to, for example, a likely higher frequency of settlements in your gas transmission business, how you might see federal agencies maybe shifting their approach, and I think there could be a few moving parts there. If you could just comment on how you're thinking of that evolving situation. Gregory Ebel 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 11/19

Page 12
Yes, it's a good question. It's -- we'll probably have to give that some more consideration at Investor Day and walk through that a little bit. I mean, obviously, there are several pieces of this. It depends on which part of the business, as you point out, it's probably a much more relevant issue to our utility businesses that are coming in, particularly in the United States because many of our other businesses, as you know, we're often seeking to settle, whether it's Texas Eastern, whether it's the mainline tolling settlement. We like to work with customers and get more of a deal in that regard. But as it is with the utilities, I'll even go as far as things like incentive -- long-term incentive deals like we've been able to do historically in Ontario. I think that limits some of our exposure to some of the -- if there's a change in the Chevron doctrine, but -- and I think it's a good point, Linda, and we should probably give it a more fulsome discussion and answer as we kind of move into Investor Day. I don't know, Michele, do you want to add anything to that or? Michele Harradence Well, I think at the end of the day, a lot of what we deal with at the utilities is determined and is inside the jurisdiction at the state level. So in that sense, we'll be looking to them, but I think we'd better take that one back. Linda Ezergailis Yes, I look forward to that because, yes, even renewable policy and stuff like that could be a focus. But just maybe as a follow-on, just with respect to your appeal in motion in Ontario. Can you give us an update on how you're partnering with the provincial government because they were -- I think they had an intention to introduce legislation to overturn a certain aspect of the OEB decision as it related to eliminating amortization of new gas connections for homes and affordability. And then maybe you can just comment on the time line of these processes and when you expect them to be resolved. And if you're fully successful, kind of what the upside is versus kind of the current decision as it stands? Michele Harradence Sure. I can cover a few of those things. So I wouldn't say we're partnering with the government of Ontario, but we certainly made our concerns clear to them, although as you saw by the pretty swift and decisive statements they made within hours of the release, they were well ahead of us on the concerns. I mean, at the end of the day, obviously, we're disappointed, but this is a case where the regulators made a decision that's just simply not in keeping with the policies of the government. That's exactly what Minister Smith said right away. We don't expect it to be material to Enbridge's overall 2024 financial guidance, but it's frustrating and disappointing on a lot of fronts. I mean there's a strong bias against natural gas in there. There's a presuppose that we'll rapidly electrify all the heating load and abandon the gas network. And fundamentally, it limits access to affordable energy. I mean the fact of the matter is I think there's short-term issues and there may be some short-term struggles here. But long term, the fact of the matter is Ontario is not going to meet its economic growth aspirations without the flexibility and affordability of the natural gas and natural gas infrastructure provides it. The government knows that. I mean they've said very clearly they need to build 1.5 million new homes in the next 10 years. There's almost 3 million people expected to move to Ontario in the next decade. And I don't know that folks fully recognize this, but our -- for example, our industrial and contract market growth has been really strong in the last few years, and that's coming from things like the electrical -- the electric vehicle battery, the manufacturing sector. I was just 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 12/19

Page 13
down looking at the Nexstar plant. They need our cost-effective natural gas to support their manufacturing processes. The greenhouse developers that we have in Southwestern Ontario absolutely rely on natural gas to provide their product affordably. And things like steelmaking, whether that's Athabasca and Hamilton or others need natural gas to reduce the carbon intensity of what they have. So -- we're certainly working with the government of Ontario, making sure they understand the full implications of this decision that it goes well beyond the revenue horizon piece. I mean, to state the obvious, that impacts our ability to deliver those homes, but that's further reaching than that, over the long term, should it stay in place. I mean, in the near term, it's about $300 million in capital that it pulls back this year for us. But again, it remains to be seen what actions are taken. We, of course, have preserved our interest by filing a notice to appeal and a motion with the Ontario divisional courts and motion to review. The motion review would likely go first. That's what the Ontario Energy Board itself or we would set out a number of things, including the fact that there are new facts on the table, the new facts pointing to the press release from the government that clarifies its policy, the energy and electrification transition panel that sort of thing will be out there. Typically, the time line for something like a review motion of this. Can it be anywhere from 135 to 165 days. And we'll go through those steps certainly? But as you said, the government has said that they will take action and take that action much more immediately. The legislature is coming back, I think it's February 20. And they certainly do understand that the immediacy of the issue that this impacts us right here and right now should we reduce those levels of capital and that it's important to them to maintain Ontario is an attractive place to invest. So I'm pretty confident we're going to get this one resolved. It's always good to be on the side of where government wants to go and on the side of their policy. And in the meantime, like we talked about earlier, we've got lots of focus on to with finalizing the acquisitions of the 3 utilities in the U.S. and integrating them. Gregory Ebel Yes, Linda, I think that real milestone, as Michele said is, let's see what happens at the end of February. That's a triggering event for us as to where things look like they're going. As you said, it doesn't really have an impact on '24. The issue is from a long-term perspective, if they get this right and they want to see continued economic growth and reach their sustainability goals, that means there's going to be a greater rate base in the natural gas business, and that's what it's all about. And it's kind of up that obviously, we saw this coming, but it's kind of [indiscernible] for us that that there are 3 other jurisdictions that would love to have our investment opportunities and actually are very positively disposed and have legislation even giving the choice that we want Ontario consumers to have. So I think from an Enbridge perspective, the net opportunity is still more rate base, more earnings opportunity and more growth. Hopefully, in 4 jurisdictions in North America and that's kind of what we're focused on achieving. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Just want to follow up, I guess, on the last point as it relates to Enbridge Gas there. And wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit more about the time line, how things could unfold here in as you think about OEB Phase II, Phase III, just thoughts at this point given what's transpired so far? And at the same time, what you're touching on there as far as, I guess, when the Dominion acquisition concludes successfully, could you see kind of capital being pulled away towards those jurisdictions, given kind of what you've seen for regulatory outcomes so far. Michele Harradence Thank you. Yes. Like I said earlier, I mean, the real -- and as Greg said, that really indicative point will be later this month when we see what the government of Ontario comes out with in terms of how they propose to rectify this issue and follow through on Minister Smith's statements. That being said, there is the motion to review process that I mentioned that will take a few months. I mean that would likely take till by summer for us to resolve things. But -- that being said, there's plenty of work for us to do in Ontario, and we're continuing to certainly always focus on investing and ensuring the safety and the reliability of the assets we have and that they continue to flow and provide the gas that people need and want were big fans a set of customer choice. And that's really where, as Greg alluded to, that goes to the U.S. jurisdictions and the 3 utilities that we've acquired there. I mean they all have very strong equity thickness. They all have good ROEs and we'll be looking to make sure that we understand exactly what the growth opportunities are. I mean, we've looked at it through our due diligence, of course, and we feel very good about the growth opportunities. I mean, Ohio has strong modernization program with very quick return on its capital. We see in Utah very strong customer growth. They're also using a natural gas for some decarbonization activities. There's a lot of commercial growth there. And then similarly, in North Carolina, very strong commercial and residential growth. And again, the determinization where they're looking to move -- or reduce their intensity of their power production moving off of coal and into natural gas. We've seen really good growth in our regulated business in Ontario. I think I've mentioned why I really believe we'll continue to see really good growth in Ontario. Strong people are moving to Ontario, lots of homes wanting to be built. It's got all the pieces. I mean, we're towards the end of our modernization program in Ontario, but we still have lots of work to do to help industrials to reduce their intensity. But the fact is we currently have an equity thickness for the gas utility there that although it went up marginally a couple of percentage points with the decision of the OEB, it's still one of the lowest in North America. And as LDCs, we need to compete for capital. That's -- whether that's here within Enbridge or on a North American scale. So these jurisdictions that are new to us, these new to us utilities, they operate in strong jurisdictions that recognize that part of ensuring the sustainability of their energy systems and their economies includes ensuring they have a transparent, predictable and competitive regulatory regime. So we're really, really excited about bringing them in as quickly as possible, integrating them smoothly and looking towards where else there's growth. Jeremy Tonet Got it. Makes sense. And just second question real quick here. I suppose you're not going to give us everything that's going to be happening at the Analyst Day, but just wondering if there's any foreshadowing or overall objectives that you see for the upcoming Analyst Day that you want the investment community to come away with. 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Gregory Ebel Yes. Well, you're right. We're not going to give you an insight here that would not make March 6 that much fun actually. But look, the fundamental fact is, and I don't believe that currently the stock reflects that it in any way should perform is that we've got a growth plan that extends beyond the 3-year forecast that we put out and our expectations. I don't think that's being realized in the market, both from an efficiency perspective, in terms of the blending and extending of growth with the new assets that we picked up and that we're building. And we're really going to walk through that for all of you and how all of these pieces fit together. And I'll just -- I'll give a brief example. Rebecca is looking at me, say, don't give too much. But just a brief example would be think about Ohio itself, you're just talking about the utilities. We have all of our businesses located in Ohio. It's a good example where we see opportunities to provide customers, shareholders and stakeholders with real value added. So we have liquids lines that serve refineries there. We have gas transmission that goes through Ohio. We'll have a great utility there that wants to see growth and Matthews get renewable assets there. So we think that is a real opportunity to create value on all fronts, and I don't think that's being realized. So that's the thesis, and that's what I want you to walk away from March 6 with. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Robert Hope A bit of a broader question from me, in your conversations, you've talked about some good regulatory jurisdictions versus a more challenging decision from Ontario. Historically, Ontario has been seen as a relatively pro-gas and relatively good regulatory regime. So when you look forward, especially given the fact that you will be introducing some incremental jurisdictions here. How do you ensure that the good regulatory jurisdictions stay that way? And then as you move forward, how do you expect to continue to interact with the government and regulators such that they see the value and need of the natural gas systems? Michele Harradence Sure, I can take that. Well, first of all, let's be clear, Ontario still is pro-gas. I mean that's -- I think if you take nothing from the statement from the Minister of Energy, take that, I'd also refer you to things like the powering Ontario's growth plan that they have. So -- but at the end of the day, I think with all of these jurisdictions, one of the things we really believe is that strong local presence is important. So we will -- we have maintained very strong local leaders of each of these utilities. So the Vice Presidents and GMs for Ohio, Utah and North Carolina, they're there. They're very well known by the regulators, well known by the folks in government in each of those jurisdictions. Just like our folks in Ontario are very well known and well respected. I mean it's really important to us to be seen as trusted advisers to be transparent in our dealings to do what's best for the communities we operate in. I mean we think of ourselves as being in service. And in fact, that service name is in some of the utilities name. So those are all critical. But in order to ensure that we make the transition smoothly, it's been very important for us to go out and meet with the regulators. I personally met with the head of every public utility that we are -- that has jurisdiction of the assets we're acquiring, whether that's Wyoming, Utah, North Carolina, Ohio, I've met with their staff. I met with various members of government. 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 15/19

Page 16
Greg, I think you've met with at least 2 of the governors. You met with Ohio and you and I met together with Utah. I think I'm meeting with North Carolina here in a couple of weeks, the government of North Carolina. I met with the returning Governor of North Carolina a couple of weeks ago. I mean, that's an important part of it that they understand who we are, that we're credible that we'll do the right thing by these jurisdictions. And I can tell you, all 4 of them, what they talked to me about is wanting to ensure that gas continues to be delivered reliably and affordably. And that's something that is a real advantage that all of these utilities have. I mean if you look at the storage, we haven't talked about our carbon storage facility because maybe we haven't had the extreme cold that we've had in the past. But Dawn has continued to just set records out of Ontario. Ohio has what is the sixth major pipelines that are serving it. Utah with the Wexpro asset, again, that really -- all of those things really help keep the price stable, keep it affordable, keep it reliable. Same thing in North Carolina. We've got an LNG facility there and we will have an LNG facility there. I can't get ahead of myself and we, of course, the folks in North Carolina are proposing a second one. So that's really what they care about. It's important to keep those relationships open. It's important that they know that they can reach out to us at any time, and it's important for us to be listening closely to what they want for their people. Gregory Ebel Robert, I think you've taken it up to the overall Enbridge level, I think whether it's Cynthia's business, Colin's business, you've heard both Michele or Matthews, I think we work real hard at our regulatory relationships we have to, much harder than we did historically because of some of the, what I'll say, confusion about energy transition. And I think the whole portfolio, when you look at it from top to bottom, really fits the current state and actually probably the state that it will be in some period of time, long, long tail and future for oil, natural gas, it's not a destination fuel. It's an ultimate field that's going to be -- there isn't really a future without natural gas in most parts of the planet. And that doesn't take away from renewables. And we get into those communities. We're in 40-plus states and 8 provinces. And we've got to make sure that they value our investment. I think if you look at our indigenous reconciliation action plan is another good example. And you look at projects we've done to include groups that haven't historically been involved. That's how you build strong alliances and those strong alliances actually make the regulator's job easier. And when you get something off balance that seems to be counter to a regulatory outcome that's counter to policy or the communities, then you see those changes. And that's what you had in Ontario, right? So the regulators required to independently regulate consistent with government policy. That's not what happened in Ontario, right? But it's our job to keep working with these communities. And when you have issues, make sure that the homebuilders understand the implications. Make sure that the manufacturers understand the implications that our union brothers and sisters understand the implications. So I think it's much bigger than regulatory. And as an industry and definitely as a company, I think we've continued to improve with that. And we've got to keep getting better and better at that and selling our message. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO. Benjamin Pham Maybe I can go back to the mainline. I know you've been talking about the positive trends in terms of volumes this year. And -- and I'm wondering if you can maybe add a bit of color on -- do you think some of this is 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

producers building ahead of TMX? Or you think it's more mostly demand-driven that's driving it? Colin Gruending Ben, it's Colin. Yes, thanks for your question. And I've kind of looked through most of the analyst estimates, and I think most analysts have updated their forecast on this. And I think this notion that the main line is going to lose a bunch of volume and TMX comes in. It's a bit of a stale concept. It might have been valid a few years ago, but it's been delayed materially. And in that multiyear period of delay, supply has structurally and permanently grown. It's ratable production. And that demand is there. It's basically insatiable. So I mean just to run through this, in 2022, supply grew by 100,000 barrels a day. Last year, in '23, supply grew by 150,000 and barrels per day in Canada. In 2024, it's looking to grow between 250,000 and 300,000 a day, and in '25, another couple of hundred thousand barrels per day. If you add that up, it's probably 2x what TMX is likely to practically move. So that's kind of the math that we're looking at and gives us a lot of confidence in the 3 million barrels per day forecast for 2024, there has been a bit of storage growth to your -- maybe to your point, anticipation of that, and we see that in our nominations and oversubscribed. So apportionment has been high. It may -- we may still have apportionment once TMX comes in, depending on the month or day or a crude slate. So we're going to be pretty full. I don't know if that answers your question. Benjamin Pham Yes. That's great. It's interesting term events. And maybe the second question, maybe for Greg. When you talk about balanced business mix with Dominion, are you putting renewables and gas when you think about that percentage and how you frame the business mix, are you -- do you think about that as a separate part in your business mix? Gregory Ebel It's interesting because we definitely -- we put the 4 businesses, if you drew a pie chart, if you will. We put them separately. But I guess what I was saying is that they're just increasingly more integrated in terms of what our customers and I think what investors want as well even on a proportion basis. So here's the way I would look at it. Just about 50% or once the utilities are closed, maybe a little bit less than 50% of the business will be liquids and 50% or more will be gas and renewables. So that's probably the way to think about it from a split perspective. There's no doubt, as you know, a lot of support for renewables is needed by the gas sector, right? So it's back up. So they're definitely connected. And often, that's done by utilities, but sometimes it's done by independent other power plants or just the gas pipelines as well, making sure that flows. So I think we kind of -- you're right, we sort of split the liquids business and then the gas business and renewable business together. But they really are working all together on multiple fronts. And again, I think we're going to talk about that at our Investor Day. Operator Our final question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 17/19

Page 18
Praneeth Satish Maybe on that last point of being split, 50% gas, renewables, LDC and 50% liquids. I'm just thinking maybe strategically, how you think about the company pro forma for the LDC transactions? Is it more of a utility or a midstream company? And then I guess in the context of that, do you think there should be more focus by investors on PE multiples and earnings rather than EBITDA and free cash flow and then maybe even more leveraged credit from the rating agencies? Just kind of curious for your thoughts on that. Gregory Ebel Yes, it's a bit of a -- I mean, I guess I would say the entire company, we've moved to be more utility-like, right, even if you think about the MTS, Colin's again that filled off that and both to get approved or even as you think about the renewable business, we've structured our renewable business very different from some of the folks that you see out there, i.e. long-term power purchase or contracts for projects even before they're built or immediately upon construction. So I think that's very utility-like. I think DCF is still the right look because you look at businesses like the liquids business that are generating a lot of cash flow, and they don't look as utility-like. So I think that's the right way to consider it. And then obviously, I think dividend yield. Dividend yield relative to long bonds and 10-year bonds of government. I think that's the other way people should. So I think it's a bit of a mix. And you're right, we have a little bit higher leverage for all the right reasons, no more risk than what you'd see at pure midstream, but considerably less than what you'd see major utilities in the United States. Praneeth Satish Got it. And then maybe just switching gears on to Gray Oak. It looks like you're close to launching an open season for the expansion in the coming months. Can you talk about if that goes well and your successful when that capacity could come into service? And then whether you'd be offering a joint tariff for transport and exports out of Ingleside and if so, do you think that concept of bundling the transport and export will give you a competitive advantage? Because as we look at the basin itself, it is kind of overbuilt from a takeaway or egress perspective. Gregory Ebel Yes, good question. I think Colin can take that. We've just had the Board down at Ingleside in the last few days for our Board meeting. There's a lot of excitement there. So Colin, do you want to take that? Colin Gruending Yes, sure. I wish I was still there, it's snowy up in Calgary here. So the answer is yes and yes. So you should -- the market should imminently expect basically at Gray Oak and Ingleside open season here in the next few weeks. I hope we talk more about that at Enbridge Day. It's, as Greg alluded to, very efficient capital deployment here, low, low, low multiples. Yes, on integrated tariffs. We already have the cheapest path to the water there. It's already a competitive advantage, but we can do more of that. And pipeline capacity to Corpus is effectively full already, probably some space to Houston, but a very attractive path to Corpus. So we want to bring some of that capacity on, call it, 100,000 to 200,000 barrels a day as soon as we can. There's appetite for that. It is relatively efficient, 3/1/25, 12:00 PM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1867886789&ts=3018540&ref=l6cin7 18/19

simple, plumbing increase here. So we can bring some of that on some in '24, and some in '25. And as a reminder, we've got a couple of million barrels of new tankage coming into service here in April, independent of that that we sanctioned last year. So -- the crawl, walk, run approach continues towards our large ambition in the permian to create a light super system to rival the heavy super system we have. Thanks for the question.

As you know, the acquisition of East Ohio Gas closed on March 6, which further diversifies our business, extends our growth outlook and enhances the stable cash flow profile of our asset base. As a reminder, we've already secured over 85% of the required financing for the U.S. gas utility acquisitions and will fund the remainder using a combination of alternatives, which may include hybrid or bond issuances, capital recycling and ATM issuances. We have the capacity to utilize any and all of these sources of funding and so that we can be in a position to optimize market conditions. You'll see us updating and preparing security filings to preserve this funding flexibility and ensure we complete all the utility acquisition funding well in advance of year end. We closed the Alliance-Aux Sable divestiture in April, continuing our track record of recycling capital at attractive multiples. The Mainline Tolling Agreement was recently approved as filed by the Canadian Energy Regulator. The Mainline continues to operate at or near capacity, and we are ready to add additional egress as our customers need it. We had exciting growth announcements in the U.S. Gulf Coast with our recent Whistler JV, the sanctioning of Sparta Pipeline and the acquisition of 2 marine docks and adjacent land at our Ingleside export facility. We've also recently progressed to full FID on the Tennessee Ridgeline Expansion project, following the TVA's decision to construct a new natural gas combined-cycle plant in Kingston, Tennessee. This project further underlines the criticality of pipelines in fueling lower-carbon power via gas generation. Today, we published our 23rd annual sustainability report, which highlights our performance and approach to environmental, social and governance goals. Now, before I touch on these developments further, let me take a moment to highlight what really was a first-rate financial performance in the quarter. Pat will be getting into this in more detail later, but we're going to be presenting side-by-side results, those being adjusted actuals and the base business we guided against. We believe this transparency will let you see our base business against our '24 guidance as well as the all-in results, which include a partial month of owning East Ohio Gas and all our utility financings to date. Starting with all in, our EBITDA is up 11% and DCF per share up 4% from last year, primarily due to strong asset performance across Liquids, Gas Transmission and Renewables as well as a partial month contribution from EOG. Our balance sheet remains well positioned ahead of the closings of Questar and PSNC at 4.7x debt to EBITDA. Since this number is as of March 31, these leverage numbers don't yet include the beneficial proceeds from the sale of Alliance and Aux Sable. Touching briefly on the base business, we are very much on track with our financial guidance. In fact, our base business EBITDA and DCF per share are up 8% and debt-to-EBITDA is at 4.6x. Under both views, we've had a record financial quarter and we look forward to keeping that momentum going. Our industry-leading business risk supports our long-held leverage target of 4.5 to 5x. Enbridge has virtually no commodity price exposure and over 98% of our earnings are generated from either cost of service or take-or-pay contracted assets and 80% of our EBITDA is earned from assets with protection against inflation. And we are well hedged against interest rate volatility with less than 5% of our debt portfolio exposed to floating rates. Now let's take a look at the notable highlights I mentioned earlier from each of our businesses, starting with Liquids. Liquids Pipelines delivered high utilization levels once again. The Mainline transported over 3.1 million barrels per day during the first quarter, and we continue to expect average throughput of 3 million barrels per day for the year. As I mentioned earlier, the Canadian Energy Regulator approved the Mainline Tolling Settlement, which we view as a win-win-win for Enbridge, our customers and the industry. Switching gears to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we acquired 2 strategic docks and nearby land adjacent to Ingleside for USD 200 million. This acquisition will optimize existing operations in the area by increasing VLCC docking 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

windows at Ingleside and will help set the stage for Ingleside to realize its ultimate potential as the industry- leading multiproduct export terminal in North America. In the Permian, we've launched our open season to expand Gray Oak capacity by up to 120,000 barrels per day, pending a successful open season. Recently, we finished constructing 4 new storage tanks at Ingleside, bringing total storage capacity to 18 million barrels there. And we've already sanctioned an additional 5 tanks to add another 2.5 million barrels of storage capacity by 2025. Now let's take a deeper look at Gas Transmission. In Canada, Woodfibre is progressing well, and we expect to reach the 60% engineering milestone in the second half of 2024. In the United States, we announced the formation of the Enbridge-Whitewater-MPLX joint venture. This transaction will be immediately accretive to DCF per share and our balance sheet metrics and allows us to establish a natural gas footprint in the Permian Basin. The Tennessee Ridgeline Expansion project has progressed to full FID. This is the natural gas pipeline, we announced a few years back that will deliver gas to the Tennessee Valley Authority's new natural gas combined- cycle plant, an emission-friendly replacement of their existing coal-fired power plant. Construction will begin in 2025 with an expected in-service date of Q4 2026. We also sanctioned the construction of offshore pipelines to service Shell and Equinor's U.S. Gulf Coast operations. Now before I discuss our strategic joint venture in more detail, let me take a moment to comment on the topic to [indiscernible]. In addition to the growing demand for natural gas to feed LNG terminals, the build-out of data centers and generative AI is forecasted to require a material increase in power generation. This new power generation will be fed by a combination of natural gas and renewables and supports our view that the world needs all forms of energy. As the sector evolves, Enbridge is well positioned to serve this increased demand through the vast footprint of our assets connected to key supply basins. And with Enbridge's asset base, we can offer customers access to permanent power by fueling natural gas generation and renewable power. It's a competitive advantage that we have to offer jurisdictions throughout North America. We expect this trend of serving data centers will take some time to ramp up but are ready to serve our customers and their energy needs through our integrated infrastructure network. Now let's take a deeper dive into our Whitewater joint venture. On March 26, we announced the formation of the Whistler Pipeline JV, which will -- only gas pipeline and storage network connecting the Permian Basin to the growing U.S. Gulf Coast demand. This transaction further extends our access to the U.S. Gulf Coast LNG terminals, adding a connection to Cheniere's Corpus Christi terminal. There are 4 assets within the JV, the Whistler Pipeline and the Waha natural gas storage which are currently in operation, the ADCC pipeline, which is expected to come into service in Q3 and the Rio Bravo pipeline, which will enter service in 2026. The portfolio of assets is highly contracted in fact by predominantly investment-grade counterparties, which aligns perfectly with our low-risk commercial model. Beyond that, the system has embedded future growth opportunities, which will support growing LNG export volumes. This new JV is a strategic move into a prime gas supply basin, bringing together 3 key Texas midstream partners in an extremely attractive and financially beneficial manner. So now let's take a closer look at Gas Distribution and Storage. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the Enbridge Gas Ohio acquisition on March 6, and we are making great progress on the remaining U.S. gas utilities acquisitions. The integration teams are working hard, and we look forward to continuing to deliver safe, reliable and affordable natural gas to millions of residents and businesses. The Ohio gas utility serves 1.2 million customers and includes rate structures that decouple revenue from volumes, reducing earnings seasonality. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

In addition, over 80% of the capital is subject to recovery riders which allows Enbridge Gas Ohio to recover on that capital in a matter of months rather than years. We continue to work collaboratively with Questar and PSNC's regulatory bodies and expect to close those acquisitions later this year. Turning to our Canadian gas utility. We filed a court appeal and submitted a motion with the OEB to review their December rate rebasing decision for EGI. The court appeal has been placed in abeyance until the OEB review is complete, which we expect could be during the third or fourth quarter of this year. The province of Ontario is enacting the Keep Energy Cost Down Act and we're encouraged that the government of Ontario is taking positive steps to preserve customer choice and affordability. In the meantime, we'll continue to focus on delivering safe and reliable energy to our growing customer base in Ontario and the second phase of the rebasing proceedings. On the operations side, our Dawn Hub continues to serve nearby markets with about 290 Bcf of networking storage capacity, roughly 1/3 of which is nonregulated and available to benefit from improved storage rates. Let's jump into the Renewables section. As mentioned at Investor Day, we like offshore wind in France because of the solid risk-adjusted returns, strong partnerships and long-term government-backed offtake agreements. This focal point is exhibited through the 3 French projects we have coming into service shortly with Fécamp, PGL and Calvados. At Fécamp, all 71 turbines have been installed and the wind farm has begun generating electricity, powering the equivalent of more than 400,000 homes. At Provence Grand Large, all turbines and the floaters have been installed. Now let's pivot to our ESG progress outlined in our 2023 Sustainability Report. Today, we published that 23rd Annual Sustainability Report, and I'm pleased to report great progress towards our environmental, social and governance goals. Since 2018, we've reduced our GHG emissions intensity by 37%. And we're well on our way to net-zero emissions by 2050, having reduced our absolute emissions by 20% and our methane emissions by 40% since 2018. On diversity, we've already met and exceeded our Board targets and have increased our workforce representation in all measurable areas since this time last year. Safety remains our highest priority, of course, and we continue to drive industry-leading standards and achieved a 10% improvement over our previous 3-year average total recordable incident rate. Sustainability is core to Enbridge, and we're committed to meeting the needs of our customers, investors and society as we continue to provide energy in a planet-friendly way everywhere people need it. So now let me turn things over to Pat to walk you through our quarterly financial results, our capital allocation priorities and our growth outlook. Patrick Murray Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2024. It's been another strong quarter operationally, and I'm proud of the teams for successfully closing the acquisition of the Enbridge Gas Ohio on March 6. Utilization was high across all franchises, showcasing continued demand for assets. I'm going to speak primarily about the actual results to date. We've also broken out what we refer to as our base business results, which exclude the contribution from, and the related financings of the U.S. gas utilities and we'll continue to report our base business results for comparison against financial guidance. In the supplementary materials posted on our website, we provided a reconciliation between the 2 for transparency purposes. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1877344873&ts=3119357&ref=l6cin7 4/18

Now on to the results of the business. Year-over-year, first quarter adjusted EBITDA is up 11% and DCF per share of 4%, inclusive of share issued last September to fund the U.S. gas utilities. In Liquids, continued demand for our full-pass system drove strong results particularly on the Mainline and our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast assets, specifically Flanagan South line and the Ingleside export facility. Gas Transmission had another quarter of high utilization and favorable recontracting on storage and transmission assets as well as benefiting from the acquisition of our gas storage facilities at Tres Palacios and Aitken Creek and the new Morrow RNG portfolio. Despite significantly warmer weather in Ontario, which impacted first quarter results by almost $80 million, EGI's results were consistent year-over-year as the Canadian utility benefited from higher rates and increased customer base. Enbridge Gas Ohio, as I noted, closed at the beginning of March and contributed about $50 million of EBITDA in the 24 days of ownership. The Renewables business benefited from increased OEC and Albatros ownership, compounded by strong international wind resources on those same assets as well as contributions from our investments in Fox Squirrel as a result of the generation of investment tax credits. As a reminder, our Energy Services segment is now embedded into the business units, so you will not see it as a stand-alone segment anymore. This change has no impact on our segmented 2024 financial guidance. Eliminations and others up in 2024, owing to the higher investment income and lower operating administrative costs within the quarter. Below the line in DCF per share, higher EBITDA was partially offset by higher interest rates, impacting both floating rate and new debt. And finally, the additional share count from the equity issuance in September of last year also impacted our per share measures. Today, we're also reaffirming base business financial guidance, and we expect to be well within the range. If we are able to close the Utah acquisition within the second quarter as we expect, we'll look to update the full year guidance inclusive of the utility acquisitions on our Q2 call. Before I move on, I want to remind the investment community that our results have implicit seasonality. The first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest financial quarters. Gas consumption at the Ontario utility and gas transmission on our gas pipelines increases during colder months, while refinery turnarounds typically take place in the spring and summer, which means our liquid deliveries are lower during these periods. With that, let's turn to our growth drivers. This slide drives a bit deeper into our secured capital program and optimization opportunities, providing visibility to [ 4% to 5% ] of our overall medium-term growth outlook. As mentioned, our secured growth program now sits at $25 billion. The backlog is heavily weighted towards our Gas Transmission and Utility business and the diversity of projects, both in terms of scope and geography reduces our exposure to inflation or regulatory risk. Also worth pointing out is that our share of capital in Rio Bravo has been reduced in line with our lower interest in the pipeline, as outlined in our joint venture press release in March. On cost savings, we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce overhead, improve productivity and incorporate inflation protection into our commercial agreements on an ongoing basis. Asset optimization, cost management and contract negotiations have historically generated 1% to 2% of annual growth for Enbridge and will remain important drivers of our business going forward. Lastly, I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities that we spoke about at Enbridge Day. With the remaining LDC closes in sight, I'd like to reiterate our continued commitment to balance sheet strength and sustainable capital returns. Our leverage guardrails of 4.5x to 5x debt to EBITDA remain in place and are supported by our industry- leading low-risk business model. The sale of our interest in Alliance, Aux Sable reinforces the balance sheet and ensures continued financial flexibility ahead of the Questar and PSNC closings this year. As I reiterated last quarter and emphasized at Enbridge Day, our focus remains grounded in capital prudency. Our value proposition has always been underpinned by a ratable growing dividend. We've distributed $34 billion to 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1877344873&ts=3119357&ref=l6cin7 5/18

our shareholders over the past 5 years alone, and looking ahead, we expect that figure to grow to roughly $40 billion over the next 5 years, while maintaining our 60% to 70% DCF payout range. We're able to achieve that thanks to the visibility and duration of our multiyear growth outlook. We plan to spend $6 billion to $7 billion per year on our secured growth program. And while we have additional capacity, we don't need to spend it to achieve our growth targets. With that, I'll pass it back to Greg to wrap things up. Gregory Ebel Well, thanks very much, Pat. That's a really nice summary of a very successful first quarter to start the year and of the great progress we've made across all of our businesses. The decisions we're making today are setting the stage for Enbridge to continue growing our dividend and sustainably returning capital to our shareholders for years to come. Over the last 20 years, we've generated an industry-leading average TSR CAGR of 12% through a balance of capital appreciation and dividend growth. Our value drivers are unchanged, unrivaled and quite unique in the midstream sector. We have diversified utility-like cash flows and a strong balance sheet that has supported 29 years of dividend increases, and we maintain an attractive risk-adjusted growth outlook. We benefit from lower carbon optionality throughout our conventional business, which will support affordable and responsibly paced global energy transition. Our strong value fundamentals are expected to continue delivering attractive shareholder returns, making Enbridge your first-choice investment opportunity. Thank you all, and now let's open the line for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC. Robert Catellier I wondered if you could give us your updated view on financial markets and asset sale markets. And how you're weighing capital recycling versus other options for funding utility acquisitions, notably the ATM. Gregory Ebel Yes, Robert, maybe I'll start and maybe Pat will want to add here. Look, I think you've seen lots of asset sales. People have adjusted to higher interest rates. And you can see, what I would argue, a more robust market today for asset sales. And as you know, we've done well in excess of $10 billion in asset sales since 2018. So that's always on the table. I think what we want to make sure, and I think what we're doing is making sure that we've got maximum flexibility, maximum optionality and preparedness to complete the last 10% or so of the financing. So no decisions have been made, but obviously, everything on the table. And we think that probably gives us the best opportunity given the markets, given we're not exactly sure when the transactions are going to close. So all that being said, highly confident we'll get that all closed. In fact, I guess if you had regulatory approval today, you could actually just close them all right now, too. So I think we're set up with everything still on the table, maximum flexibility and that's going to create the best opportunity to maximize value. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1877344873&ts=3119357&ref=l6cin7 6/18

Robert Catellier Okay. My next question, just wondering if you could update us on how the U.S. Gulf Coast crude oil export market is evolving. Specifically in the short-to-medium term here, we have a number of impacts, refinery maintenance in Europe, less Mexican exports and the indirect impacts from the startup of TMX? Colin Gruending Yes. Sure, Robert. Colin here. So yes, it sounds like you're on top of it. It's still pretty robust. Certainly, the light- export market is on. You can see that Permian supply is up, and we're seeing strong throughputs off the dock. And likewise, on the heavy-export market or even just maybe even further upstream a little bit, just heavy into the U.S. Gulf market itself is still robust. Like you said, we're seeing Mexican oil staying home and it is creating more room for the Canadian heavy barrel, which were a strategy we've worked on for a long time, and we're going to bring on EHOT here soon to help our plumbing in that area. So we're watching that closely. It sounds like you are too, it remains pretty robust. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Robert Hope Wanted to follow up on the commentary in the prepared remarks on increasing gas demand related to data centers. How large of an opportunity would this be for your gas pipeline systems and specifically, kind of when do you think you could start to see some expansions being required? Gregory Ebel Sure. Well, and I'll turn it over to Cynthia. I guess, lots of numbers out there for sure, Robert. And lots of predictions. I think it's early to be quite honest. But in any event, it's going to be positive from a power and gas demand perspective. So whether it's on the power side, 0.5% to 1.5% increase through 2030 or I've seen numbers from 5 Bcf up to 16 Bcf. I think we're well situated. It's not just the pipelines, but I'll turn it over to Cynthia. Maybe we'll ask Michele and Matthew to make a comment, too. Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks. Rob, we are excited by this opportunity, obviously, to help build out the supporting infrastructure for the natural gas generation to support AI data centers. Our GTM assets are really well located. We're within 50 miles of 45% of all the natural gas power generation in North America. So we are going to be in a position to build that out. As you look to timeline, just like Greg said, there'll be some opportunities in the near term, just depending on what your capacity and availability is and location. And so we look forward to that. And in the longer term, it seems to be really positive. Michele? 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1877344873&ts=3119357&ref=l6cin7 7/18

Michele Harradence Sure. Rob, what we're finding as we're speaking to customers about data centers is they're typically looking for reliable and affordable electricity in locally supportive jurisdictions. So the jurisdictions we currently -- are certainly the ones we will operate in, whether that's Utah, North Carolina or Ohio, they offer that really very much hand-in-hand with gas-fired generation. So to the degree that there is data growth in those regions, we certainly expect there will be data growth -- center growth in those regions will certainly play a role. Matthew Akman It's Matthew. Just quickly on Renewables, demand for Renewables is already very strong. And I think the data center stuff just enhances that. Large tech companies are really our kind of customers. And I think we're their kind of developer, we've got a reliable offering, we can deliver. We've got interconnection agreements ready to go and the capabilities. So just adds another tailwind for our Renewable business. Gregory Ebel Yes. Good setup. And we didn't mention storage, but given people want to jump on stuff so obviously, as you know, we've got 600 Bs or so of storage across the continent, that's going to be powerful, too. Robert Hope All right. And then maybe just switching over to the heavy and the crude oil system. Interestingly, we're talking about expansions as Trans Mountain is ramping up. But even still, it does seem like there's an increasing pull of heavy to the Gulf Coast. So how have discussions with shippers formed regarding kind of the next phase of expansions of heavy capacity out of Alberta? And what do you think the pacing or timing will be of your phased expansions on the Mainline? Colin Gruending Sure. Robert, Colin. Yes. So indeed, now that we've got the multiyear tolling deal done. It's kind of cleared the way and the table for discussions with shippers. On the next series of things to do in the job jar, expanding the system or even just continuing to optimize the system, which we've been doing over and over again, are on the table right now. We're in discussions with shippers currently, and we've got some offerings in front of them that are relatively capital efficient, executable permitting-wise, with a view to keeping some open egress here through the whole piece so that prices are higher. So that's the objective. Timing wise, you're going to see optimizations continue from us serially here, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter and then chunkier expansions in the 100,000 a day category in the next 2 years, which would pair up pretty well with, I think, the forecast we've been conveying around the system refilling within that period of time. So that's the current discussion and plan, which is consistent with what we've had for the last year or two. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Pham from BMO. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1877344873&ts=3119357&ref=l6cin7 8/18

Benjamin Pham On the recent -- Capital Power, they shelved their CCS project, how does that impact your -- in any way for your Wabamun project? Colin Gruending Ben, it's Colin. I can take that. Yes. So that's disappointing. And I think as Capital Power noted, the project is technically viable, but just economically unviable for a number of reasons, including governmental support for it. Notwithstanding, we've got a kind of a sister project at the Wabamun Hub with Heidelberg materials for their cement plant in Northwest Edmonton. So that project has garnered some more financial support, and we'll be working with them to consider FID later this year. So the Wabamun Open Access Hub will generally continue. We've incurred some very modest capital costs in preparing for Capital Power, but we have a reimbursement agreement with them. So it's recovered. So that's our update on that hub. But more broadly, we remain keenly interested in growing our carbon capture and transportation and sequester business. Across North America, we've got a couple of other projects under development, as you know, in the States, namely, Texas. So that's a broad update. Gregory Ebel Ben, it's an interesting one because I think it's a good example of even in some of these new technologies where there appears to be a lot of government support, they're going to be highly competitive, right? As Colin said, the Heidelberg project looks quite good. And then you're going to compare jurisdictions, we sure do. And I think Capital Power sounds like they are too and just the NPV of tax benefits in Canada versus the U.S. for CCUS. It's just more attractive to down South. So we're real careful how we deal with this. As Colin said, we've got reimbursement agreement there, but we're going to keep pursuing these. And I think, much like a lot of other things, there are probably fewer of these than more -- than obviously the proposals that are out there. We're going to do this really disciplined, and it sounds like they are as well. Benjamin Pham Okay. And maybe on the Ingleside, just going back to that and the strong volumes, the windows that you're talking about, what do you think your expectation is in terms of capital deployment each year going forward? And maybe just an update on specific developments like solar generation, ammonia exports, anything that's been notable over the last quarter or two. Colin Gruending Sure, Ben. So yes, I mean we consider Ingleside as like kind of a Swiss army knife, multiproduct ambition. Currently, it's just crude. But over time, all the advantages that -- more crudes advantage off that dock are portable to other products, purity products, blue ammonia, which we're developing. So we've announced a couple of expansions at Ingleside now, right, just for storage, and we've got headroom there with both permitting for storage and docks. As you know, we acquired -- or announced, we have to close that yet later this year with the docks next door, which are going to basically double the windows, and we can immediately optimize the loading 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

of smaller vessels at the neighboring docks and reserve our legacy docks for the VLCCs. And by the way, we've deepened our dock there to 54 feet now. So we can -- not fully load, but 1.6 million barrels a day of a 2 million- barrel at VLCC. So that's pretty efficient capital deployment. To your question over time, we'd like to copy-paste that model, if you like, to other products. We're still looking at the blue ammonia project with Yara. And the FID on that would be over a year away yet, but that would be a chunkier capital deployment. But the commercial models we're looking at would be utility-like and strong margins over a hurdle rate. So hopefully, that gets to your question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Theresa Chen First, on the Gas Transmission side. Related to the Whistler JV acquisition, just curious on how you think about optimizing or how this optimizes your portfolio over time? And related to the mention of organic growth opportunities on this. Clearly, we're seeing very tight Permian egress right now and the need for additional capacity out of Waha. Do you view additional expansion opportunities on Whistler likely? Or would you be willing to take part of another greenfield egress solution? Cynthia Hansen Yes. Theresa, it's Cynthia. Thanks for that question. We're really excited about this opportunity with this joint venture. It is, as you mentioned, very strategic. Permian has an opportunity to grow to support all the activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, including the LNG expansion in terminals there. We see right now, obviously, Rio Bravo with our contribution there will be a new build-out to support that LNG, so that will eventually have an opportunity to take incremental gas out of the Permian. Now there will be opportunities, both brownfield and greenfield. And so we'll continue to look at that. And we'll look at -- we think we'll be able to get attractive returns and help extend that footprint even more. But again, it will have to meet our threshold, and that's further out. But yes, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to build out and enhance what we believe is our super system already by having that incremental connectivity. And now, of course, with the Whistler JV we'll be tied to all of the existing LNG facilities because we get the connection to Cheniere's Corpus Christi LNG facility. Gregory Ebel Yes. I guess we also look at opportunities outside the JV as well as they come along, right? Areas like Port Arthur and stuff like that. So I think we're open to any, but I think it actually creates good optionality down into the Corpus area, et cetera, with the JV. And then we're continuing to look at other opportunities because frankly, we haven't been as deep into the Permian as some other players. Cynthia Hansen Yes. And we do have, as Greg noted, an open season right now from Permian to Port Arthur provider that's going to close on May 20, and we have a lot of interest. So it's a great opportunity to support the development there. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 11
Theresa Chen Got it. And then maybe turning back to the Liquids segment. I wanted to follow up on the line of questioning related to TMX ramping up and how everything is tracking within your internal budget. As we look to second quarter, right, so you have the line fill happening right now and then you have a seasonal producer maintenance upstream. Just quarter-over-quarter, given the strong earnings, not just on your Mainline system in the first quarter, but also Express-Platte and the systems South of Mainline. Would we expect to see some alleviation or a decrease in volumes from those systems, even as Mainline remains a portion just at a lower level. How should we think about the evolution of that for the year? Colin Gruending Theresa, Colin. Yes, I guess, we normally reserve to late June to update you on volumes for Q2, but maybe a let's sneak a peek here. So line fill is complete, I think, on TMX, it's flowing. And from what we can tell, it looks like that was all line filled from inventory, elevated inventories anticipated going into it. So we've not really seen a blip on our system here through April or May. And likewise, our downstream pipes remain pretty robust. So I think the thesis we've been offering here is unfolding like we thought it would. So I'll stop short of giving you a volume numbers, but that's a general trend. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Linda Ezergailis from TD Cowen. Linda Ezergailis I'm wondering as we see economic demand increasing from data centers and onshoring of industrial demand et cetera and the supply response working as hard as it can to meet that. I'm wondering when you look out through your system and see any pinch points along the transportation value chain, how important is it for your customers, whether it be producers or end users like utilities or, in the future, data centers to have full-path solutions from you on the gas side, you don't have upstream gathering. So I'm wondering if that might be an extension of your value chain consideration as we see kind of more complexity in terms of these molecules traversing through the system. And then similarly, on the Liquids side, are your shippers sophisticated enough to navigate all the steps in the value chain? Or are you seeing increasingly demand and interest in bundled services full -- more full path? Gregory Ebel Linda, maybe I'll start and then maybe Colin and Cynthia want to chime in too here. Look, I mean, we're seeing incredible utilization of the assets, right? So see -- take a place like British Columbia, like -- we've just seen unbelievable elements of peak days that have gone through there. We saw the West Coast South system, almost 600 Bs of gas in 2023, which is 6% more than a year ago. And 99 of our top 100 days on [indiscernible] have occurred since November 22. So people are looking for that path. As you know, we're looking to develop that. They're also looking to storage. As you know, we've bought Aitken Creek. We're not in the gathering side in a big 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 12
way now. But if we could do that in a way that's consistent with our low-risk model, that's something we would definitely look at. And then, yes, on the liquids side, I mean, not only are our customers plenty sophisticated to look at this. I think we're doing a great job with the customer team in Colin's Group of figuring out ways that we can bring innovative solutions to them full path, right? So -- and you see that with the number of our -- whether it's open seasons in the Gulf Coast or our efforts on Flanagan and et cetera, and obviously, the Mainline Tolling Agreement. So -- yes, I think on all fronts, we're -- we see they want a full path, and we see they want lots of optionality. And I would even include the utilities now in that regard, too, and look at a place like Ohio, where we've got all those assets available, whether it's renewable, gas, liquids and you've got data center activity and stuff. So I think we've got the full suite of tools, and that's exactly what we're trying to be able to do to benefit them and ourselves and our investors, obviously. I don't know Cynthia or Colin? Colin Gruending I would just -- I think, Linda, your observation is right. Value chains are getting longer, right? We can see that with TMX, we see that heavy down at the Gulf. So customers are sophisticated for sure, but there are -- that last-mile element that is in, let's call it, increasingly foreign territory where we can help navigate that with the facilities or integrated tools, think about something like EHOT or even something like the Seaway docks down in South Texas. Those are incrementally kind of new to the equation over the last couple of years. Cynthia Hansen Yes. I would just reinforce the point that we're always looking to listen to what our customers want and having new customers come in on the AI data center space, we'll look at how we can evolve that. But they are very sophisticated, and there are other players in that space, marketers that can help build out that full value chain too. But our assets are in great locations, and we'll be well positioned to take advantage of that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet I just wanted to pick up on that last point, I guess, a bit more. Having closed the Ohio LDC acquisition, I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit more, I guess, on specific opportunities you see for growth in your footprint such as NEXUS running through the state, and it seems like there's some capacity to expand there and having the LDCs. Just wondering if you could walk us through that a bit more. Michele Harradence Sure. I mean we're certainly starting to take a look at it. It's been about 2 months. It's gone really well. And Ohio is very, very well served with its position in terms of having that access and availability to gas. We also have about 80 Bcf of storage just in Ohio and, of course, access to the Dawn Hub. So we think there's quite a few opportunities. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

We're also looking for where we have similar customers. So for example, whether that's steel manufacturing that's using and converting to natural gas in order to reduce their emissions and that sort of things. So we think there are quite a few opportunities. And the team has been going in pretty deep to look for them. Gregory Ebel Remember, Jeremy, also that Ohio is interesting and that a lot of the growth there isn't so much about load, although -- we'll see how that goes and we believe in it. It's a lot about replacement too, which is structured in the rates and stuff. And as there's a lot of capital to go in that regard. So anything incremental on these commercial synergies we're talking, which we fully expect we'll be able to realize is -- was not something we had assumed in our acquisition assumptions. So all that will be upside. Jeremy Tonet Got it. That's very helpful. And as you start to close these LDC acquisitions, just wondering if you could talk a bit more, I guess, on how you think about your LDC portfolio. And if EGI doesn't deliver the mechanisms that are as attractive as maybe some of your other jurisdictions, I guess, the potential to wheel capital around to where you see the best opportunity? Gregory Ebel Yes, absolutely. I think it's exactly the same way now with multiple jurisdictions and geographies the same way, we look at Gas Transmission on the Renewables side and on the Liquids side. You -- we only -- you only have so much capital a; and b, we want to put that capital to work where it attracts the best returns. I am confident that, particularly with the support from the Ontario government and ensuring that consumers have choice that we'll have our opportunities in Ontario. But you're exactly right. Just given things like population growth and penetration in places like Utah and North Carolina, that's going to be highly competitive. And fortunately, we've got the resources and backing to be able to meet all those. So yes, that's exactly what we want to be able to do. And again, we see it on the Liquids side as well. We've redeployed a lot of capital into the Gulf Coast, where we weren't. And at the same time, now we've got egress opportunities, which I'm not sure many people were seeing 2 years ago. But once again, the good old Mainline in Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is proving a robust area. And then yes, of course, on the Gas Transmission side, whether it's on the on the LNG side. A lot of our capital, I would say, has moved south in the last few years. Eventually, the Northeast is going to have to do something, and that will create opportunities, too. So -- and obviously, around the Great Lakes. I mean, it is the benefit of portfolio. Not all jurisdictions are going to be the most attractive at the time. But when you've got assets in 43 states and 8 provinces in 5 countries, you can make those capital allocation decisions with great discipline. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1877344873&ts=3119357&ref=l6cin7 13/18

If I can just start on the Dominion funding side of things. And you made a comment that you expect to exit the deal funded well within the 4.5x to 5x. I'm just wondering if you can square that out. I think at the outset of the deal, you were targeting being at the midpoint or even in the lower half of the range and just in achieving whatever the target is now -- do you think you can do that within the levers that avoids the usage of the... Patrick Murray Well, I think, Robert, as Greg said, we'll look at all the levers that we have to complete what is really just about 10%, 15% of the overall funding for that acquisition. Really the goal behind getting some of that -- or a big chunk of that financing done early on in the process was allow us as much flexibility as we have to kind of do what we need to do throughout 2024 to close off the rest of the funding. So I think we're really comfortable that we can fund this in a way that maintains us well within that 4.5x to 5x. And that's how we'll move forward on the funding. Robert Kwan Okay. As you -- also just things on -- I'll finish here on capital allocation and just your approach to thinking about your payout. When you look at your earnings profile and you've really focused more on DCF payout versus earnings payout. So just what are the accounting measures that differ sustainably over the long term versus your view of the true economics underlying your assets? And specifically, you've got about $1 billion of maintenance CapEx. How much of that is coming from your Gas Distribution segment? Patrick Murray So I think about half of the current maintenance capital is coming from the Distribution unit. It'll go up a bit as we acquire these 3 utilities in the U.S. as we go around. I think if you're asking kind of what the difference between EPS and DCF is, it really is that primarily that difference between depreciation and what we would call maintenance capital. But I think the important thing to know about with our assets, of course, is that if you maintain your assets appropriately like we believe we do, their life is almost non-ending. And so as a result, you can utilize these assets for a very long period of time. So when we look at our payout, what we're really looking at is that cash flow generation and how sustainable that is and therefore, make kind of dividend increase decisions based on it. That's why we've been guiding for a number of years now that we're going to grow that dividend in line with how we grow cash flow. So I think cash is king in our mind within this business. And so we make sure that, that's sustainable and then we make our dividend recommendations based on that. And our plan would be to continue to grow the dividend in line with cash flows. Operator Your next question from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish So as it relates to the funding for the LDC acquisition, you mentioned the levers that you have. But I mean it looks like Q1 was incrementally strong. So is there a scenario here where you generate more EBITDA than expected 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

this year and therefore get to where you need to be from a leverage perspective and avoid having to sell more assets or ATM issuance? Or is it too early to think that? Just trying to think through the dynamics there. Gregory Ebel Yes, I think it's a little early. I think what we're really trying to do, Praneeth, is making sure we've got that maximum flexibility. Again, we haven't come to any conclusions where we're -- you're right, very strong quarter. As you know, we've got some seasonality in our year in the first quarter and the fourth quarter are always much stronger. I think what we'll do is, as Pat mentioned in his early commentary, I believe, that as we get the assets in the door here, and I expect you'll see this as we announce second quarter, give you a good outlook for the full economics of the transaction, if you will, and what the full year will look like on a fully loaded basis. So I think that will give you a good view at this time. Yes, I mean, look, we came into the year stronger and finished stronger than we thought. We've started the first quarter stronger than a lot of people were looking for, and we felt we would have a strong start. And I believe we've been able to execute both on the funding to date and getting these assets in the house much quicker than we thought. From an energy fundamentals perspective, I've mentioned some of the things going on in the gas side. I mean -- I think you got to give it to us that the LP team have been bang on their expectations of what would happen with volumes and stuff, and we're nailing those. So yes, optimistic start to the year, but we'll come back and talk to you in August exactly how the full year will look. Praneeth Satish That's very helpful. And then on Gray Oak, so good to see the open season started there. Do you think producers though are waiting to see the outcome of some of these potential offshore VLCC docks like SPOT before committing more barrels to Corpus? And then, I guess, just broadly, how do you think about the risks to your Corpus footprint if one of those offshore projects get sanctioned maybe how much of your volume flowing into Ingleside is backed by take-or-pay contracts? Colin Gruending Praneeth, thanks for the question. So as you know, the basin is tightening serially here every quarter as more production comes on, and by the way, Corpus, I think is trading at $0.30 or $0.40 premium to Houston, just for distance and loading advantages. So there's a structural advantage to Corpus. We think the timing of this open season, and we've [ found ] customers, it's going to fit their pistol. I think with your question with respect to offshore buoys, I think if that were to go ahead or one of them go ahead, I think the competitors that would suffer most are the smaller, probably Houston-based ship channel, less economic docks, whereas I think the Corpus docks will remain advantaged. So we see a pretty positive outlook for Gray Oak and Ingleside. I think you asked a question about take-or-pays. So Ingleside is take-or-pay for us entirely. And it's fed by and connected to all 5 pipes from the Permian and shippers typically have a take-or-pay on that. One of them is Gray Oak, which we own most of. So it's basically a take-or-pay model for us all the way to the dock. Operator 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 16
Your next question comes from the line Zackery Van Everen from TPH. Zackery Van Everen Perfect. Just a follow-up on Gray Oak. When that open season wraps, how fast will that volume come online? Colin Gruending Yes. Thanks. So open season scheduled to close June 28, and we'll bring the capacity on in 2 tranches, 2/3 of it in the second quarter of 2025 and the other piece of it a number of months later. So that's how we see it coming on relatively quickly, and it's a very capital efficient, low multiple expansion for us mostly drag-reducing agent, a couple of tanks, pretty executable. Zackery Van Everen Perfect. That makes sense. And then maybe flipping to the gas side. on your Venice project. I saw you guys delivered a little bit of gas to the Gator Express pipeline. Maybe an update on the timeline for that facility or that project to be online. Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks for the question, Zack. It's under construction now, and we're working to get that in by the end of the year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Kenny from National Bank Financial. Patrick Kenny Just maybe on your power business on the back of the Tennessee Ridgeline expansion. And as you talked about this new demand profile for more reliable baseload capacity, whether it's from data centers or other industrial customers. Curious if you might be open to integrating combined cycle or other gas-fired opportunities now within your power segment. Assuming you can maintain your long-term utility-like contracted profile. Matthew Akman Pat, it's Matthew. Thanks for the question. It's not really on our radar to expand into gas-fired right now. We think that you're right that the data centers and a lot of these customers obviously want reliable 24/7 power, but they also want the renewable credits. So you'll see gas-fired will be, I think, a real important part of meeting this increased electricity demand, but so will renewable and then the customer will take sort of that combined bundled 24/7 power plus RECs up the grid. So we're very focused on building out, as we talked at Investor Day, are late-stage projects that have interconnection agreements. And we'll work with the gas-fired and obviously, with Cynthia's business in order to make sure customers get the product that they need. I think longer term, you're right, there's a potential for us, potential for gas fired. But again, 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 17
we're not really focused on it right now, and it would have to meet our commercial model, utility-like contracts, but again, not a focus right now. Gregory Ebel Probably the biggest pop we're going to see from power generation on the gas side will be in Cynthia's business. And remember, a lot of gas-fired generation is still 50%, 60% utilization, it can definitely go up. A lot of gas-fired generation does not have long-term contracts, that could happen. And because typically, it's been -- we haven't had as long of utilization full year for the pipelines, now we do. So there's probably going to be a requirement for some of the gas-fired generation folks to firm up, and that's on storage as well. But yes, we'll keep our eyes open. And I don't think there's any doubt electricity demand is going up. Patrick Kenny Yes, that's great. And Greg, maybe just a follow-up on your comments there around gas storage. Just curious in light of the extreme cold out West here in the quarter and perhaps a view towards more extreme highs and lows in terms of temperatures going forward. If you're seeing incremental demand from customers for more storage capacity and how you're thinking about this opportunity from a brownfield, greenfield or perhaps M&A standpoint? Gregory Ebel Yes. Maybe taking your last one first. We did -- I think the team was on it and ahead of the game when we picked up assets on the storage side last year, both Tres and Aitken Creek and others have stepped in there now. And yes, we continue to add additional cavern space where we can from a brownfield perspective. I would say also on the Distribution side, we see that, and let's not forget, 1/3 of our Distribution storage in Ontario is market-based. So Cynthia, do you want to make any comments on what you're seeing from a pricing or even term perspective? Cynthia Hansen Yes. So we've seen our re-contracting prices go up from 100% to 150%. So there's really strong demand for that. We're bringing on a little bit more this year with Tres cavern 4, so that will be on by the end of the year. We continue to get inbounds for looking at what we can do brownfield and even greenfield. I mean, it'd have to be a pretty big demand to get across that and that would take more time. but we'll look to optimize the existing structures that we have. Michele Harradence I was just going to say on the GDS side, we're seeing very similar things to what -- at Dawn, to what Cynthia quoted in terms of just the re-contracting rates, but a lot of customers, who previously maybe were just a couple of years that they were signing up for, are going up to 4, even 5 years.

Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Manav Gupta Just one question. What should be the CapEx cadence. Once you get into this -- once you close your utility acquisitions, what would be the CapEx cadence for 2025 or so? Patrick Murray Yes. We've kind of guided to the fact that we've got a run rate of $6 billion to $7 billion of growth CapEx on an annual basis, got a little more capacity than that, but we'll be very selective in how we use that. So that's our growth CapEx number that we've been talking about. Gregory Ebel All of which is consistent with equity self-financing, which is important to us, and I know is to investors as well.

We'll also be referring to non-GAAP measures summarized below. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg Ebel. Gregory Ebel Well, thanks very much, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to be here to highlight the significant progress we've made on our strategic priorities and to discuss our strong second quarter results. I'll start by providing a midyear update outlining the team's strong execution of our financial, operational and growth priorities. We've accomplished exactly what we said we would and then some, and look forward to continuing the momentum through the balance of the year. I'll give an overview on the utilities acquisitions and highlight what the team has managed to accomplish since we announced the deal less than a year ago. I'll also provide an update on each of the businesses and highlight key developments there. And then before having Pat take us through the details of the financial results, I'll take the opportunity to share how we are seeing our scale and  󰍉 ENB 󰍝  3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

connectivity, extending growth and providing opportunities across all our 4 business franchises. And more specifically, how we're seeing this play out in the market with growing power, natural gas and oil demand. As some of you have heard me say, you can't run a full-time economy on part-time power, and Enbridge is in a position to serve our customers and their growing demand full time through multiple service offerings. Once Pat wraps up, I'll close with a few key messages, and then our management team will be pleased to answer questions following our presentation. Before I jump into the progress we've made this year, I want to acknowledge everyone impacted by the ongoing wildfires in Northern Alberta and British Columbia. We're committed to supporting our partners, customers and communities during this challenging time. And while we've seen no impact on the operations to date, safety will be our #1 priority as we continue to monitor the situation. Now on to the midyear update. As you can see, we've achieved or made significant headway on the commitments we laid out at the start of the year. I'm pleased to share that the U.S. Gas Utilities acquisition funding is now fully complete. Moving forward, we don't see returning to the public markets for the equity portion of our capital needs, and consistent with that, we have now canceled our ATM program. I'm pleased to report our base business performance is very much on track through the first half of the year. Separately, you will see that we are recasting our full year financial outlook, by adding to that original 2024 guidance, the expected contributions from the 2 U.S. gas utilities we have closed. We expect the closing of PSNC and all of the associated acquisition financings. Pat will talk more about this later in the call. Our balance sheet remains strong with debt to EBITDA well within our targeted range at 4.7x, providing financial flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities. I'm really proud of the team's execution and focus on operational safety and excellence. So far this year, we've had strong asset performance with high utilization across our franchises. As an example, just look at what's happening in Liquids. During the second quarter, we achieved record volumes on the Mainline and at our Ingleside export facility. As mentioned, we've closed 2 of the 3 U.S. gas utilities that we acquired, representing what will ultimately be approximately 80% of the total annualized EBITDA and have reached a settlement in principle with the Public Staff for the North Carolina Utilities Commission. PSNC remains on track to close in Q3. We're also pleased to have reached a prepackaged rate settlement on our Texas Eastern pipeline with customers. This reflects our continued focus on optimizing our return on assets to ensure we are earning a reasonable return while delivering safe and reliable energy for customers. And I'm pleased to report that the FERC has now approved this customer settlement. On growth, we've made good progress executing opportunities in our development pipeline. We sanctioned the 130-megawatt Orange Grove solar project in Texas backed by a long-term PPA with AT&T. Through our Whistler joint venture, we have reached final investment decision for the Blackcomb Pipeline, which will provide up to 2.5 Bcf of much-needed natural gas egress for Permian shippers. And we sanctioned an expansion of our Gray Oak Pipeline in our Liquids business. With clear line of sight to the U.S. Gas Utilities acquisition closing, let me take a moment to highlight our strong execution of that transaction. We are ahead of our plan to complete the $19 billion acquisition of these 3 gas utilities that we announced just last September. This reinforces our proven track record of effective M&A execution and highlights the strength of our relationships with all our stakeholders, including customers, regulators and governments right across North America. Federal approvals were all received in due course with the closing of East Ohio Gas occurring well before our expectations in early March. We look forward to 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

continuing to build long-term productive relationships with all stakeholders in Ohio as we integrate that premier utility business. Next, we announced the closing of Questar and Wexpro in early June. Again, our experience and relationships helped ensure timely regulatory approvals were obtained to welcome a growing multistate utility into our Enbridge family ahead of expectations. Integration is going well so far, and we will continue to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers throughout the transition. In North Carolina, we are on track to receive regulatory approval and close in Q3. The team's dedication to executing these transactions, completing the financing and integrating these assets, which diversify our business and enhance our stable cash flow and growth profile has been first rate. Now let's jump into the exceptional performance at each of the BUs. We saw high utilization across our liquids system once again this quarter. This highlights the demand-pull nature of our systems and continued need for crude oil to fuel everyday life in North America and beyond. The Mainline transported record second quarter volumes of 3.1 million barrels per day and has so far been apportioned for all months in 2024. July volumes are also expected to be strong, and we're expecting apportionment again in August. The utilization year-to-date and the great macro backdrop keeps us confident in our 3 million barrels per day estimate on the Mainline for 2024 and underpins discussions with customers for expansions in 2026 and beyond. I will also note that this marks our first full year under the new Mainline Tolling Settlement. The agreement has proven to be a win-win-win for us, our customers and the markets we serve. And as a reminder, we have annual toll inflators for operating expenses and power that were effective July 1. We are also earning in the upper half of the ROE performance collar. In the Permian, we sanctioned 120,000 barrel per day expansion of the Gray Oak Pipeline, following a successful open season this quarter, and expect this expansion will come fully online in 2026. The incremental volumes will serve growing demand at our Ingleside facility, and we expect the expansion to be capital efficient with an EBITDA multiple below 5x. We now have 18 million barrels of storage capacity at Ingleside with an additional 2.5 million barrels under construction. Of note, Ingleside also set a quarterly record for exports and saw a single-day loading record of more than 2.3 million barrels. This again underscores our belief that cash flow from that asset will be sustainable and growing for many years to come. Now let's take a look at Gas Transmission. We optimized our assets and advanced our U.S. Gulf Coast strategy during the quarter. As mentioned on Texas Eastern, we reached and the FERC approved a negotiated settlement with shippers effective October 1. Base rates are expected to increase by 6% through 2025 with an additional uplift of approximately 3% in 2026. In the Permian, we closed the previously announced acquisition of an interest in the Whistler JV, which brought into service the ADCC Pipeline on July 1. That asset will support U.S. LNG exports to global markets. In addition, the JV recently reached FID for the Blackcomb Pipeline after securing firm transportation agreements. When completed in 2026, Blackcomb is expected to add up to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day of desperately needed natural gas egress for our Permian customers. The Venice extension, another project serving LNG exports on the Louisiana coast through the Plaquemines LNG facility, is on budget and on track to enter service later this year. Now let's move on to our Gas Distribution segment. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of Questar and Wexpro at the end of May, and we are well on our way to creating the largest natural gas utility in North America and expect North Carolina to close in the third quarter. As a reminder, each of these utilities have 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

attributes that position us for long-term growth. Enbridge Utah is a fully regulated gas utility that serves more than 1.2 million customers, and we are excited about the data center opportunities we are seeing there. Utah's projected population growth is 5% annually through at least 2028, which we expect to drive rate base growth for years to come. Enbridge Gas Utah rates are effective until 2026. In Ontario, we have almost 4 million customers and expect residential and industrial growth as well as system modernization will backstop ongoing rate base growth in Ontario. In Ohio, we have another 1.2 million customers connected to our utility. We expect to continue growing rate base through necessary investments, which will modernize existing infrastructure, ensuring reliable and affordable energy for our customers. Enbridge Gas Ohio has a rate case ongoing with new rates expected in 2025. All of our utilities, including PSNC, which we expect to close in the coming months, have attractive returns on equity and are located in natural gas supportive jurisdictions. Now let's turn to the renewables business. And we made great progress on the growth commitments laid out at our Investor Day for that business. We previously announced a plan to develop the Seven Stars wind project in Saskatchewan with FID expected in 2025. This 200-megawatt wind farm will have greater than 30% indigenous participation and is backed by government loan guarantees. The project is expected to provide emissions-free power to more than 100,000 Saskatchewan homes, and is a great example of how the cross-pollination of our business units is generating growth. Moving on to solar. We expect to complete our investment in Fox Squirrel Phase 2 in Q3. Similar to Phase 1, Phase 2 is backed by a long-term PPA with Amazon for 100% of the energy production. We also sanctioned the 130-megawatt Orange Grove solar project in Texas with an in-service expected in 2025. This project is backed by a long-term PPA with AT&T for 100% of the offtake. In our conversations, we're finding more and more that hyperscalers value the reliability, experience and proven track record that Enbridge brings to the table as a truly diversified energy provider. And finally, Fécamp is now fully operational, supplying nearly 770,000 people with low-carbon electricity across the Seine-Maritime region in France. With 4 growing franchises and gas utility acquisitions almost complete, let's take a look at Enbridge's collective offering and why we're positioned to benefit from growing global demand. Our asset footprint makes up North America's first choice energy provider. In fact, we don't just have assets, we have franchises in each of the businesses where we're involved. Each of those franchises contain super system, which are integrated value chains connecting the best supply basins in North America to key domestic demand markets and export terminals. Strong relationships with governments, regulatory and tribal bodies makes us the first choice for energy delivery within the jurisdictions we serve. We have a strong track record of operational excellence, utilizing technology and innovation to drive efficiencies. Diversification and asset interconnectivity makes us a one-stop shop, which attracts high-quality customers and partners like AT&T, Amazon, Exxon, BP, Suncor and NextEra, to name but a few. Lower carbon optionality exists throughout our balanced conventional portfolio, and we plan to focus on investments that match the pace of global energy transition. And importantly, we believe all of these growth opportunities can be equity self-funded through our strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. Scale and connectivity are key competitive advantages that are driving new growth opportunities, so let me touch on those briefly. Our large incumbent asset position allows us to provide differentiated service offerings that is driving value for our customers. It's still in the early innings for us fully realizing the advantage of our vast position, but we're seeing growing opportunities across our footprint due to increasing natural gas and renewable power demand and their interconnectivity. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

As an example, in our gas utility business, data center growth in Utah is being driven by the need for reliable and affordable energy. New this quarter, we added 50 megawatts under contract and have numerous additional inquiries to provide natural gas for up to an additional 1.5 gigawatts of capacity. Throughout our utility footprint, we are engaged in additional early-stage discussions with data centers that we expect to translate into future growth. In Gas Transmission, our assets are ideally located and well connected. We are within 50 miles of 45% of all natural gas power generation in North America. In fact, in July, we achieved 7 of our highest-ever daily deliveries to U.S. power plants from our gas transmission system. We've had a range of customers in the U.S. Southeast expressed interest in securing approximately 700 million cubic feet a day of transmission capacity to serve up to 5,000 megawatts of new gas-fired demand. In renewable power, our scale, financial and execution capabilities are differentiators. Data centers need baseload power solutions, such as natural gas, to support the 24/7 energy demands of hyperscalers, but many customers are balancing that reliability requirement with their renewable energy commitments. It's not always possible to co-locate or develop behind-the-meter power solutions to support new data centers. So we are having discussions with large blue-chip customers to provide traditional and virtual long-term PPAs. Virtual long- term PPAs are where customers may look at signing long-term offtake agreements to support development of clean energy projects to offset emissions produced elsewhere in the business. We have over 2 gigawatts of regionally diverse wind and solar projects in development that we talked about at Investor Day, which are capable of serving new data center load with in-service expectations in 2026 and beyond. The collective strength of our franchises lends well to the growth opportunities in front of us, and I'm confident Enbridge will play an essential role, delivering energy everywhere people need it. With that, I'll pass it over to Pat to walk through yet another strong quarter of financial results. Patrick Murray Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. It's been a very strong quarter for Enbridge. And as Greg noted, we had continued high utilization across all of our franchises. Questar closed in May, and we've now brought in roughly 80% of the total annualized U.S. LDC EBITDA in-house. I'll be speaking to adjusted results on this slide. Inclusive of the utility acquisitions, year-over-year, second quarter adjusted EBITDA is up 8% and DCF per share of $1.34 includes a higher share count from all the prefunding of the U.S. Gas Utilities. Liquids volumes were high across the board with the Mainline transporting 3.1 million barrels per day, a second quarter record. Ingleside also broke its previously quarterly and daily records for export volumes. In GTM, lower operating costs as well as the Aitken Creek and Tomorrow RNG acquisitions more than offset the sale of Alliance and Aux Sable on April 1. A full quarter of Enbridge Gas Ohio and partial contributions from our Questar acquisition added approximately $175 million of EBITDA as compared to Q2 in 2023. And in Canada, a higher distribution margin and customer additions over the last year helped offset the negative impact of warm weather at our Ontario utility. Below the line, higher financing costs on floating rate debt and new issuances and the higher share count that I mentioned before, impacted per share metrics. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, the base business continues to deliver strong financial results. So let's look ahead to how the rest of the year is shaping up. With 2 gas utilities in the door, all the financing complete and a good line of sight to closing PSNC, we're pleased to be able to recast Enbridge's 2024 financial guidance. We're raising our 2024 EBITDA range to $17.7 billion to $18.3 billion. This increase reflects partial year contributions from each of the U.S. Gas Utilities and assumes we close PSNC mid-third quarter. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 6
Even with the partial years of EBITDA and all of the funding completed for these transactions, we're still maintaining our DCF guidance range of $5.40 to $5.80 per share. I'm also reaffirming our near-term financial outlook of 7% to 9% EBITDA growth through 2026, 4% to 6% EPS growth and approximately 3% DCF growth per share. All in all, it's shaping up to be another strong year with base business performing well and great execution on both the closings and the full financing of the U.S. Gas Utilities. Now let's turn to the balance sheet. In reaction to closing Questar and the progress on the acquisition funding plan, DBRS and S&P took positive actions on our credit ratings during the quarter. DBRS upgraded Enbridge to A(low) and S&P removed the negative outlook, affirming Enbridge's BBB+ stable outlook. Fitch also reaffirmed our BBB+ rating. While not unexpected, we're pleased to see that the agencies share a view that our long-held leverage target of 4.5 to 5x is a sweet spot for Enbridge. As we previously communicated, we expect leverage to peak after closing the PSNC acquisition and decrease throughout 2025 as we earn annualized EBITDA contributions from all the utilities. With that, let me move on to capital allocation. Our priorities remain unchanged, and we're laser-focused on the balance sheet. We canceled the remaining ATM this morning as we return to our equity self-funding model. We're well within our target debt-to-EBITDA range, despite only partial EBITDA contributions from our newly acquired U.S. LDCs. The dividend remains a staple of our investment offering, and we're committed to extending our 29-year track record of responsible dividend growth by continuing to grow the business in a very sustainable manner. Our $24 billion of secured capital backlog, which is underpinned by low-risk commercial terms, will be funded entirely through internally generated investment capacity. We plan to deploy approximately $6 billion to $7 billion per year in growth capital, leaving us another $2 billion that can be allocated towards the next available opportunities, whether that be sanctioning new strategic projects, accretive tuck-in M&A or debt reduction. With that, I'll pass it back to Greg to close off the call. Gregory Ebel Great financial overview, Pat. Thanks very much. Now let me conclude with why we think we're a first choice investment opportunity. We have a consistent track record of sustainably returning capital to shareholders, supported by a visible growth pipeline. This has resulted in an annual total shareholder return of greater than 10% over the past 20 years, and we see no change to that proposition going forward. We expect cash flow to grow 5% over the longer term. And when coupled with a growing dividend, investors are positioned to realize an annual TSR of 10% to 12% for the foreseeable future, supported by our low-risk business model, which includes 98% of our cash flows generated from either cost-of-service or take-or-pay contracts; a customer base that is over 95% investment; and 80% of the EBITDA earned from assets with protection against inflation; and our debt portfolio, which is less than 5% exposed to floating rate volatility. In short, we have diversified utility-like cash flows, a strong balance sheet and visible growth opportunities across each business unit franchise that will support and extend our 29 consecutive years of dividend increases. We remain committed to continuing the strong track record of returning capital to shareholders and believe it positions us as a first choice investment. Thank you again. And operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator, please open up the line for questions. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Robert Hope Maybe to start off with the TEPCO rate case. Can you walk us through kind of what the key drivers of the change there are, whether there were kind of some key roadblocks there and as well as kind of what you think it does mean in terms of an EBITDA or income uplift in '25 and '26? Cynthia Hansen Thanks, Rob, it's Cynthia. So the settlement, as you know, basically is a black box prepackaged settlement. So there's a whole bunch of items that came into consideration. So the team, our team at Enbridge looks what capital we've spent, what our operating costs are, forecasting that out into the future. We also look at what our rates are going to be impacted, have lots of that kind of conversation. So a lot of stuff goes into determining what those components are. And we don't specifically identify any one thing. But what it does allow us to do is to continue to earn that fair return into the future. And basically, as was noted, that's a 6% increase as of October of this year and then a further 2.75% in January of 2026. So with that rate all in, basically, we're in a position to continue to get a fair return. The next time we'll go back, we have a moratorium up until October of '27, but a comeback by Q3 of 2030. So we're just well positioned to continue to earn a strong return on those assets. Robert Hope All right. Appreciate that. And then maybe moving over to the 2024 recast EBITDA guidance range. Can you walk us through the puts and takes there? It does seem like H1 has outperformed expectations, especially on the Liquids side and layering in the Dominion assets gets us towards the upper end of the range. Just want to get a sense of whether or not you've adjusted the other businesses or just layered in Dominion. Or are there some specific headwinds we should be looking for in H2? Gregory Ebel Yes. Thanks, Rob, it's Greg. Yes, this is solely just based on layering in the utilities in the -- assuming that we get PSC here in the next couple of months and the related financing. As has been our practice, we don't change midyear, the other business units. But you pointed it out well. Obviously, the base businesses are all doing really great, utilization, volumes, et cetera. So a super strong quarter. So yes, obviously, if you were just looking at the base business, you'd be at that upper end. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1887321223&ts=3210990&ref=l6cin7 7/20

Robert Catellier Just going to follow up on the utilities here. What drove the decision to use the ATM versus asset sales? And understanding that you're fully funded for the acquisitions, what do you expect in terms of any asset sales going forward, given that you have that ongoing capital recycling program? Gregory Ebel Yes. Thanks for the question on that. Here's how we looked at it. Obviously, we had a super high level of confidence in terms of getting all the utilities closed, even a little faster than we had expected. So with that in mind and the fact that we saw the better economics than what was even in our deal model, we moved quickly, confidently to get all the financing done. So that's done. It may not fit everybody's model, but definitely exceeded the deal's economic assumptions that we had. With that behind us, the ATM terminated, it's really about now focusing on the business, get it at a great price and how do we keep moving this transaction forward and combine it with the rest of the assets. And as you would recognize and definitely didn't overlook, even with all that financing and the way in which we did it, we're going to be well within our guidance range. And as we just talked about, the base business would even look like it's better than that. So a great setup on that front. Asset sales, still very much part of what we look at. Let's not forget, we did a large asset sale earlier this year with Alliance and Aux Sable, but we're always looking at stuff. I wouldn't say there's anything near term that we have to do. And I think that's the key component here. Balance sheet in good position, financing done, businesses all running well. If we do anything significant on the asset sale side, it will be solely as a result of getting a great price on something. Robert Catellier Okay. And then just on the Mainline. Clearly, it's been a good quarter despite the onset of TMX. But I have a couple of questions about the near term and the long-term outlook. First, just in the term, I'm happy to hear your expectations of apportionment in August. But I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of risk of producer shut-ins in light of the forest fires. And then if you look longer term, the need for egress in post 2026, what level of political risk do you see there? In other words, do you think the producers are going to need that capacity respective of what government is in place in Canada? Or do you think they're probably waiting for the Canadian federal election to get better clarity on carbon prices moving forward? Colin Gruending Robert, yes, it's Colin. Thanks for the question on the Mainline. Yes, indeed, it's performing well. Business is good. We are apportioned in August. And I think Greg mentioned that we're very comfortable with the 3.0 million barrels per day full year guide. We're probably likely to exceed that, all things equal. But you did mention the risk of forest fires, I think that remains a present risk, maybe similar to last year. So to date, really negligible impact on Mainline volumes and basin production. There are active fires in the region. As you know, we're in close coordination with all our producers and have, I think, collective, everyone's enhanced 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

their investments in mitigation since 2016. But Mother Nature is there. So we'll watch that carefully through August, September here. But so far, we're looking pretty strong for the year, all things equal. That's the near term. So on the long term, I think on egress, Greg mentioned, we're teeing up some insurance egress at a minimum. It's likely will get used on the '26-'27 period. We're socializing that with industry. There's a significant interest at this time. I think if you look at each producer's book of supply optimization, debottlenecking and modest kind of modular growth, I think that's all -- also that's announced by each of them, and we track it, bottom up and top down, is likely to proceed kind of irrespective of any administration. It's all manageable and I think will fit within climate policies stated. There's potentially upside to that, I think, if things change, and we'll be on top of that. I mean I'm not really that concerned with egress bottlenecking here again, industry and collectively has a good beat on that and virtually there to serve as we've done in the last couple of decades. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO. Benjamin Pham Just on the data center comments and that slide you had with the map and the blobs there. Could you comment on which is a segment you expect to see the best risk reward or highest investment opportunity? And are you indifferent somewhat to where you're allocating capital towards that growing opportunity? Gregory Ebel Yes. Good question. I think they're all going to be, maybe not liquids as much, but it's got its own great opportunities. Probably the initial phase you see is GDS. And you saw we announced one today, and Michele and the team there signed up a 50-megawatt lateral into -- or a lateral for a 50-megawatt plant there. So I think that's probably the easiest move right away. But gas transmission has a lot of opportunities, too. As I mentioned during my opening comments, there's 600 million, 700 million cubic feet a day of request for capacity in the Southeast. Some of that will be coal-to-gas changing, but a lot of it is data center driven, things like storage. Obviously, that exists both in GTM and in GDS. And then let's not forget Matthew's business on the power side. And obviously, data centers, a lot of those folks are trying to meet just like a lot of other folks, their lower emission goals. And so they may like the gas for the reliability side. They'll help fund some of these projects with very long-term contracts, kind of like what you saw today. In terms of which ones get the capital, that's a classic risk-adjusted return base. It's obviously very, very safe capital that goes into the distribution business. If you've got long-term power purchase agreements on the renewable side, same thing. And obviously, there's a tax kicker there that we like. And then GTM, same thing. So they all have great returns on the equity portion, and then it's a classic discussion of how fast, how quick cycle the capital can be and the quality of the offtaker. So I think the key is, unlike anybody else, we have an opportunity to play in all elements of that. So when you look right across the entire system, Liquids demand is up, natty is up, electrons are up. If you look at the supply side, the same thing, Liquids are up, natty is up, electrons are up. And if you've got linear infrastructure and all those pieces, you win. So I think you'll increasingly see us 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

use that interconnectivity to give exactly what our customers want and something that's a differentiated offering from what anybody else has, all of which is a great setup for us to allocate capital to those best opportunities. Benjamin Pham All right. That's great context. And maybe a second question on the U.S. gas utility acquisitions, now you're closing or soon to be closed, all of them. Like what's the near-term focus or initiatives, those buckets? And can you comment on that 8% rate base growth visibility or expectation on how long that could persist? Gregory Ebel Sure. Michele is here, so I'll let her respond. Michele Harradence Sure. So of course, initially, we're really focused on integrating the utilities into gas distribution and storage. We stood up an organization to do that even before we announced the deal, and we've been very focused on it. We brought in Ohio now in March. We brought in Utah with that Idaho, Wyoming and of course, the Wexpro assets in June. And that comes with about 2,500 employees, that comes with almost 2.5 million customers, and it's gone very, very smoothly so far. And you'll recall that we have a lot of experience in doing this with the Union-Enbridge Gas merger that we did in Ontario. So feeling good about that. We've got about 30 months to work through our TSA with Dominion Energy, so lots of support for them. Of course, the first thing we've been doing is we've been bringing these utilities in, and being able to look under the hood a bit more is really testing and understanding those growth opportunities. And I've got to tell you, I still really love these utilities. I love the diversification of the growth that we get from these utilities. So Ontario -- and let's not forget about Ontario. Ontario is still going strong with its economic growth, about 40,000 customers a year that we're signing up there. Utah, Greg mentioned it in his overview, top-tier population growth, about 5% annually through '28. So they're attracting well over 20,000 customers a year. And then along with that rate base growth, Utah has a regulatory-approved rider programs that support things like rural expansion. And of course, we just talked about the data center growth that they're seeing along the Wasatch front. Similarly, Ohio, great growth that's driven primarily through the rider-eligible modernization program. Lots of work to do there to upgrade those systems. But again, that's going along really smoothly. And I'm quite confident we'll be just as pleased with North Carolina. So the growth projections we've given, we feel very, very good about for the next several years. Gregory Ebel Yes. I think at 8% CAGR on the rate base through '27 doesn't really take into account the data center, as I recall early days. So anything we get on that front will be additive. So -- and I like -- equally, so it's not just -- the rate base growth is different in each area, which I think underlines the ability. Depending on where you are in the cycle, it might be modernization, it might be growth, it might be data center, new builds, maybe changes from coal to gas, all of those pieces. And then I think the other thing we're really focused on as well is just that interconnectivity, where can we utilize gas transmission and/or power to help the utilities or vice versa? 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 11
Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet We've heard a lot about data centers south of the 49th parallel. I'm wondering if you see anything percolating north of the 49th parallel that you could capitalize on. Michele Harradence Yes, it's Michele here. So let me talk about Ontario a little bit. And for some of you who may have seen it, I've been told that the grandfather of AI is out of the University of Toronto. And more recently, I heard a statistic that there are over 250,000 jobs in Ontario tied to AI, in fact, more than in Silicon Valley. So without question, there's a lot of inbounds going on in Ontario right now about data center growth. I think the ISO is taking a good hard look at things. We know there's a certain amount of, let's call it, forum shopping that's going on, seeing where they can get that. But certainly in the GTA, in particular the Southwest GTA, lots of inquiries about data centers. And given that the time lines to build transmission and other support, they are absolutely going to be opportunities for behind-the-meter support that we can give on the gas distribution system. Gregory Ebel Kind of analogous in Ontario to how we've seen the greenhouse business change over the last 20 years, right? Good land, good location, great access to, obviously, gas infrastructure, nearness to the border, et cetera. So I wouldn't be surprised to see maybe not the same kind of explosive growth that we've been able to see on the greenhouse side, but definitely a good setup. Jeremy Tonet Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just looking at the Mainline and looking forward a bit more, just curious for any other color that you could share in particularly looking even later dated. I think in the release, you talked about conversations with regards to incremental egress opportunities. Just wondering if you could expand a bit more on what you see there. Gregory Ebel Yes, sure. Indeed, I think with the strength in supply growth and appetite to get to U.S. markets continually in the bid, pulling it that way. Industry is casting its eye to the future, like your question. And indeed, we are designing and socializing, as I mentioned, an expansion of the Mainline in that late '26-'27 period. It would be very capital efficient as our historic expansions have been. This would be in right away, very brownfield, more optimization than expansion, so to speak. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 12
But we would be looking to add circa 150,000 barrels a day. Let me say, I think it'd be quite executable and very economic for industry. So I think that's the next major tranche of egress expansion we have on deck there, but there's also continuing optimizations like we do every month and have for decades. So like I say, I think if you're looking at things like basis differentials and things, I'm not that concerned that they're going to blow out again. I think there's going to be solutions that are ready here in time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Manav Gupta And positive update on the data center side. Can you just go back and talk a little bit more about the JV that you announced last quarter with MPLX, WhiteWater and the benefits of that going ahead. Also, you guys have a track record of eventually becoming the operators of assets like Gray Oak. So would there be a desire to eventually operate this from the Enbridge side? Cynthia Hansen Thanks, Manav. It's Cynthia. Yes, it's -- we're very pleased with the investments that we made in WhiteWater. As you know, we have 19% of those assets. And of course, that includes the 100% of the Whistler pipeline that provides an incredibly important egress from the Permian as well as 50% of the Waha Gas Storage and then 70% of the ADCC Pipeline that just went into service on July 1. So we have, with the announcement of Blackcomb expansion, that's the kind of expansions that we were really excited about, and it's coming to fruition in a very short period of time. They're great assets. They're great operators. We're happy to be a part of that. We see future opportunities for growth, of course, now that we're just a minority interest in that. But we have, as part of that, our Rio Bravo Pipeline is now going to be operated and constructed through Whistler. So these are all great assets. We're happy to work with our partners on that. It allows us to fully participate in that Permian expansion, something that we've looked at for a long period of time. Now the future, I think, is very bright. We'll continue to have opportunities to participate there, and looking for future opportunities in that space. Gregory Ebel Yes. I think well said. We're good JV operators too. We've had a long history of working in JVs with great partners. Those are great partners. So I think the future with the structure that exists there today is going to deliver a ton of value, and it's been a great job with the team putting it together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1887321223&ts=3210990&ref=l6cin7 12/20

Page 13
If I can just start with your strategic priorities. And just what do you see as the top 2 or 3 over the next 12 to 24 months? But can you also specifically comment on whether there are any large projects that you haven't announced yet or other major asset bases or platforms that you feel are important to execute on your strategy that you need to action on that in that similar time frame? Gregory Ebel Well, here's the first three I'd give you, Robert. So the first one is, as always, and we're doing it, and you see we've made some adjustments this year is getting the most out of the base assets that we have. How do you get the return on the capital that you already have employed, improved? That's exactly how you get 1% or so of growth out of constantly doing that. And we've got a great track record and very focused on that. So that's number one. Number two, integrate the utilities that we've just bought both from an operational perspective, but also what other opportunities could exist there commercially, et cetera. Number three, we got $25 billion of projects, which maybe gets to your second question as well. $25 billion of projects that we're executing, $18 billion or so, which are in the power and gas side. That's a huge element because that's all about future growth. And doing that all within our ability to keep the balance sheet between 4.5 and 5x, that's the primacy out there right now. So those are what I'd say the top three things to focus on right now, and that's a handful. We're always looking for additional new projects. I think as Colin has just laid out, as Cynthia has laid out, and even if you look at both the renewable backlog as well as the utility businesses, those don't have massive projects. They've got real value-added projects at relatively low build. So you're doing things in JVs, whether it's WhiteWater, whether you're adding incremental egress that is actually low multiple builds or things like the Gray Oak stuff we're doing on the Gulf Coast, or quick-cycle capital that we're seeing at the utilities, $1.5 billion or so going to maybe $3 billion that you can turn quickly. That's better than actually focusing on a $10 billion project that may take 10 years to build. And then of course, Matthew's got the same thing. Got out and bought the TGE assets, and that actually accelerates the growth pattern for renewables and not having to wait for 6 or 7 years there. So I think it's a lot of singles and doubles that add up to a big home run for the corporation. Robert Kwan Got it. And if I can just finish to better understand or more color on your guidance. First, just on the Mainline, you mentioned 3 million barrels a day. You did 3.1 million the first half. So does that imply 2.9 million in the second quarter, and you can also say just what you are moving right now or what you moved in July? But just also as you get to DCF per share, can you just talk about any of the adjustments to your original guidance? Or can we just take the base business reconciliation in the report and effectively annualize the quarter to get to some of the DCF changes? Patrick Murray Yes. So Robert, it's Pat. I think on your volume question, I think Colin even mentioned that really confident with the 3 million barrels, probably even a little bit of upside there, given where we're at today. Remember, there is a bit of seasonality in the Mainline in that heat restrictions, sometimes costs come down a little lower in that kind of July, August, September time frame. So we'll see a little bit of that. That has nothing to 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

do with either the demand pull or supply push. It's just the way the pipeline operates. But feeling really good about that 3 million and even potential upward from there. I think the way to think about the new guidance is that -- or the recast guidance is that we really just layered on the utility. So the EBITDA, the partial years of EBITDA from each of them and then all of the financing that we did to kind of derisk the funding plan over the last 12 months. So from a DCF perspective, it really is just taking the extra shares and the hybrids and debt that we issued and layering that on to the base plan. It's kind of as simple as that. And I mean, I think it's a really good data point that we've mentioned. Greg mentioned we should be in that upper part of the EBITDA guidance, but that's what gives us a lot of confidence as well that will be in that kind of midpoint of our new DCF guidance range even with all the prefunding we did because we knew with partial year EBITDA that, that would bring that down a bit. So really pleased with the new guidance levels and the way the business is performing. Robert Kwan Okay. But just on your reconciliation, we can take the maintenance CapEx in the quarter for the most part and annualize it. It looks like there's absolutely no tax, incremental tax involved? Patrick Murray Yes. No meaningful cash tax from the transaction as we -- I think we mentioned originally. And from a -- maintenance capital will be a little bit more in the back half because, of course, we didn't add Utah until, what, beginning of June. So we only have 1 month in the quarter for that. And then, of course, we're going to add PSNC. It's the smallest of the 3 utilities. We've already got, call it, 80% of the cash flow in, but there'll be a little bit more uptick in the back half of the year just because we'll have basically all 3 for almost the full back 6 months. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley And congrats on a smooth process getting the gas LDCs done. Wanted to ask on the Ohio rate case that you're in right now. Just any impression of the staff rep that came out and then your level of confidence and visibility on reaching a settlement and constructive outcome there? Michele Harradence Sure. It's Michele here, Keith. So as you noted, the staff filed a report in July. It's really not unusual for the regulator staff responses to be different than what we would file in our initial rate applications. As you note, I think the PUC in Ohio definitely has a preference to settle, and we certainly think that we should be able to do that with them, and we're looking forward to working with them on that agreement. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

I would say that we expect a final determination that should -- it will take several months to negotiate it. It should be -- it's something that gives us an opportunity in a fair return. And we definitely expect it to land within the model that we set for the transaction itself. So we're quite confident that we're going to get there. Keith Stanley Great. And then in a prior question on strategic focus, I don't think you listed M&A as one piece of that strategic focus. Is that still on the back burner with the gas LDCs pretty much done now? Or do you think there will be opportunities over the near term that could make sense? Gregory Ebel Well, look, I mean, we always look at M&A. It's always -- given the size of the entity and how far and how many different businesses we're in, both on the buy- and the sell-side. But I didn't focus on it because I don't see anywhere, as you just stated, something like the utility acquisition. That size of transaction, obviously, kind of a once-in-a-decade-type opportunity. So yes, we'll look at that again, both on the buy and the sell. But I see that very much in the phrase that we use, the tuck-in size wouldn't be anywhere material like the utility side of things. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Theresa Chen Just to dig a little deeper on the Blackcomb discussion. So with the FID, can you remind us if there are any downstream synergies to tie into your existing Texas transmission or storage assets? And I understand you're a minority and a new partner or newer partner in this JV. Just looking at the future of the Permian, going back to some of Cynthia's comments, the visible gas growth and what seems to be a need for greenfield pipe maybe every 2 years. Can you share why you think Blackcomb was the winning project given many projects in competition? And with this commercial win, how the partnership is set up to grow in the outer years, given the visibility for additional gas and gross demand out of the basin? Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks, Theresa. As you mentioned, Blackcomb is one of the winners in that space. I think one of the reasons that the JV with Whistler is set up to be successful is that they have a really strong track record of delivering on-time, on-budget projects there. So I think that probably is something that -- that's one of the reasons we were attracted to entering into the JV. And I'm sure that, that was a contributing factor for why they were successful or we're successful with Blackcomb. As you look at the timing of it, it's something that because it's an intrastate pipeline, they're able to execute quickly. So the completion date for Blackcomb is in the second half of '26. That's fantastic. For commercial reasons, any specific questions need to be directed to WhiteWater as to what their future is. But from our point of view, they're very well positioned to continue to expand in the Permian. For the infrastructure, as it ties into us, of course, we have a very significant presence in that Agua Dulce area with our infrastructure there. And it's great just to see more and more investments and more volumes flow in. So I think that, that all bodes 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1887321223&ts=3210990&ref=l6cin7 15/20

Page 16
well for our overall infrastructure in that area. But it is, again, one of the reasons why we were so excited to execute on this transaction and be part of the joint venture. There is a very strong operating history for Whistler, and they are very well positioned in the Permian to continue to expand. Gregory Ebel Theresa, I'd only add that this is kind of a copy paste of the super system built on the Liquids side, right? We first entered into Ingleside and then a bunch of JVs and things like Gray Oak and Cactus II. And so all of the feedback into what customers want, an integrated system back to the Permian. And I think as Cynthia just went, whether it's the JV or additional assets, it's optionality. And that's what we're trying to build down there, that's what customers want. And I think that's a winning combination, which you're seeing play out. Theresa Chen And turning to the Liquids side, the contribution from other systems seemed pretty strong over the last 2 quarters, real step-up since last year. Is this a new normal range at this point? Are you still seeing strong utilization of Express-Platte, for example, even with narrowing WCS during the quarter? And how should we think about that line? Patrick Murray Yes, it's Pat here. Yes, I think you're seeing really good performance out of assets like Express-Platte out of the Bakken system. You also have the Southern Lights in there and the new accounting around some of that. But generally, they've all been operating kind of in line with our expectations, but a little bit better than the prior year. So we continue to see that being around the track record. You see, I think, in fact, I think the sum of the 2 quarters is almost exactly the same. So that's a pretty good run rate as we move forward here. Colin, I don't know if you have anything to comment on Express additionally. Colin Gruending Yes. I mean just business is good across all 3 basins we're in, Canada, the Bakken and the Permian. I think record set kind of on a quarterly basis here again. Oil is on. And I think you can count on this generally repeating. We're not giving guidance today for next year, but it's strong. Patrick Murray Yes. Volume up, demand up, infrastructure up. We already got it in the ground. So I think you can continue to see that happen. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1887321223&ts=3210990&ref=l6cin7 16/20

Page 17
So I guess first on data centers, with the emerging opportunities in the LDC segments -- in the LDC segment. Just two questions here. First, how are you assessing the CapEx profile for the LDCs? Does the increase in demand for data center connections, does that impact the $1.7 billion to $2 billion per year of LDC CapEx that you previously highlighted? And then second, how do you see support for data centers evolving from both regulatory agencies and also just public perception as it relates to rates and grid stability? Patrick Murray Yes. I think from a capital profile -- it's Pat, I can take that. I think it's a little early to say that it's going to be significantly more than that in the next year or 2 here, but we see some more opportunities. So there's probably upside to that number. I think the important part in my mind is that Greg and Michele both talked about the diversity of capital and the way it grows and the way that we can use riders to get the return on that as quickly as possible. I think this has one more diverse growth factor in many of the regions we're in. So I don't think we're at the point yet where we would adjust up that guidance that we are speaking of, but I think there's an upward bias for sure as a result of what's going on. And maybe Michele can speak about the cost and those discussions. Michele Harradence Yes, you bet. I mean it certainly is -- we would see it as upside. It's not something that we had in our model. And I think it's important to note too, Utah and North Carolina, Ohio, they do have expenses, the riders, but Utah and North Carolina going for rate cases every 2 to 3 years as well. So it's very quick-cycle capital as that comes. And if things start to shift, we'll be able to get that capital in there. And there is, particularly in Utah and North Carolina, a lot of demand for data centers. Ohio, we're a little on the edge where the demand center growth is, but we would see that demand backing up into our regions as well. And then with Ontario, of course, we have our ICM, our [ incentive ] capital module that we're in the middle of working through the Phase 2 rate case to work out right now. So all of them we would see as upside. In terms of the -- what the regulators are thinking about it, I do think that the regulators are trying to understand what, if any, policy decisions they need to make with regard to data centers. It is a different type of growth and demand on the system in a world where there's all sorts of demand for that reliable energy and a reliable electricity. So again, though, that's where our natural gas system really steps in to provide that support for that resilience and reliability and affordability that those data centers are looking for. Not to mention, as we've talked about on the renewables side as well. So we feel extremely well positioned with it. Gregory Ebel Yes. We may -- look, we often talk about being first choice for customers, but also for regulators and policymakers. I mean one of the ways to deal with if there are concerns about that from a rate perspective is you do it through GTM. And you build a lateral there and storage, which is. more on a contractual basis, as you know, doesn't hit others. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1887321223&ts=3210990&ref=l6cin7 17/20

Page 18
So I think the key here is you want to have lots of tools and we have them, and you want to be in a lot of jurisdictions. I know a lot of discussion about Virginia being a great place for data centers. That's true. It's also a highly dense population area, where Utah, parts of North Carolina, may not be the same and are also hugely known. Utah is the Silicon Slope and obviously, the technology triangle and North Carolina, too. So there are more places to be able to build. And if you're in those locations, you've got the opportunity. So I think it's -- let's call it, often called, the liquid system a bit of a tool and a, what do you call it, kind of knife? Colin Gruending Swiss Army knife. Gregory Ebel Swiss Army knife, there we go. So that's -- I think that's the same thing right across the entire system. So yes, it came on for us. Praneeth Satish Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And just quickly on Mainline. With it being apportioned every month this year, can you help quantify how much headroom is remaining within the ROE collar? I know you said you're earning in the upper half, but I guess I'm just curious how close you are to the ceiling and whether you're on pace to hit the ceiling if current market conditions persist. Colin Gruending Yes. Thanks. So I think we are just above the midpoint of that in 2024. I think 2025, we're probably a little higher yet. And in '26, we're probably approaching the top. So it's all working kind of as intended. It's a win for everyone here. We're moving a lot of volumes, keeping attractive economics for all our customers. Operator Your final question comes from the line of Patrick Kenny from National Bank Financial. Patrick Kenny Just a follow-up on the discussion around further asset sales outside of receiving an attractive financial. Just wondering if more so from a strategic standpoint, if you're still actively pursuing additional minority sell-down opportunities with indigenous groups. And if so, which regions or franchises might you be keen to execute partnerships for, similar to your deal that you did on your oil sands pipelines? Gregory Ebel Yes, for sure. Look, I think we've -- one of the trailblazers on that front. You just saw this quarter, we announced not a sell-down, but a go-forward project in Saskatchewan that's very much a collaboration between the 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 19
renewables group and the Liquids group. We've always talked about are there other opportunities on the Liquids side. I know Cynthia and her team are looking at that as well on the gas side. So I think right across the board, yes. That's different than saying selling an asset to raise funds. We don't need to do that. This is really when you do those, it's about relationships, about doing the right thing. It's about future opportunities, and there's a lot of stakeholders to deal with. And we believe that if you do these transactions wisely with respect in the heart of reconciliation, that's going to help you in the community overall, that's going to help you deliver on those projects, and all that is value adding to Enbridge's proposition. I don't know, team, if there's anybody else who wants to -- Cynthia? Cynthia Hansen Well, yes, we've said this before, with all the work that we're doing in British Columbia, it's obviously an area that we're looking at. We have recently filed with the CER, an opportunity to allow us to do that in British Columbia with our Westcoast system. So it's something that we're always actively looking at to make sure that we can support our -- the indigenous economic reconciliation. Gregory Ebel Pat, just if you're keeping track, we've got, I think, 4 announced co-investment partnerships now, right, Thailand, Ontario, Northern Alberta on a liquids system, the carbon hub near Edmonton and the Weyburn. So that's -- lost track, but there's 3 or 4 different asset classes there. And just you're probably looking at it from a financial lens. But if you haven't checked it out, we've got a published Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan on our website. Economic participation is a major tenet of that plan. Patrick Kenny Okay. That's perfect. And then maybe on Ingleside and the record exports there in the quarter. Just wondering if you could provide any additional color on the contracting profile of the facility. And perhaps an update on how your volumes might be protected from competing export terminals potentially coming online along the Gulf Coast as well as how we should be thinking about further upside and throughput based on some of your near- term initiatives underway. Colin Gruending Yes. I'll try to abbreviate the answer. There's a lot in there. Listen, I think we feel really good about our position there. It's the #1 market share terminal in the U.S. and it has its advantage, as we've talked about in many respects. So customers want to come there. We've been quite busy there recently. The trends are encouraging. There's another 1 million barrels a day of Permian volume coming. I think we'll capture our share of that given that advantage. Math, here's a stat for you. The facilities to date has moved 3 billion barrels of oil off the dock. It's a major and central part of the plumbing in the Permian. I think it's going to ensure where we have life left on our contracts here. And as we look at, I guess, competitive situations there, and I'm not sure which competitors you're referring to, but potentially, you're thinking about offshore buoys that are conceptually out there. I think 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1887321223&ts=3210990&ref=l6cin7 19/20

Page 20
we're going to compete fine with them. I think if they do come into play, I think the smaller, older, less advantaged terminals will -- may lose some market share there. So we think we're in pretty good shape here. We're going to grow this. It is the Swiss Army knife, and we're also going to bring other commodities to this facility for the same advantages it has [ incurred ]. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Morley for closing remarks. Rebecca Morley Great. Thank you, and we appreciate your ongoing interest in Enbridge.

communities impacted and wish to reiterate Enbridge's commitment to support during this challenging time. While we've seen limited interruption of our operations and no material financial impact, safety remains our #1 priority in ensuring communities have safe and reliable energy necessary for everyday activities. Now on to the quarter. I'm going to start by sharing some highlights for Q3, then I'd like to spend a minute or so highlighting Enbridge's value proposition and how we are positioned to return capital to shareholders in all market cycles. I'll then review how Enbridge is ideally situated to serve increasing gas demand stemming from data centers, electric power, LNG, coal retirement and industrial growth. I'll also provide updates from our business units before turning it over to Pat. Pat will walk you through our third quarter results, key drivers supporting our reaffirmed financial outlook and our capital allocation priorities. I will then close with a few key messages and highlight some important events coming up in the calendar. Following our presentation, the Enbridge management team will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. Throughout the third quarter, our assets again experienced continued strong utilization across the business, which drove solid financial results. We are well positioned to deliver full year results near the top end of our EBITDA guidance. On DCF per share, we continue to expect to be near the midpoint of the range despite fully prefunding the utilities acquisition before they're closing. Our leverage is within our target range of 4.5 to 5x debt-to-EBITDA after closing PSNC, and we expect to trend down over the next few quarters. With the acquisitions closed and the funding completed, we have successfully concluded the acquisition of 3 U.S. gas utilities, which perfectly fit Enbridge's low-risk business model. And so we have returned to an equity self-funded model. This has been a well-executed major transaction that investors will benefit from for years to come. In Liquids, we closed the previously announced acquisition of additional docks and land adjacent to our state-of- the-art crude export facility at Ingleside. We continue to see high utilization and expect to unlock future growth opportunities there. Across the businesses, we're on track to place $5 billion of secured capital into service in 2024. On growth, the team has done a great job, and I'm pleased to highlight 4 new accretive investments in growth. In Gas Transmission, we further executed our Permian strategy by acquiring a 15% interest in the highly contracted DBR gathering system. The assets enhance our natural gas value chain and serve as a key feeder system for the Whistler pipeline. In Renewable Power, we sanctioned Sequoia Solar, an up to 815-megawatt project in Texas. Sequoia is backed by long-term PPAs with AT&T and Toyota for the vast majority of production. We're also excited to announce participation in the third and final phase of Fox Squirrel Solar following a successful completion of the second phase during the quarter. In Gas Transmission, we also sanctioned offshore oil and gas pipelines to serve BP's new deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico development. All in all, we've added $7 billion to our secured growth program so far this year. As you can see, our scale and connectivity continue to provide competitive advantages in sanctioning new opportunities. This growth in our business continues to underpin our stable and growing dividend. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

At Enbridge, we have built a low-risk business that is designed to succeed in all market cycles. This is how we've been able to deliver growing dividends for 29 years, making us one of the very few dividend aristocrats. Looking longer term, we expect to steadily grow the business by 5% annually and will remain financially disciplined to support sustainably returning capital to shareholders. Enbridge offers an attractive dividend yield, which sits above the return of many alternative investments. The Canadian and U.S. 10-year treasuries are sitting at about 3% and 4%, respectively, while broad equity indices, like the TSX 60 and the S&P 500 are at approximately 3% and 1%, respectively. It's worth noting key drivers that enable us to be considered a dividend aristocrat and underpin that 29 years of dividend growth. Our highly contracted cash flows experienced minimal volatility, allowing us to predictably pay and grow the dividend. Investment-grade credit ratings across the 4 major rating agencies highlight the strength of our balance sheet and the low-risk nature of our businesses. We have negligible commodity price exposure, which sets us apart from many of our midstream peers. And then on EBITDA growth, we expect that to be higher through the next few years at 7% to 9% due to base business performance, new assets entering service, tuck-in M&A and contributions from the acquired utilities. Enbridge outpaces Canadian large peers by making up approximately 10% of the total dividends paid by the TSX 60 companies today. All told, our business is designed to succeed in all market cycles and deliver predictable results. Despite a volatile world, Enbridge is seeing increased visibility of our long-term growth, supported by strong energy infrastructure fundamentals, and in particular, rising power demand. Enbridge is well positioned to serve increased gas and power demand over the next decade. S&P is forecasting up to 20 Bcf per day of incremental gas demand growth by 2030. We are ideally situated to participate in new growth opportunities related to this increased demand. Our gas footprint is within 50 miles of approximately 45% of all gas-fired generation in North America today. Importantly, for investors today, we are already sanctioning additional growth opportunities to support natural gas power demand. Like our Tennessee Ridgeline project, where we're investing USD 1.1 billion to expand our East Tennessee pipeline to support TVA's planned retirement of 9 coal-fired units in favor of 1.5 gigawatts of gas- fired generation. Our utilities are situated in high-growth power markets with North Carolina being a top destination for onshoring due to its affordable power and favorable corporate tax rates. In that regard, Enbridge Gas, North Carolina is investing USD 600 million to expand our gas lines to serve Duke's Roxboro gas-fired generation plant, which will have capacity of at least 1.4 gigawatts. We expect that project to be completed in 2027. We also have exciting developments within our Renewables segment with over 2 gigawatts in development or under construction across the U.S. Beyond the electric power sector, we own over 620 Bcf of strategically located natural gas storage, and this position is growing. Our portfolio represents 25% of the U.S. Gulf Coast deliverability, and we own the only underground natural gas storage facility in British Columbia, which will provide essential flexibility for Canadian LNG operations. Of course, our Great Lakes storage position of 300 Bcf at Dawn is a critical hub for North American natural gas users like power generators and utilities and continues to expand each year. Dawn represents over 20% of deliverability in the region. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

On the LNG front, our pipelines are strategically connected to more than 30% of existing and announced LNG export capacity and will continue to serve global demand growth. We also have a preferred interest in Woodfibre LNG, which is expected to be the world's first net zero export facility through utilizing hydropower and is expected to produce 2.1 million tonnes per annum. Now let's jump into the exciting updates on each of the business units, starting with Liquids. Mainline is on track to exceed our full year forecast of 3 million barrels per day. The system was an apportionment in July and August, and we continue to see strong customer demand, evidenced by the fact that the Mainline is back in apportionment for November. We're advancing discussions with customers for additional Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin pipeline capacity in 2026 and beyond. You should think of these as brownfield opportunities that will be very capital efficient and provide customers with critical insurance egress to deliver barrels to downstream markets. As producers grow into available egress out of Western Canada, we've also recently started advancing a number of capital-efficient, low multiple expansion opportunities on our regional oil sands pipes. In the Permian, we continue to see strong volumes this quarter. At Ingleside, we set a single-day volume record of 2.6 million barrels and a monthly average record of 1.2 million barrels per day. It's noteworthy, Ingleside recently hit 3 billion, with a B, barrels of volumes exported, underscoring the competitive advantage of the facility and strong customer demand that attracted us to purchase of the facility in 2021. We are seeing continued growth there with 2.5 million barrels of storage under construction with in-service expected in 2025. We also closed the acquisition of new docks and adjacent lands at Ingleside, which will provide further growth opportunities and allow us to optimize existing dock capacity. Work is already underway to integrate these new assets. And now let's look a little bit deeper at our gas transmission business. I'm excited to highlight how we are connecting new supply to key demand centers and extending our Permian natural gas value chain. We sanctioned close to $1 billion in offshore pipelines during the quarter to serve BP's new deepwater development plans in the Gulf. These pipelines strengthen and diversify our offshore business while expanding our footprint in the region, backed by long-term contracts with in-service expected in 2029, adding secured capital to our backlog at the end of the decade. We acquired a 15% interest in DBR system. It extends our natural gas value chain and further demonstrates strategic value and growth opportunity being unlocked through the Whistler JV we announced earlier this year. As a reminder, we also previously announced sanctioning the Blackcomb pipeline, which will add up to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day of egress for our Permian customers and serve growing natural gas demand in the area in 2026. We are progressing in our development of 6.5 Bcf expansion in our Tres Palacios gas storage facility which we acquired in early 2023 at an attractive price. Demand for recontracting continues to increase. And since acquisition, rates have about doubled for the strategically located asset, providing accretion beyond our original model expectations. The Venice Extension project, which serves Venture Global's Plaquemines LNG export facility is now flowing gas, and we expect it to be fully in service by year-end. So now let's move on to our Gas Distribution segment. As I mentioned earlier, we have now welcomed all 3 U.S. gas utilities into Enbridge, and I couldn't be more proud of the team's dedication and commitment to execution. We are now the largest natural gas utility in North America, delivering over 9 billion cubic feet per day and serving 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

approximately 7 million customers. The team has been hard at work integrating each of the utilities, and we expect that to continue in the months ahead. With our 4 utilities now in-house, I thought I'd spend a minute highlighting the key growth drivers across the franchise. In Ontario, we expect new customer hookups and additional power generation to drive growth, including new investment in storage and transmission. The utility has a strong track record of predictable growth and consistent returns. The Ontario government just released their long-term vision for the province's energy industry and future in response to the ISO's updated demand forecast, which predicts a 75% increase in electricity demand by 2050. We are pleased to see the Minister of Energy acknowledging the vital role natural gas plays in Ontario's first integrated energy resource plan to ensure customer affordability and reliability across industrial, residential, commercial and agricultural sectors. In combination with the ISO's forecast, we believe that Enbridge Gas Ontario is primed to benefit from major tailwinds of gas demand. The province is procuring up to 1,300 megawatts of new gas-fired generation and have reported that there are over 7,000 megawatts of data center interconnection inquiries across more than 30 unique sites. In Ohio, growth will largely be driven by pipeline replacement, modernization and system enhancement under program such as the pipeline infrastructure replacement plan. Over 80% of capital spend in Ohio is expected to be quick cycle under these rider programs and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. That said, we are also evaluating opportunities to serve new demand related to data centers and natural gas power plant expansion. Growth in Enbridge Gas Utah will be driven by increased population and data center power demand and modernization of the system. We're excited about the data center opportunities we're seeing there so far. We've recently contracted supply to serve 200 megawatts of power for data centers and are evaluating inquiries for another 600 megawatts. Finally, Enbridge Gas in North Carolina has a very healthy population growth, and we'll be expanding to serve Duke's 1.4 gigawatt Roxboro gas-fired generation plant, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, and constructing a 2 Bcf LNG facility for system reliability. North Carolina is also opportunity-rich as the state is positioned to be one of the primary beneficiaries of industrial growth from onshoring of manufacturing in the region. Overall, we see an average of 8% annual rate base growth across our U.S. gas utilities over the coming years. Now let's turn to the renewables business. Our strategic and disciplined approach has resulted in sanctioning additional growth with blue-chip partners. We're excited to announce that we've completed Phase 2 of Fox Squirrel Solar project. Phase 3 is under construction and is expected to be in service by year-end. Consistent with the other phases, Phase 3 is backed by a long-term PPA with Amazon for 100% of the energy production. We also sanctioned the approximately 800-megawatt Sequoia solar project in Texas with a staggered in-service date expected in '25 and '26. This will be one of the largest solar facilities in North America by capacity and is backed by long-term PPAs with AT&T and Toyota for substantially all of the production. This marks further execution on the opportunities laid out at Investor Day as we developed 2 gigawatts of renewable projects in- service dates by the end of 2026. Our customer relationships and disciplined track record of development and contracting should allow us to continue delivering solid growth in this segment with strong risk-adjusted returns. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

With this, I'll turn it over to Pat to discuss our third quarter financial results. Patrick Murray Thanks, Greg, and welcome, everyone. Continued strong demand across our asset base drove record third quarter EBITDA and we earned DCF per share of $1.19, which includes the impact of prefunding of the U.S. gas utilities. Liquids EBITDA is up year-over-year, primarily due to the first of our annual OpEx inflation and power cost escalators, which increased the mainline toll. As a reminder, they take effect on July 1 of each year. Our gas transmission business is up compared to last year despite the sale of our interest in Alliance & Aux Sable. This is driven by the acquisition of Tomorrow RNG, the 19% interest in the Whistler joint venture and our gas storage assets outperforming. We continue to see solid demand for our gas storage and benefit from elevated rates in the contracts we entered into since last year. I'm also happy to announce that we once again have recontracted 100% of our GTM Evergreen contracts illustrating the high demand for these great assets. Our gas distribution business includes a full quarter of EBITDA from both Enbridge Gas Ohio and Enbridge Gas Utah, which drove the majority of the step-up in 2023. Our renewables business earned development fees in the third quarter of 2023, which can be lumpy, and their absence this quarter is driving the decrease year-over-year. Below the line, we have higher maintenance capital from the U.S. gas utility acquisitions as well as higher interest expense and weighted average shares from the associated prefunding of those same U.S. gas utilities. All in all, our third quarter results have set us up to achieve our guidance range for the 19th consecutive year. Let's dive a little deeper into that guidance. As a reminder, we recast our financial guidance in the second quarter to include the U.S. gas utilities, and I'm pleased to reaffirm those ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and DCF per share. In fact, we expect to close 2024 with another quarter of strong operating performance, which would push Enbridge near the top of our EBITDA guidance range. For DCF per share, we expect to finish the year around the midpoint of guidance, which is a great outcome when you consider the prefunding of the utility acquisition we did this year while not benefiting from a full year of EBITDA. Looking ahead, full year utility contribution, coupled with continued operational excellence and in-footprint initiatives should drive growth over the near and medium term. Our balanced and diversified secured backlog sits at $27 billion today, and we expect to place approximately $5 billion of that into service by the end of 2024. Both projects are expected to drive new EBITDA and underpin our near-term growth commitments through 2026. Now let's turn to our capital allocation priorities. Our capital allocation philosophy is guided by our financial guardrails, which remain firmly in place. Our target leverage of 4.5 to 5x is a sweet spot for Enbridge and the DCF payout of 60% to 70% aligns with our cash flow-oriented view of the business. We're proud of our dividend aristocrat status become a hallmark of our value proposition and growing our dividend annually is a key consideration when deploying our $8 billion to $9 billion of annual growth investment capacity. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

For the next few years, we've earmarked approximately $6 billion to $7 billion in the form of low capital intensity expansion, modernization capital and rate base investment. The remaining $2 billion to $3 billion of investment capacity can be opportunistically deployed either into new accretive organic projects, tuck-ins or debt reduction. Within that framework, we capitalize on the best available opportunities with our equity self-funding model. Our outlook and growth will continue to revolve around low-risk, long-life investments that support ratable dividend increases. I want to again thank the teams for their hard work this quarter, bringing the last of the LDCs and ensuring another great operational and financial showing here at Enbridge. With that, I'll pass it back to Greg to finish off the presentation. Gregory Ebel Thanks very much, Pat. Enbridge continues to be positioned to succeed in all market conditions with a low-risk business model and visible growth outlook. The scale and diversification of our business is driving key competitive advantages across complementary business franchises. Our businesses are already in front of and will continue to be in front of dramatic secular changes in power demand, both gas and renewables, reindustrialization in the key jurisdictions we serve in North America and, of course, growing energy exports from North America. Our industry-leading asset footprint and a solid track record of execution has allowed us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities to meet rising global demand for energy. Returning capital to shareholders through a sustainable and growing dividend continues to be a core pillar of our value proposition and positions us as the first choice investment opportunity. Now before I turn it over to the operator for questions, I'd like to share the dates of some exciting events coming up on the calendar. We expect to issue a news release with our 2025 financial guidance on December 3, 2024. And then on March 4, 2025, we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day in New York, and we hope that you can all join us is in person. With that, I'd like to thank you all for listening. And operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet Just wanted to start off, I guess, looking down the future, you outlined some of the expansion potential for the Mainline, but it seems like we've filled up pretty quick here. Just wondering, I guess, what's possible on the egress front down the road as it seems like producers are eager to fill any space you can provide? 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1899670452&ts=3296847&ref=l6cin7 7/18

Colin Gruending Jeremy, it's Colin. Yes, I think your read is right on this. Production is ramping nicely. And yes, we're back into apportionment here in November. I don't expect us to be in the apportionment every month going forward here. But seasonally, I think you're going to see a lot of demand for the Mainline. And we have commenced commercial discussions with industry. We spent the quarter engineering the expansion. It's really more of an optimization, I think. It's not a trenching or a new path. It's in the right of way in terminals and quite executable. So I'd say early response from industry is quite positive for obvious reasons, as Greg said in his remarks. And I think as everybody knows, the last barrel -- egress prices all 5 million barrels in the basin. So it's very economically important that basin is not constrained. So we're continuing to develop that. I'd say it's trending in the right direction. And I don't think we have any capital cost estimates for you at this point, kind of refine those a little bit, but looking at in-service dates in late '26, '27. Gregory Ebel The other nice thing I'd add to that, Jeremy, is that they'll be very solid from a build multiple perspective, which obviously means the returns will be very satisfactory for both us and investors. Jeremy Tonet That's great to hear. And then pivoting to the LDC side. Now that Enbridge is the largest natural gas LDC in North America that we can tell. Just wondering, how you think about future growth here. Obviously, a lot of organic initiatives that can be had on your existing platform, but we also see some other LDC assets on the block out there for sale. How do you think about organic versus inorganic growth going forward? Gregory Ebel Just to start, Jeremy, thanks for the question. Michele is here, so I'll let her go at that. In terms of other LDCs, look, we've made some big purchases here with 3 of what we think are the best ones out there. So I would say our focus is very much on integration of these 3, not looking at other LDCs at this point in time. But in terms of the growth, may I'll turn it over to Michele. Michele Harradence Yes, you bet. Jeremy. So first, I think what I have to say now being able to really look under the hood of these beyond what we did through the due diligence period is, these are every bit as good as we thought they were in terms of the utilities. They're just excellent utilities in great jurisdictions that really are focused on the access to affordable energy driving their economic growth. And that means that they're really well positioned for growth. Certainly, Greg outlined the different ways that we see them growing. In terms of population growth, super strong in places like Utah and North Carolina, strong modernization program with quick capital in Ohio. I think we also talked about our projects that we have going on in North Carolina. I'd say all of those we knew as we went in. The big thing that's come up in the last year that really didn't factor in is the data center growth that we're seeing, and that's coming across the board. I mean, we -- I think last quarter, we mentioned 50 megawatts we had signed up in Utah. That's -- or at least the gas to produce that 50 megawatts and that's been increased to about another 200 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1899670452&ts=3296847&ref=l6cin7 8/18

Page 9
megawatts in terms of the gas to produce that and lots of inquiries along that, they call it the Wasatch front. So that Salt Lake-Provo area. Similarly, North Carolina, a big decarbonization program from Duke, lots of data centers going into that Raleigh tech hub. And even in Ohio, where we thought it was a little further out, we're just seeing that demand for power. And then, of course, in our original utility in Ontario, as Greg mentioned, 75% growth by 2050, government and a Minister of Energy that's very clear about the need for all of the above when it comes to energy and the need for natural gas as meeting part of the generation that they're looking for from what's been the largest ever procurement in the Ontario ISO's history. So we're feeling very good about that growth. Gregory Ebel Yes. So Jeremy, the only other thing I'd add is that at 8% rate base growth we talked about a year ago, remember, that did not take into account. We didn't have knowledge or good insight into some of the benefits we're seeing from data centers, power growth, reindustrialization, reshoring. So obviously, I'll be looking for Michele and the team to even do better than what we originally thought. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC. Robert Catellier I'd like to start with the rate of capital deployment into onshore renewables, particularly in the U.S. You've accomplished a lot in a short period of time, but I'm wondering how much capital is needed to be deployed to meaningfully bridge the gap between EBITDA and the DCF per share growth rate, understanding that these investments stand on their own merits and not just for the tax attributes. Matthew Akman Yes. Rob. It's Matthew. We're really, really pleased with our progress, as you noted, on the onshore, and I think our pivot there is really paying off. We've got a lot of great projects. And as I said at Investor Day, especially in solar, there's this rich theme here where panel prices went down quite a lot. And so companies like ours that had interconnection agreements, ready-to-go projects are capitalizing on the very high demand out there, not only from data centers, but all kinds of blue-chip corporates. As you see here, we got AT&T and Toyota and the Sequoia project. And there's lots of great data center conversations going on, as you can imagine. So we're really able to capitalize on that and achieve returns, frankly, above what we even expected on these. We're talking like mid-teens type returns, very solidly accretive, right out of the chute, quick-cycle capital on these. We're going to be bringing these in-service starting in next year. So we're not tying up a lot of capital for a long period. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 10
So look, this is really beneficial across the board. And we got a good pipeline behind us. We've probably got another couple of gigawatts here anyway that we can roll out into the strong demand and strong return environment. Gregory Ebel Robert, I wouldn't -- it's Greg. I wouldn't downplay the tax benefits, too, right? I mean, that does get to your per- share metrics. So everything that Matthew said is bang on, but we look at it both from an EBITDA perspective, but obviously, the bottom line impact as well, right? Robert Catellier That's what I was getting at. It seems like there's an opportunity to bridge the gap between your lower DCF per share outlook and what you have on the EBITDA on the EPS front. But second question I had is maybe for Colin, we've been hearing, reading media reports about potential additional asset sales to indigenous groups. And I wondered if there was any update you had for us there. Colin Gruending Yes. Robert. So as you know, Enbridge is committed to reconciliation and has had some success partnering with communities already. I think we have 3 partnerships, working on some other ones. We're early innings on the one that the media picked up. So I'd ask you to be patient with us. We're going to work through it. But you can probably imagine the types of relationships and communities we're dealing with. And there's a capital recycling element to it as well, right? So we're excited about it. We'll keep working it, but please be patient with us. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO. Benjamin Pham Maybe just to go back to the comment on the solar returns being in the mid-teens. Can you clarify that a bit because we're hearing from industry on renewables side that returns in solar have been quite challenging within the renewable technologies. I know you referenced panel prices, but is that more exclusive to Enbridge there? Matthew Akman Well, I think -- Ben, it's Matthew again. I think it really depends how you're positioned. And it's a couple of things. One is having the interconnection agreements. The other is being able to navigate the supply chain. And companies like ours that are large and the supply chain wants to do business with us and we get very solid terms and conditions there. And the buyers, too, these are the kinds of buyers, this is Enbridge type customers. These large data center type customers and blue-chip corporates, they're going to want to do business with us. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1899670452&ts=3296847&ref=l6cin7 10/18

Page 11
And so we think we got industry best-in-class terms and conditions. And we also know how to build and operate stuff efficiently. So all that combined, Ben, I'm not sure what you're hearing, but you'll see these are going to be right out of the chute, very cash flow accretive and kick out great returns over the life of the project. So yes, I think that mid-teens return level is solidly in sight here. Benjamin Pham Okay. That's good to hear. And maybe on the regional pipeline expansion commentary, are you thinking that's more lateral connections into [indiscernible] asset basket? Are you thinking more of those 2 pipes could get potentially expanded? Colin Gruending Yes, Ben, Colin here. So generally, I'd say the basin is overpiped. I think there's a lot of competitors up there. But there are a number of bottlenecks in the system. We have 7 pipelines in the region, right? You'll recall them. And these would be, again, horsepower, DRA, lateral, some long-haul pipes in scope there, too. But debottlenecking, a very capital-efficient returns here in short cycle. So the production growth we talked about earlier is showing up on the mainline and downstream, but also at home locally. So it's fairly imminent here. We're looking at this in the next few quarters. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets. Maurice Choy Just want to stick with the Mainline theme here. Greg and Colin, you both mentioned that November is a portion, but may not be a portion every month from here on in. Maybe if you look at things on an annual basis, can you talk to any factors that would cause you to think this year's volume level wouldn't improve in 2025 and beyond, whether that be expectations like commodity prices or production shut-ins, just keen to hear your thoughts on that. Colin Gruending Sure, Maurice. Yes. So last, let's call it, 2023's annual volume throughput through the Mainline was basically full. I think it was [indiscernible], all-time record. This year, we're trending to over 3 million, probably not [ 380 ], but over 3 million. And next year, I think you should think about a comparable number. We think we'll have more definition for you in a few weeks, but lots of factors. But each year, there's turnarounds embedded in that. There's outages embedded in that. There's supply growth. There's demand growth. I think the competitor pipelines are performing well, but generally at a run rate level. We continue to find and optimize our own capacity. Our outage management has gotten a lot better. We have optimizations that we're doing monthly and quarterly to add a little bit of capacity. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1899670452&ts=3296847&ref=l6cin7 11/18

Page 12
So we remain pretty bullish on the utilization. Like the numbers we're talking about are 98%, 99% full. So there's some variation around that. I don't want to give anybody the impression that it's locked, but there's a multiplicity of supply sources. We're connected to 40 different refineries. So there's a diversity that stabilizes it generally. Gregory Ebel I love the question, Maurice, because it's only a couple of years ago where people worried, oh, how are you going to hit 3 million. And there we are continuing to do that. And as you hear from Colin, yes, it's 3 million, and then let's look at other opportunities down the road. So it's a good question, right, because I think a lot of people were dead wrong on this issue. And I think we've proven that outcome different cycles, but also even the arrival of TMX. Maurice Choy TMX ramp-up definitely has been much better than anyone anticipated, to be honest. So that's good. Maybe finishing up on a question on the secured growth plan. From the prepared remarks and even from Michele's comments, there seems to be quite a bit of growth in the U.S. and possibly even in Ontario through the integrated energy resource planning. And we obviously heard from Matthew's mid-teens return commentary just now on renewables. So Greg, as you look across your various businesses you have today, can you speak to the trends -- maybe since Enbridge Day, can you speak to trends in terms of where you see the greatest opportunity set? And separately, where the risk-adjusted returns that are most attractive? Gregory Ebel Yes, sure. I mean, look, you're absolutely right. I think the arrival of the U.S. utilities into the portfolio put a new opportunity set. And then as Michele said, you throw on the data center elements of that, and really, it's the electric elements of that. These things need to be powered. I think that allows incremental opportunities on the renewables side. Very careful, certain jurisdictions, quick cycle just like GDS. So I see that opportunity there. And then let's not forget GTM. GTM is filling up on the power side, the storage side, all the LNG facilities. So as I said in my comments, there really are cyclical trends that we are in front of right now, whether it's on the power side, whether it's on the reindustrialization side and nearshoring or whether it's on the export side, which you heard the numbers and the record numbers on Ingleside, and you're going to see things kick up on the LNG side as well. So I would say, to your base question, we have an opportunity-rich environment and everybody has got to compete for that. Even amongst the utilities, we will invest our capital in the best returning utilities. If that's Ontario, it's Ontario. If it's Ohio, it's Ohio or Utah. And the same thing on the gas side. Is it going to be B.C.? Or is it going to be the Gulf Coast or the Northeast? And so I think we've got the capacity, as Pat has laid out in the past, that $8 billion or $9 billion of capacity each year, and I expect we'll use it. And so it comes down to risk-adjusted returns. How quick can you take that capital, turn it into earnings for shareholders, which allows us to continue to drive the dividend forward. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 13
So if anything, I would just say the markets since Investor Day, and we look forward to coming back to you all in March, has got even better, both externally for our growth, but internally for competition for capital. I like that dynamic for growth. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Manav Gupta Congrats on a strong quarter. In early October, you announced a project which adds to your growing pipeline in Gulf of Mexico to support BP operations. Can we get some more details about this project and why it's a good return on investment? Cynthia Hansen Yes. Manav, it's Cynthia Hansen here. We're really excited about the Canyons pipeline supporting the BP Kaskida. So as was noted, it's about $700 million of investment and that will be in service in 2029. What we really like is that it ties into our existing infrastructure that we have there. You may know this or may not, that we actually transport 40% of all the natural gas that comes in the Gulf Coast. And this particular field, we have a lot of experience and expertise in this area, supporting this infrastructure. It's going to tie in the gas pipeline, that 12-inch is going to tie into our existing field, Magnolia gas platform. And then the other oil pipeline ties into the Shell infrastructure. And of course, last year, we had announced our project there to support the ongoing development for Sparta. So it really does tie in, and we're getting the long-term return with really strong contracts. So the contracts allow us to get that return on our investment in that first 10-year period. So it's really exciting for us to continue to support that build out in the Gulf of Mexico. Gregory Ebel Well, what it really does also, Cynthia, as you said, coming in '29, it's adding to that growth profile beyond our current 3- or 4-year look. Now you're talking about into '29 and beyond, which filling up that hopper is important for us, and this really adds to that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Robert Hope And I want to kind of follow up on the filling the hopper comment. As you take a look at that $8 billion to $9 billion of annual investment capacity, when you take a look out over the next couple of years, how full are you on that? Do you have a wealth of opportunities in front of you that you are, we'll call it, cherry-picking the best projects? 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1899670452&ts=3296847&ref=l6cin7 13/18

Page 14
And kind of where do you think you have the most room to kind of backfill the capital plan? Gregory Ebel Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then maybe Pat will want to add. Yes, I mean, we do have a wealth of opportunities. So it goes back to that issue of which -- there's different elements, right? So if I look at our projects in Western Canada, we've got some great projects there, but they're a little bit further out. When I look at things like GDS or some of the regional activities that Colin was just talking about or the projects we just announced on the solar side, they're coming in, in '25 and '26. So I think we've been able to pick off the ones with the best returns, soonest additions to EBITDA while still being able to look at, well, let's face it, long-haul pipelines take longer to build. And those are actually filling up the hopper outside of our numbers. So I think when you look at it, Pat, we're in a good spot to be able to fund all that as well as the ongoing maintenance capital to keep the business running reliably with integrity. Patrick Murray Yes, I think we've still got a little bit of capacity in the next 2 years here to do things like, Matthew -- to do some of the stuff Michele's group is doing within the utilities. I think this third quarter is kind of a microcosm of what we should see over the next little while, the diversity of the opportunities. We've got the quick-turn capital, high returning capital coming out of Matthew's green power business. We've got the start of a bunch of real projects within Michele's that's helping to serve the data center and increasing electrification. And then we've got a long- term end-of-decade type of project in Cynthia's business. So I like the fact that it's diverse from a spend profile, diverse from when they come into service, helping to extend our growth and reaffirm the growth over 2026. So we still got a little bit of capacity in '25 and '26 to continue to do stuff and lots in the back part of the decade. So really excited about the opportunities here. And we're going to try and pick the best of the best as we go forward. Gregory Ebel Rob, if you think about it -- it's probably on our website from last year, I think we've got that $8 billion to $9 billion capacity slide. We're utilizing $6 billion to $7 billion which leaves us a couple of billion dollars for these opportunities to come along. So that's a good one to refresh, take a look at. Robert Hope And then maybe to follow up there, like as you take a look at the tuck-in M&A market, could this be an opportunity to give you that data -- that $8 billion to $9 billion? And what opportunities are you seeing to be most interesting in the tuck-in market? Gregory Ebel Definitely something we're always watching. We're big, so we get to see those, but they got to compete against the organic stuff. So when you've got a couple of billion dollars or more a year of opportunities that come up, again, whether it's distribution, renewables, regional pipes, they're going to have to compete both from an accretion perspective and from a balance sheet perspective, right? 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

So I would argue in 2023, we picked off some really great assets, whether it's storage stuff, whether it's the utility work or some of the pieces we picked up on the renewable side, that was a good time to make those moves. So we'll be picky going forward because that's helped build up the hopper at really nice multiples relative to what I would suggest you'll see today, which will still be higher multiples as people look at the value of these assets and some of those secular changes I talked about really make the value of all these assets from liquids right through to renewables more valuable than they were a year ago. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Theresa Chen First, would you be able to provide an updated outlook on the Rio Bravo Pipeline project given that the D.C. Circuit vacated the FERC authorization for the liquefaction facility in early August. Does this change the time line for the pipeline project? And what are your general expectations for next steps and time line to resolve the legal issue? Cynthia Hansen So Theresa, it's Cynthia again. We're extremely disappointed by the D.C. Circuit's vacature of Rio Bravo Section 7 certificate. And basically, that Rio Bravo is now held by the Whistler parent JV. So we're supporting that ongoing work through our JV partnership. It's not unprecedented to hear for the D.C. Circuit to get involved in these kind of permitting processes. And the FERC has had a strong track record of figuring out how to navigate this space in the past. Right now, it's not having a material impact on our Enbridge guidance. Now the CEO of NextDecade, Matt Schatzman, has said that they're going to continue to focus on keeping that project on track, make sure it's online to be in service in '27. And I think they've recently, both Rio Bravo and Rio Grande, have filed petitions for rehearing to make sure that we can go forward with that, and there's been strong industry support. So a number of amicus briefs, we've supported it. Industry associations have supported that. So I think it's really important for us to get that clarity and that regulatory approval process. And there's more to come on that, but it's something that we're watching and supporting. Theresa Chen Great. And further east in the Gulf Coast, would you be able to provide an update on the Venice Extension project servicing the Plaquemines facility, just given recent concerns of delays for the start-up on the liquefaction side. Can you remind us when do you expect volumes to ramp up more significantly? And when do your commitments begin? I.e., will you be paid regardless of ramp-up with this year-end 2024 time line? Cynthia Hansen Yes. Theresa. Well, great news. As of today, we are flowing through our White Castle facilities. So that's serving about 0.8 Bcf. And we think that the 2 other stations, [indiscernible] will be in service by the end of the year. And 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 16
so we're already starting to receive some payments associated with those facilities. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish Just going back to solar. So it seems like interconnect agreements, that's the main driver here for moving forward with quick return -- quick-cycle projects with high returns. I guess, can you talk about how much more interconnection capacity you have that could support more of these type of projects? And then just to clarify, the mid-teens return for the solar project that you sanctioned, is that for the first year, including the upfront ITC? Or is that the IRR over the life of the project? Matthew Akman Yes. Praneeth. It's Matthew again. Just on your last part first. This is actually going to be a PTC project, not an ITC. So it's nice because it's kind of more smooth across the multiyear period. So it will provide that kind of stable contracted reliable cash flow for many years to come. And yes, it will be immediately accretive solidly right out of the chute and then for all the years forward. So that's kind of the overall profile. And sure, when we talk about returns, it's always life of project. In terms of what else we have, yes, we've got a great pipeline. Some of that was stuff that we have been cultivating for a number of years internally. And then just over 2 years ago, we acquired Tri Global Energy and they had a bunch of stuff. So we've got probably a couple of gigawatts of -- up to a couple of gigawatts of solar with interconnection agreements. We've got great discussions going on with all the data centers, as you can imagine, and other blue chips on that. And then we've got about 1 gigawatt of wind that's interconnection ready. So overall, we've got a few gigawatts still here that we can roll out. Again, all the stuff has to compete on returns as we always said on renewable, and we're getting those. And as long as it does continue to compete on returns in a low-risk contracted model, then we look forward to rolling a bunch more of this out in the coming years. Gregory Ebel Yes, I think we said at Enbridge Day is that we might spend $1 billion a year on this. This is probably a bigger year than we said back then, and that has all to do with the returns we're seeing, the quick turn of that capital and how it competes in the early years here. So I think if Matthew can continue to bring these types of projects with the return and quick turn that we like, we can continue to do more of them. Praneeth Satish Got it. No, that's helpful. And then you've highlighted throughout the call opportunities with data centers on the LDC side, renewables business. I guess what are you seeing along Texas Eastern and the U.S. gas pipeline 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1899670452&ts=3296847&ref=l6cin7 16/18

Page 17
assets in terms of potential discussions with utilities that are building out gas plants or data centers directly for behind-the-meter solutions? Maybe if you could just give us an update on that. Cynthia Hansen Yes. Praneeth. We've said this before. We have 45% of all of the North American power generation that's within 50 miles of our Enbridge pipeline. So we are really well situated. And that's not just for data centers, but that's for other power demand. We still have coal-to-gas switching, the onshore industrialization that we're seeing. But specifically, for that data center focus, we're seeing inbounds across that region. But also recently, in the U.S. Southeast, we have that 0.7 Bcf per day of increased demand to support about 4.5 gigawatts of new gas-fired generation. So we're seeing a lot of inbounds. We're working through that. I think we're continuing to be really well positioned to support the data center build out. Gregory Ebel Praneeth, just one thing I'd just add is that it's not just opportunities. I don't want you to take it -- these are actual things that are being done today. I hear a lot about opportunities, which is great. That's building it. But this Duke buildup is happening right now. This data center connection in Utah is happening now. Fox Squirrel with Amazon is happening right now. So yes, the opportunity is there. But I think uniquely to us versus some others, and that's because of where the assets are, the interconnection of the different businesses and how we can offer things. That stuff is happening now. So it's both current and opportunity going forward. Praneeth Satish Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just sneak one real quick, last question in here. With the recent flooding in North Carolina with Hurricane Helene, has that had any impact on your PSNC business? Gregory Ebel Well, first of all, most importantly, it's had a terrible impact on people, right? And so that's -- I'm really proud of the team there and how they've stepped up and helped the community. But operationally and financially, if you go there, no. I mean, yes, we had things to do, replacement, but all the folks are back online now. If you need gas, we're getting gas. There are some homes that were completely destroyed, those hooked up, but that's not a large number. But Asheville is back with terms of gas service from PSNC. Any of those costs that do come up would just go into a deferral account. Again, important element of regulatory structure for utilities, right? Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Morley for closing remarks. 3/1/25, 11:58 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

We delivered record EBITDA and DCF per share in 2024, with new assets and continued customer demand contributing to a 13% increase in EBITDA over 2023. In December, we increased our dividend for the 30th consecutive year, extending our status as one of the only dividend aristocrats in our sector. And while I'm pleased that Enbridge delivered a 37% total shareholder return to investors in 2024, I'm even more pleased that our business model will continue to generate strong returns for our shareholders as we advance our strategic priorities. On the growth front, we closed the acquisition of 3 premier U.S. natural gas utilities, creating the largest gas utility franchise in North America. We also announced 3 highly strategic tuck-in acquisitions of Permian and Gulf Coast assets, building on our integrated oil footprint and establishing a meaningful natural gas presence in the region. Across the business, we added over $8 billion of organic projects to our backlog, diversified across all 4 of our franchises. That backlog now includes approximately $3 billion of annual utility investment, earning strong returns under quick cycle capital writers and regulated return frameworks. Prudent capital recycling remains an important part of our business model, allowing us to opportunistically surface value for shareholders. And in April, we closed the sale of our interest in Alliance and Aux Sable, and subsequently announced the sale of our interest in the East to West Tie Line for combined proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. Our long-held leverage target of 4.5 to 5x continues to be the sweet spot for Enbridge, and we expect full year contributions from our recently acquired and in-service assets to benefit this metric through 2025. We'll continue the equity self-fund up to $8 billion to $9 billion of growth projects annually, staying within our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, while supporting future growth for Enbridge and driving returns for shareholders. Now let's spend a minute reviewing our low-risk business model that allows us to perform so consistently. 2024 marks Enbridge's 19th consecutive year of achieving guidance, underscoring the stability of our business despite the myriad of macroeconomic challenges we've seen these past 2 decades. And looking ahead, with the uncertainty around North American trade relations, I want to remind everyone how each franchise has a commercial framework that will ensure reliable low-risk cash flows. In liquids, the mainline is supported by an ROE performance collar and a progressive toll ratchet on Line 3 surcharge, providing 2 forms of volume protection. And the rest of our liquid systems are predominantly underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts. In our Gas Transmission business, our pipelines operate under a mix of cost of service framework and negotiated take or pay rates, delivering over 24 Bcf per day of natural gas to customers. Our utility business is fully regulated with flow-through cost structures, inclusive of the cost of natural gas supply. And in renewables, our projects are backed by long-term power purchase agreements with high-quality customers and governance. Our commitments to discipline gives us confidence that we can extend our track record of meeting financial guidance, steadily growing our dividend and continuing to create value for our investors. Now let's spend a minute talking about how we're positioned to meet increasing natural gas infrastructure demand and serve our customers. Enbridge is the only major midstream company with a portfolio that offers long-haul gas transmission, the reliability of utility infrastructure and the emissions benefits of renewable power. This unique combination allows us to provide diverse and comprehensive energy solutions for electric power, that not only meet the affordability and reliability needs of customers, but also support their long-term sustainability goals as well. 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

In 2024, we added over $5 billion of gas and renewable projects. Those include pipeline projects for more than 2 gigawatts of new natural gas generation in Tennessee and Carolina. A new Permian gas egress pipeline, which directly supports U.S. Gulf Coast LNG, 2 sets of offshore pipelines in the Gulf and the sanctioning of approximately 1.2 gigawatts of solar in Ohio and Texas. We're pleased with what we've delivered so far, and we expect we'll be able to continue sanctioning attractive projects across each of our franchises. Now I'll jump into the business update, starting with Liquids. 2024 was a milestone year for LP with record annual volumes on Gray Oak, Ingleside and Flanagan South. We fully expect that under all Canada-U.S. trade relation outcomes, Canadian oil will continue to flow south, and our main line is the vital conduit, supplying downstream demand centers across the continent and ensuring energy security for millions of North American consumers and workers. As we expected, the mainline experienced strong volumes all year, averaging throughput of 3.1 million barrels per day, even with TMX entering service. In addition, the mainline has been back in apportionment since November, reflecting continued strong demand for our system. And that demand, alongside our operational excellence, has us earning near the upper end of our ROE collar earlier than expected. As the basin grows, we continue to advance conversations with customers to develop additional WCSB egress for late 2026, early '27, and later in the decade. Additionally, we also signed a letter of intent with the government of Alberta to accelerate future expansion opportunities across our system and support their growth ambitions. And in order to bring more condensate to Canada, we're proceeding with a very capital-efficient customer-backed expansion of Southern Lights pipeline. Earlier this year, we announced 120,000 barrel per day expansion of the Gray Oak pipeline to support growing demand from shippers seeking delivery to Corpus Christi, where our Ingleside facility is located. We're expanding our storage offering at Ingleside to support those additional volumes on Gray Oak, and we also acquired and plumbed in 2 nearby docks, which dramatically increased Ingleside's VLCC loading windows. All told, our liquids franchise is positioned to grow and provide industry-leading service to customers across the continent. Our gas transmission business experienced another year of high utilization in 2024. And that's continuing into '25. And once again, we are 100% recontracted on our gas pipes this year. In fact, we've already seen a few new throughput records on our systems over the last few weeks. Our total U.S. transmission system recorded its two highest delivery days ever in January, supported by all-time highs on Maritimes and Northeast U.S. as well as a couple of top 10 days on Texas Eastern and Algonquin. Two of our storage facilities, Egan Hub and Moss Bluff recorded some of their highest ever daily withdrawals in January as well. During 2024, we sanctioned approximately $4 billion of new capital projects, predominantly focused around the U.S. Gulf Coast infrastructure, extending our growth backlog through the decade. The U.S. federal government has now announced reversal of the LNG pause on non-FTA facilities, and that's bolstered our confidence in other LNG expansion opportunities. In the fourth quarter, we placed the Venice extension project into service, and it's now supplying natural gas to the Plaquemines LNG terminal in Louisiana. We also completed a 6.5 Bcf expansion of Tres Palacios, gas storage facility in Texas, enhancing our competitive service offering for Gulf Coast customers along our Texas Eastern system. In the Permian, we purchased a 19% interest in the Whistler joint venture partnering with WhiteWater Midstream and MPLX and establishing an integrated and growing natural gas footprint in the area. Alongside these partners, 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 3/16

Page 4
we sanctioned the Blackcomb pipeline, which is expected to enter service in 2026 and provide up to 2.5 Bcf per day of natural gas egress out of the Permian Basin. And in the third quarter, we announced our acquisition of a 15% stake in the DBR system, a key conduit for the Whistler pipeline. These investments will drive growth opportunities through the decade. On the regulatory front, we recently received approval from the Canadian energy regulator for our $1.2 billion Aspen Point T-North expansion, ensuring capacity to serve growing LNG demand on our BC pipe system. And in the U.S., we reached and filed a negotiated settlement with customers on Texas Eastern, as well as reaching settlements in principle on both Algonquin gas transmission and Maritimes U.S. New rates on Texas Eastern have been in effect since October 1, 2024, and we expect FERC approval of the AGT and Maritimes and Northeast settlements later this year. Now let's turn to GDS. The utility franchise has approximately doubled in size this year, having brought Enbridge Gas, Ohio, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming and North Carolina in-house. The gas distribution and storage business is now delivering over 9 Bcf per day of gas to over 7 million customers. Our team is working every day to deliver reliable and affordable natural gas to these customers, and we continue to invest in key infrastructure across North America to meet growing customer demand. To that point, both Enbridge Gas in North Carolina and Ohio both hit new daily all-time throughput records last month. Enbridge Gas Utah moved its fourth highest daily gas throughput in history, and Enbridge Gas Ontario delivered a single day record for the most gas storage withdrawals out of the Dawn Hub. Each of our 4 utilities are critically important to their markets, and we expect to invest about $3 billion annually across our utility franchise, earning strong returns under quick cycle capital frameworks. For example, here are a few of our larger utility projects underway. At our Ontario utility, we anticipate sanctioning the St. Laurent pipeline project in the coming months. A $200 million multiphase development, enhancing our existing footprint in Ottawa. North Carolina has two exciting projects to highlight this quarter. The T15 project will serve Duke Energy's new Roxboro natural gas power generation plant, and Moriah establishes an LNG gasification facility in Person County to support system reliability. Both are great examples of essential in footprint developments, ensuring reliable and growing service offerings for customers. We are making strong progress integrating all the new assets into the Enbridge family. Now let's jump into renewables before passing it off to Pat. Throughout 2024, we advanced our renewables platform under our utility-like business model. We're pursuing growing projects with high-quality blue chip customers that are in strong risk-adjusted investment returns. In 2024, we sanctioned approximately 1.2 net gigawatts of new [ quick cycle ] solar projects and almost 20% of that capacity is already operating. I'm excited to announce that the entire Fox Squirrel facility in Ohio is now in service, generating 577 megawatts of renewable power under long-term contracts with Amazon. Earlier this year, we sanctioned the Orange Grove solar project, which will generate 130 megawatts of power under long-term agreements with AT&T and support the growing electric generation needs of the ERCOT market. We also sanctioned the Sequoia Solar project in Texas, which is supported by power purchase agreements with customers, including AT&T and Toyota. In Europe, we continue to advance our offshore portfolio, having placed Fecamp and Provence Grand Large into service in 2024. Both those facilities are supported by long-term PPAs with EDF. Manufacturing is largely completed for Calvados and the drilling campaign is underway. We now expect the project to enter service in 2027, which is later than our original schedule. 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

With that, I'll pass it off to Pat to review our financial performance. Patrick Murray Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Greg. This has been a busy year for us, and I'm pleased to report record fourth quarter and full year EBITDA and DCF per share. For the quarter, EBITDA increased considerably to over $5.1 billion, reflecting an over $1 billion increase from the same period last year. Our DCF per share for the quarter rose to $1.41, an approximately 10% increase over last year, and our adjusted earnings per share rose to $0.75 per share, reflecting a 17% increase over the same time frame. Liquids EBITDA benefited from toll escalators on the mainline, strong throughput on our Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent assets and lower power costs. That was partially offset by lower ex-Gretna volumes. Although 2024 was stronger than we anticipated, '23 had realized a record fourth quarter. Gas Transmission was up significantly from 2023, owing to contributions from the Whistler JV, Tomorrow RNG, Aitken Creek as well as TETCO rate settlement taking effect on October 1. And as a reminder, we achieved that GTM growth despite the sale of our interest in the Alliance and Aux Sable partnerships in the second quarter of 2024. For the first time, our gas distribution business reflects a full quarter of EBITDA from all 3 U.S. LDCs acquired in 2024. This drives the $500 million or so of year-over-year increase within the segment. In renewable power, we recognized another tranche of investment tax credits relating to the Fox Squirrel Phase 2, alongside a full quarter of contributions from our higher interest in Hohe See and Albatros assets acquired in Q4 2023. Below the line, higher average rate and debt balances from the closure of the various U.S. utilities resulted in higher financing costs in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Reflecting on full year results, 2024 EBITDA exceeded our recast guidance range supported by strong utilization and demand across all franchises as well as a weakening CAD to U.S. foreign exchange rate. For DCF, we finished the year just below our guidance midpoint despite prefunding the U.S. gas utilities. A great outcome and a testament to the growth within our business. As Greg mentioned earlier, this marks our 19th consecutive year achieving or exceeding our financial guidance. And while it's early, we're currently on pace to extend that track record in '25. On that note, I'm pleased to reaffirm the '25 guidance we provided in December. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA between $19.4 billion and $20 billion, and DCF per share of $5.50 to $5.90 per share. Full year LDC contributions, new assets in service and continued cost-saving initiatives are expected to drive the majority of the growth in 2025. Although early, so far, the mainline has been in [ portion meant ] all year. We've experienced colder weather in Ontario and the current strength of the U.S. dollar could be tailwinds if experienced for the entire year. These can be partially offset by a slower-than-expected decline in U.S. interest rates. I'm also reaffirming our midterm outlook and look forward to discussing this with the investment community in a few weeks at our upcoming Investor Day. Now I'll close my remarks with a refresher on our long-held commitment to capital discipline before passing it back to Greg. Our 3-pillar approach to capital allocation is unchanged in 2025. The balance sheet will remain strictly in focus with our financial guardrails governing all investment decisions. We expect full year contributions from the U.S. gas utilities that closed in 2024 to benefit our leverage metric in '25. A thoughtful capital recycling program has been a cornerstone of our business for decades, and we successfully recycled over $15 billion of assets since 2014, including our recently announced East West Tie Line sale. 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Sustainably returning capital via a low-risk dividend is a hallmark of our investment offering. We're committed to growing the dividend, supported by our diversified and high-quality cash flow profile. Lastly, on growth, you can expect us to prioritize brownfield investment at low multiples when sanctioning new projects to supplement our backlog. Our capital backlog now sits at $26 billion, with $5 billion of assets placed into service in '24 and $8 billion of newly sanctioned projects added through 2029. As always, a special thank you to all the team members for delivering on another exceptional year. With that, I'll pass it back to Greg to finish the presentation. Gregory Ebel Well, thanks very much, Pat. And again, 2024 caps off a record year of financial and operational performance here at Enbridge. Our steadily growing dividend supported by a utility-like cash flow profile remains a cornerstone of our investment offering as demonstrated by 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. The complementary nature of our overlapping businesses will continue to drive growth, enable optimization and enhance our opportunity set through the decade. Enbridge is a first choice investment opportunity, offering an attractive yield alongside visible long-term growth that is largely insulated from economic gyrations. Before we close, I'll remind everyone to please join us on March 4 for our Annual Investor Day in New York. The team is excited to see you and share the opportunities being realized across the organization and driving our future growth. With that, I'd like to thank you all for listening, and operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet Also want to send the team a Happy Valentine's Day as well. Just curious, I guess, with the WCSB production and growth opportunities there and initiatives, I guess, out of Alberta, if you could talk a bit more on how you see that I guess, unfolding over what type of time frame and how large could this actually scale over time in your view? Gregory Ebel Yes. Well, maybe I'll just start, but I'll turn it over to Colin very quickly here. But you're on it, and we'll send the love back to you, too, on Valentine's Day. But I will say you're really seeing great opportunities on production growth. And we're looking at a lot of quick hit permit-light, low multiple brownfield type activities on the liquids front to serve the markets on both sides of the border. So you're going to hear more about that during Investor Day. But Colin, do you want to speak to a little bit about what we've been doing in the last month or so? Colin Gruending Yes. I mean it's only been, Jeremy, it's only been about a month since that announcement. And we have been working few percent even before then. I would view that announcement as an endorsement of our role and our 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

playbook. We'll look to tell you a whole bunch more in a couple of weeks at Embers Day, but maybe zoom out a bit further, FIDing a number of projects in the calendar year. Fundamentally, I think production is surprising to the upside. Not huge capital projects by our customers. But as you've been reading lots of debottlenecking and optimizations, potentially rerating that kit. And then on the demand side, strong as well. So it's shaping up well and there's infrastructure opportunities from tip to stern, regionally mainline market access and export. We'll tell you more. Gregory Ebel Yes. And Jeremy, kind of like my opening comments, I mentioned, it's just one aspect that gives us really great confidence about continuing our growth right through the decade. And equally, you would have seen apportionment in the last few months. So not only are the pipes being used, but the requirements for more are definitely there. So look forward to talking about that further in a couple of weeks. Jeremy Tonet Got it. We will wait for more details then. And at the risk of a question that might be more fully answered at Analyst Day as well. Just wondering, with the new regime in D.C. in different policies towards energy and energy infrastructure development in general. Wondering if you could share any thoughts on what that means for Enbridge, particularly around Line 5 or otherwise? Gregory Ebel Yes, sure. Well, I think the first and foremost thing, and you've heard us say this and others as well, but we've got the portfolio that backs it up. It's an all of the above energy solution that's going to be needed. So if you've got Liquids, if you've got natural gas assets and you got power assets, it's on. If you got export assets, it's on. So we've got all those pieces. So I think that's positive. I think a more rational approach to sustainability issues, taxation, permitting reform, I would expect all those are going to be pretty critical to us. And we're already seeing it, again, just with requests for -- and you probably seen it in our deck, requests for things like gas generation, as Colin just mentioned on the oil side, I think that's going to be extremely positive. We've -- sure, let's get into it. We've got tariff concerns out there, but there's such a hard wiring of the energy system in North America. We just don't see that as a material impact. And I think given what we're seeing from customers, that's actually bearing out in reality, and we're going to see it happen on the investment side as well. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier I want to continue on the Liquids side here. I wondered if you could comment on the discourse that has been popping up about the need to diversify our markets for energy. 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 7/16

In the event that Canada develops the political well, can you indicate your appetite and under what circumstances you'd invest in a long-haul liquids pipeline in Canada such as Northern Gateway or even a line going East? Gregory Ebel Sure. Thanks, Rob. Look, that's a really thoughtful question, and we've obviously given a lot of thought to that. I will start by saying that we're really focused intently more on broader themes, macro trends like production, demand growth, earnings, returns on capital than day-to-day political gyrations. But that said, we're not blind to the trade discussions and disputes. But real sustainable trends aren't made in a day or a month, takes a long time. So again, that's why we're focused on some of the stuff we were just talking about in terms of relatively low capital short plays. And that's going to be the reality for a long time to come that gas, oil, energy is going to move north and south more than it does East and West. But specifically, say, to Northern Gateway, I'm really pleased to see Canadian policymakers focused on that issue and realizing the true benefits of diverse markets. We've pitched that for a long time. And I think our views on LNG and liquids exports are well known. We've said for years that we've been missing the boat, pun intended on that for a long time. We worked really hard on Northern Gateway first time around, right, in service, hopefully, for Canadians, we had permits, we had regulatory approvals, indigenous participation, strong customer support. Unfortunately, that project was cut short by the federal government, which really cost us hundreds of millions of dollars and our investors that, right? So that's a powerful earn. So for us to be willing to seriously consider reinvesting in a project like that, whether it's East or West or just West, we need to see real change on numerous fronts. Let me tell you about that. One, things like what Premier Smith and Alberta has been doing in terms of making positive moves to commit volumes on some of these major pipes. And seeking internal solutions to energy mobility in Canada and North America. We would need to see real legislative change at the federal and provincial government level that specifically identifies major infrastructure projects like Northern Gateway as being in the national interest and therefore, legally required. [ Lake Sea ] permitting changes. And for example, they're eliminating C-69, C-59, all that would be a positive indicator for a change in the trend towards energy infrastructure. Another example, you got to see support for energy production as opposed to reducing it, which you see through emission caps and carbon tax, more indigenous consultation engagement and direct participation via loan guarantees that, frankly, that loan guarantee program that exists now would be way too small for meaningful projects on that front. And we believe you'd likely need CapEx cost and reasonable return trackers to ensure you could actually attract the kind of capital we're talking about to such projects. So Robert, it's a lot of coordinated federal and pan- provincial legislative and regulatory action would be required before we think investors, management teams or customers would be able to greenlight such projects. Lots of talk from governments and policymakers, which is great. They're saying the right things, but it's going to take real actions, laws, regulation to attract the capital in our view. Robert Catellier That's a great answer, and I can only hope that the politicians understand the need for a better risk transfer mechanism to undertake these massive projects given the history. So just another quick one here on the renewables. I'm just curious if you're seeing anything coming out of the Trump administration that -- maybe you could just update your outlook for what you expect on onshore 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 8/16

renewables under the new administration and what it could mean for reducing the gap between your DCF per share and the other per share metrics. [Technical Difficulty] Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing some technical difficulties. Please stand by we will begin momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing some technical difficulties. Please stand by we will begin momentarily. Gregory Ebel Rob, sorry, we got disconnected there. So hopefully, I was just saying now it's a nice spot to be in from a capital allocator perspective. All of our business units have opportunities, which mean we get to pick the ones with the very best returns, which works for investors. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO Capital Markets. Benjamin Pham Maybe on the renewable side of things. I know it's a good quarter, new projects coming in. And I know you have some comments on the similar situation in the U.S. Can you comment on maybe just given how the public equities have performed the last couple of years, meaningful underperformance? Like how does that look relative to developing renewable power assets? Gregory Ebel Well, maybe I'll start, but I'm sure Matthew will have some thoughts. I mean, first of all, I think it goes to the customers, and you can see who we're signing up, the Amazons, AT&Ts, Toyotas, and I think you'll see some other big tech data center type people signing up with us. That they want to work with big players. And they also want to see differentiated opportunities. So whether it's just solar, whether it's -- whether it's wind and also gas. So I think we're in a good spot to be able to provide in different jurisdictions, multiple offerings, and we're a big player. They know we are going to get the stuff done. And then -- maybe Matthew can speak a little bit to the purchase of our development team in Dallas, too. Matthew Akman Yes. So thanks, Ben. So yes, the public equities, obviously, is it really boils down to the model that we pursue on renewables. It's the low-risk commercial model. And you're seeing a lot of different things play into those public companies, whether it be big write-downs that you've seen in offshore. Some of them in trouble on development 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 9/16

Page 10
or supply chain. And this is where our competitive advantage really kicks in, in terms of -- the fact that we have the supply chain capabilities, we don't take big speculative risk on offshore leases. All of our power is fully contracted, as you've seen, the most high-quality blue-chip counterparties. And so what we're seeing on our side is, frankly, opportunity. And I think the few big players that have that capability will continue to see, as we've seen, very strong risk profiles and very strong returns. And as you see in the results, and I think you mentioned this record results in renewable, it just shows that we're getting great returns. And that these projects and investments are accretive right off the hop, both on cash flow and earnings per share. So we look forward to more of that. Benjamin Pham Okay. And just the U.S. gas utilities, even [ Enbridge Gas ] too. Can you comment on where the realized ROEs trended during 2024 versus [ allowed ]? Michele Harradence Where the realized ROEs trended during 2024? Is that your question, Ben? Benjamin Pham Yes. Michele Harradence So generally, we expect all our utilities to track and to meet their expected ROEs or their allowed ROEs. And they're very steady the U.S. utilities. They don't have any exposure to weather and that sort of thing. So we're very pleased with how Ohio, North Carolina and Utah as well as Wexpro for that matter, finished the year. They all finished on budget and exactly where we were expecting them to. In Ontario, as I think you would have seen through our quarterly reports, it was a very, very mild winter last year. So that impacted our realized ROE for Ontario. We won't file that -- the finished or the certain ROE until the fall, but we would be below that based on the weather results. Gregory Ebel I think on a weather-normalized basis, Ben, they're all in the 10% range, right. So just like the gas transmission stuff out in Western Canada, which is very solid, steady, quick cycle, as you know, getting that 10% return on equity with very little risk. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Manav Gupta 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 10/16

Page 11
Congrats on a strong quarter. Your guidance generally tends to be a little conservative as it was in 2024. Help us understand what could drive you towards the top end of that guidance for 2025? Gregory Ebel Yes. Thanks for the question. I think historically, if you looked at our performance, we usually fit right within kind of the guidance range that we have. We overperformed a little on EBITDA this year, which is great to see. But I think, if you think about guidance for next year, we've had lots of commentary around the fact that it was set on a $1.35, so if we stay above that, that will be helpful from a tailwind perspective. You should remember though, that we do hedge a pretty significant amount of that. When we released guidance back in December, we kind of gave a sensitivity that for every $0.01 that the dollar stays above that $1.35 all a year, that's about $0.01 of DCF and about $50 million of EBITDA. So you can kind of get an assertation of where that might land as a result of that. Michele just noted that last year, we had colder weather, in fact -- or sorry, warmer weather, significantly warm weather. This year, starting off fairly good. We've got some colder weather in Ontario and even Eastern U.S., which I think can help that. But maybe just offsetting that potentially is U.S. interest rates is not coming down quite to the same extent that maybe we thought they would, given how inflation has kind of stayed in the U.S. So I think when you take all those together, and remember, it's pretty early in the year. I think we're pretty comfortable still with the guidance range that we have, maybe with a few extra tailwinds and headwinds at this time. Manav Gupta Perfect. My quick follow-up is here is, help us understand the kinds of discussions you're having with data center operators, incremental power, your leverage to the entire positive data center power market demand? Gregory Ebel Yes, for sure. Look, it's not just talk, right. I mean we're actually signing up and executing on projects. We've talked a little bit before about the 1.5 gigawatt pipeline we're building for TVA on the gas side, that's all driven by electricity demand in North Carolina. A 1.4 gigawatt project for Duke. That's all driven by demand. In Utah, we've connected several players, call it, a couple of hundred behind the meter megawatt plays. In Ontario, lots of discussion with the data centers, specifically. Ohio, we've just -- we're connecting a 1 gigawatt facility there. So that's 5 gigawatts just in that group between GDS and GTM that we have just signed up and are executing on power generation, and you throw on 2 gigawatts on solar. And again, you've seen the likes of the AT&Ts and Amazon. So yes, there's a whole boatload of folks that we're having conversations with. It's not all the big players. There's a bunch of small players, too. So if you think about each gigawatt, call it, about 200 million cubic feet a day or so. Every -- every Bcf, you add 5 gigawatts, you're going to get a Bcf of demand on the infrastructure side. So we're seeing that. Also we're going to talk about this more at Investor Day, too. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets. 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 11/16

Page 12
Maurice Choy Just wanted to touch on capital allocation for a moment here. If tariffs do occur meaningfully and are prolonged. What adjustments, if anything, at all, do you see in your capital allocation strategy, be that geographically types of infrastructure types? Any adjustments that you see being necessary? Gregory Ebel Yes. I would say, unless it's a very high tariff and on a prolonged basis, we just don't see significant changes on that front. If you think about starting at GDS and GTMs on the gas side, those flows largely don't go back and forth across the border. There's some of that, that goes on, but not a significant way. As you know, we're continuing to invest in export facilities, both on the liquids and the LNG side. Those are going to continue to happen. So I just don't see a significant change in the near term. We talked a little bit about major East West projects, but I'm not 100% sure -- or just West projects, those are going to happen anytime soon. I'd say we're just very focused on some of these short quick-hit projects. You're going to continue to see the products move back and forth across the border on the liquid side of things. And we're very focused on supply chain issues. Fortunately, being a big player and usually #1 or #2 customer for so much of the equipment we get for steel, et cetera. I think we're in a great position on that front. The projects that we're executing today, we've looked at, and we just don't see any material impacts on those as well. So obviously, it's a longer-term issue, but in the near term, I don't see a dramatic impact. Maurice Choy That's a good point about timing here between longer-term solution versus, say, a 4-year presidential term. And maybe on that point, are there any parts of the energy value chain, whether on liquids or gas, but you see that it's probably worth while bulking up, given all the political uncertainty that we have on both sides of the border? Gregory Ebel Well, sure. Look, I think -- and it's call us good, call us lucky, bulking up on the gas side in the last couple of years, both on the distribution side and on the gas transmission side. We bought multiple storage facilities. We entered into new gas deals out of the Permian. All that stuff is front run this and puts us really in the pole position on that front. Sometimes I've often heard of the big 4 being talked about in gas, but we're the real deal in gas. And so I think we continue to move those projects forward. So happy on that side. And then that being said, as Colin laid out and we'll lay out again in March, I think there's great opportunities on the liquids side, too. So I think we've got the right portfolio in the right jurisdictions, both in and through North America and out of North America. That's a good spot to be in. And you're even seeing on the gas side, offshore activities. I think that was kind of looked over last year, but new projects that we're looking at the offshore Gulf of -- on the Gulf. And that's going to be exciting for us as we move through the end of the decade. Operator 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 13
Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Robert Hope Maybe to stick with permitting. The BC government has accelerated some permits for the Aspen project on T- North there. Can you maybe update us on discussions regarding the larger capital plan there and whether or not you could see some acceleration of permitting and construction there? Gregory Ebel Sure, Cynthia is right here. Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks, Rob. So we are very excited to see that the BC government is supporting the Aspen Point project. We had gotten our big CER approval for that project. We're continuing to work through that. There is still some permitting from the BC Hydro point for some power connections. So that's all really positive. We're a big supporter obviously, of the gas infrastructure in BC. We are a pipeline that continues to deliver both to the industrial and residential base there as part and largely supporting the LNG exports as well. So we think this is a great thing. There's lots of opportunities for growth there. It's a great business for us. You know that, that is a true cost of service business. And as Greg said, we get a really -- our return there, our ROE at 10% is something that we really like in our portfolio. Robert Hope Appreciate that. And then maybe just sticking with gas, but moving over to the gas distribution side. You now have the U.S. assets under belt for a little while there. How the integration process gone? And are you able to potentially see some early signs of some [ chunkier ] projects kind of like the ones that you're seeing in the Carolinas? Michele Harradence Yes. You bet that Rob, it's Michele here. Now that we've closed all the utilities. We have them in. The integration, first of all, is going really well so far. Of course, there's lots of work to do. But we're definitely seeing the benefits of bringing these utilities together, whether it's the conversations, the pursuing of opportunities, to bringing customer solutions that worked in one area, taking it somewhere else. What I would say is I think the growth we anticipated at the time that we were looking at this, which would have been mid -- going back to mid-'23, it's certainly there. We're absolutely seeing the customer additions. We're seeing the modernization. But what we're really seeing is a nice tailwind on what I'd call the electrification side of things, so the power generation, whether that's for data centers or otherwise. And of course, natural gas plays a very obvious role that -- there. We're seeing that across our businesses. So Greg mentioned earlier, the data center growth, we're hooking up for power generation in every one of the utilities. I mean -- we've probably got 1.5 gigawatts that we're supporting right now in Ontario. And of course, the 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 13/16

Page 14
Ontario government has come out with its largest procurement ever, and we certainly see -- there's strong support from them to meet all of the above. We see a lot of growth happening there. Utah, the Wasatch Front, that's Ogden, Salt Lake, Provo, real area of focus for data centers. Natural gas power generators in Ohio. I mean, Ohio, I think we were looking at modernization, some pretty steady customer growth. We're seeing lots come on from -- whether it's data center driven or otherwise. And of course, we've talked about North Carolina. And that's a good example where there's 2 phases to that T15 project and Phase 2 has come on faster than we thought for a total between the 2 phases of close to 500 million cubic feet a day. So very, very happy with that. And customer growth is really good. Even -- like I said, that sleeper has kind of been in Ohio. We like to like something called the U-Haul rankings and North Carolina at the end of 2024, that was ranked third, state, third.. That's where people -- they measure where people move to growth in states. Utah went from 13 up to 9, and good old Ohio, they used to be 23 is up to 13. So folks are moving into the jurisdictions we're at. Continue to be super supportive of gas. We could not be happier with certainly the new utilities. But also, like I said, we're seeing some good growth on the power generation side in Ontario. Gregory Ebel What's nice is you get big projects and small projects. so sure might hook up 200-megawatt behind the meter stuff that might be $50 million. And those start adding up and they're really quick hit and quick cycle. And then as you said, you got like the North Carolina projects might be 1, 1.5 gigs, that's $500 million or $600 million. So you got a mix of all those projects with amazing counterparties. So yes, I mean we're thrilled with them. We're going to continue to grow those out. I think we're at like $3 billion in capital a year for the utilities on a combined basis, steady, quick cycle turn into EBITDA the next year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Theresa Chen I wanted to revisit the tariff discussion. With the headlines over the past couple of months, there has been a lot of noise on who would bear the cost of tariffs if they were to come to fruition and would endure? And it doesn't seem like there would be enough of demand elasticity to really impact the volumes on your system, especially when you think about the various contractual measures in place, be it ROE collar or [ MVC ] through the U.S. portion. But based on your analysis, if not the infrastructure provider, who do you think would bear the cost of that economic rent shift? Gregory Ebel Yes. I'm going to let Colin talk about which one of his customers might see that. Colin Gruending 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 14/16

Page 15
Thanks for that question. I think we agree generally with your synopsis of this, pretty sticky demand. You mentioned a number of the reasons. A number of our customers have integrated business models and infrastructure, right. Production, refining. We built a whole business around that. Supply switching to U.S. refiners, much has been said and written about that recently, but generally, suboptimal, right. So these are must run systems and society depends on it, right. So we view the impact on volumes on our systems, I think to be negligible in a tariff situation, again, depending on the size of the tariff. We think the tariff impact would likely be shared to some extent. And it depends on which region you're in, right. Where the refining options exist and don't exist. So it will vary, but I think it will be shared, Theresa. I don't know if you agree with that, but that's our view from our approach. Gregory Ebel The other thing we see, Theresa, let's not get too excited about the conversations, but also put it in context. So I think even this has been recognized by policymakers when you're at 10% on energy versus some other products that I think you're bang on. I mean the elasticity of that is pretty marginal. So we don't expect to see much change in that. If anything, I'm concerned about on tariffs, if they came in, does that have an impact on economic growth and if economic growth declines, then that could see a decline in energy demand. But even offset that with all the things that are going on, on generation and data centers and stuff, I'm not even sure that's material. So I think that's why we're trying to focus on the long-term trends, what's happened. And as Colin said, this is societal needs on all this front give us a lot of confidence that the tariff issue is not particularly material. Colin Gruending One more -- just data point here, maybe bring it to a head. We're seeing fulsome nominations, right, on the system, Jan-Feb sold out in the face of this. So that's the trend so far. Theresa Chen Got it. And turning to a different side of the regulatory discussion. Wanted to get Cynthia's take on what is the path forward at this point for Rio Bravo and Rio Grande following the series of executive orders by the sitting administration that repealed some of the regulations that required [indiscernible] reviews? And then FERC Council's subsequent letter to the D.C. Circuit earlier this month related to how the revocation was unwarranted. What do you think is going to happen from here? And can you tell us about the next steps? And any impediments or catalysts along the way? Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks, Theresa. So just as a reminder, that Rio Bravo pipeline is now being managed directly through the Whistler joint venture. But -- and so we still have an interest in that. My thoughts are that we have a new administration, there's lots of opportunity for clarity to come in through the process. We do know that the FERC is going through their supplemental environmental impact statement process of gathering that information, and that information is ready to be filed. 3/1/25, 11:57 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1916297879&ts=3375047&ref=l6cin7 15/16

Page 16
As you mentioned, there was additional information that next decade in Rio Bravo filed, stating that the executive orders should actually be taken into account for this process. So my expectation is we're going to continue to see Rio Bravo work with the FERC to move through that actual impact statement to update that. And there may be clarity even before that process. So both we and our partners through the joint venture and, of course, next decade, are going to continue to work through that process. And we have a lot of confidence that the project is going to continue to go forward. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Morley for closing remarks. Rebecca Morley Yes. Great. Thank you, and we appreciate your ongoing interest in Enbridge.

Today, we'll be giving you an update on our strategic plan and our priorities for managing and growing our business. Please note that this webcast is being recorded and at this time, I'd like to ask that you please ensure your devices have been set to silent mode. Before we begin, at Enbridge, it's important that we acknowledge Indigenous lands where we conduct our business, and we have a strong commitment to supporting reconciliation with the Indigenous nations and peoples. We honor and respect the traditional homeland of the Lenape peoples on which we meet. We also recognize that New York City is home to one of the largest urban native American populations in the United States. I would like to remind you that we'll be referring to forward-looking information in today's presentations and Q&A. By its nature, this information contains forecast assumptions and expectations about future outcomes which are subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined here and discussed more fully in our public filings. We'll also be referring to non-GAAP measures. In the case of an emergency, please note that we have an exit on the side and at the back of the room. And in the event of a fire alarm, the New York Stock Exchange security staff will help us with a safe evacuation. Now on to the agenda. We've changed our format for the day, and Greg will walk you through the specifics, we expect to wrap up around noon, after which we'll host a networking lunch. We hope that you can stay and engage with members of our executive team who are here with us today. For the Q&A, we'll have a microphone circulating. After each presentation, we ask that you state your name and your company and limit yourself to 1 question per session. So with that, let's get started. Before I welcome President and CEO, Greg Ebel to the stage, we'll share a quick video. [Presentation]  󰍉 ENB 󰍝  3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Gregory Ebel All right. Well, good morning, everybody. Thanks very much for being here, and it's a pleasure to have everybody here for our '24 Analyst Day. As that video just showed, 2023 was really a pretty incredible year for the company. We were able to deliver on the commitments that we laid out to all of you just a year ago at our Investor Day and extended our long track record of delivering value for shareholders while setting us up for, I think, continued growth and continued value creation. Today's format is going to be a little bit different. As Rebecca said, we talked to a lot of you during the year and heard what you said, how can we make this a little bit more informative? How can we make this a little bit more engaging for you? So we heard that and we decided to change things up. So many of the analysts in the room you use fireside chats during your conferences. So we plan to use a version of that today. We'll start by providing a bit of a brief overview and then have the leaders from each one of our businesses come forward on stage, and we'll have a little discussion about their business. And then we'll wrap up with Pat providing an overview on our capital allocation priorities and how we plan to fund all the growth that we see going forward. Now following each one of the segments, have your questions ready because we'll take some questions from the audience to give you a chance to dig in a little bit more on each one of the business units right after that. So with that, let's start with how we see the fundamentals continuing to support all of our businesses on a go- forward basis. And then I'll highlight how the synergistic and nature of the business and its resilience of the assets really does allow us to have strong competitive advantages. I'll conclude by continuing to outline that disciplined capital allocation approach that we have that really underpins that attractive growth outlook and supports our First Choice Investment thesis. And then I'll look forward to taking a few questions from all of you before I invite Colin up on the stage and start our business discussions. So let me start with fundamentals. Strong fundamentals continue to support our business model. I think there is a growing realization that all sources of energy will be needed to meet both the growing energy demand as well as economic expansion, which is expected actually to rise for decades to come. And this increase in demand for energy is fueled by population growth, by economic growth, and that requires energy that is reliable and of course, that's affordable. Natural gas, I don't think there's much, it's going to continue to be essential in meeting this demand for building the middle class globally. And the importance of natural gas in itself cannot be overstated. It heats our homes. It keeps the lights going. And it's really hard to see a future from our perspective, at least one that's positive for humans where the foundational fuel going forward is not natural gas. Of course, oil is going to continue to play a really big role here, both in terms of fueling conventional commercial transportation and of course, as a feedstock for the petrochemical industry. Sometimes we, as North Americans, I think we often forget for a lot of global markets that are out there, oil is, in fact, part of their own energy transition goals as they work to get off less sustainable and less efficient fuel sources. Now all that said, renewables is going to continue to have a really key role and be a key driver in meeting the emission reduction targets that are out there. Investments in new energies, I think, are also going to grow as technology matures and becomes more commercially viable. And as those projects materialize, we are particularly excited about their role in potentially extending the useful lives of our conventional assets. In fact, people forget for some policy makers, investments in pipelines and conventional fuel infrastructure today is actually seen as investment in a prebuild for what might be one day at hydrogen-fueled economy. Now North America is ideally positioned to meet the growing energy demands. We have some of the most competitive and obviously, sustainable energy in the world that's going to play an important element in helping countries and communities actually realize their emission targets as well. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

I think it's important to note that Enbridge itself and our view of the pace of energy transition has been really consistent for many, many years. And it seems that the consensus is increasingly coming towards and being aligned with our view that we've held for a long time. I think it turns out that following the fundamentals over the long term is probably better for investors than following the bandwagon in the short term. Our footprint really makes us North America's first choice energy provider. We don't just have assets, we actually have franchises in each of the businesses where we're involved. And these franchises meet the needs, the energy needs of hundreds of millions of people and communities right across North America and increasingly beyond North America. Just look at this map. That position cannot be replicated over any amount of time and probably just about for any amount of money. We don't take that for granted at Enbridge, but we do use it as a competitive advantage each and every day as we deal with our customers and obviously against our competitors. These franchises, indeed, they're irreplaceable. But equally important, each one of these franchises provide steady growth and has a robust set of growth opportunities. And in the years to come, I expect you will start to see us use and increasingly realize both operational and commercial leveraging opportunities right across in between these franchises. This scale and diversification appropriately commands a premium valuation. Our portfolio after all generates highly predictable cash flows that allow us to have a business composition that mirrors the global energy mix. Today, and it's structured to adapt alongside energy transition tomorrow, not well ahead of it, not behind it, but right in line with their energy transition where it's going, and it's our belief that's where real value creation is actually made. So we remain committed to this diversified portfolio. And post the gas acquisitions, our business mix will be balanced between the liquids and the gas with the growing renewables energy kicker. The scale provides a series of irrefutable advantages. From a customer perspective, we have deep relationships and expansive full path market access that really allows us to offer a differentiated approach to our customer engagement. And from a competitive perspective, our cross-business franchises allow us to execute both conventional and lower carbon projects with a lower cost of capital. The proof points on this slide, I think, really speaks to these issues, whether it's our strategic utility acquisitions, whether it's self-powering, on our liquids pipelines or with the development of our Western Canadian natural gas supersystem or in fact, the blue ammonia project at Ingleside down in Corpus. They would not be possible without an integrated or benefit from a large portfolio that's diversified that we have. All of this creates optionality for our customers to meet their energy and growth needs through an Enbridge franchise. Let me say this maybe a little bit different way. If you think about interconnectivity and that interconnectivity between our businesses and how it's a key competitive differentiator that will allow us to maintain a leading position as North America's first choice energy provider. I think this example, and these examples will show you that. Take three of the key North America energy regions. So you take Texas, take Ontario, take Ohio. We have an extensive asset footprint in each one of these jurisdictions. We own pipelines in each one of these and 2 out of 3 of them we own utilities. And in all 3, we have renewable power facilities that really gives us a unique local market expertise and the ability to cross-sell services to our customers. This, coupled with our strong stakeholder relations, really helps us, I think, to better understand how to generate and deliver value for our customers and, of course, for our investors as well. So the asset base overlap and the deep understanding of our customers is going to continue to allow us to generate growth opportunities at attractive returns that blend and extend our growth right through the end of the decade. Now even with that exciting opportunity set, I think it's important to state that our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will maintain that financial flexibility to grow the business and, of course, return capital to 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

our shareholders. The balance sheet is going to remain a top priority, as is our commitment to invest within our targeted leverage range. And investors can see that through already. We've been doing that through our significant progress on financing the U.S. gas utility acquisitions that we picked up last September. Of course, we're going to continue to return capital to shareholders in line with our low-risk cash flow profile and that disciplined DCF payout range of 60% to 70%. We've got a strong track record of returning capital to investors. In the last 5 years alone, we have returned $34 billion to shareholders. And we're forecasted over the next 5 years to return an additional $40 billion of dividends over that 5-year period. Lastly, we'll continue to blend and extend our utility-like growth by prioritizing capital- efficient expansions and highly selective tuck-in asset M&As. You saw a little bit of that this morning. And this allows us to confidently target an annual TSR of 10% to 12%, driven by our well supported dividend and predictable growth outlook. That predictable growth outlook continues through a focus on surfacing shareholder value through deploying capital efficiently. So over the near term, the priority is realizing attractive returns through efficient expansions and organic growth. Our vast energy delivery franchise provides us with opportunities to extend our offerings, increase utilization and optimize the base. And then our $25 billion of secured capital program really provides a multiyear runway with build multiples that really drive value creation. Of course, we're going to maintain a keen watch on the market and opportunistically transact asset level -- at the asset level, when those transactions extend our value chain, extend the footprint and enhance the shareholder growth metrics and the balance sheet strength. To sum it up, we cannot be more confident in our belief that Enbridge is truly a First Choice investment opportunity. Continuous execution of our strategic priorities, a prudent capital allocation philosophy and an unparalleled low-risk cash flow profile has translated into industry-leading TSRs of a little bit over 11% over the last 20 years. And as you're going to hear today, our low-risk business model and discipline allows us to consistently achieve our financial guidance and deliver dividend growth while executing our highly visible growth pipeline. And our growth contains low carbon optionality in each of the businesses. This enhances our outlook and can be geared to the differing pace of energy transition, not just globally, but in each of the jurisdictions of which we operate. So we're confident in this confluence of opportunity, our record of execution and the highly reliable low-risk cash flow setup as it continues, and we expect it to continue double- digit shareholder returns right through the end of the decade and into the next. Again, I want to thank everybody for being here. And I expect that you're going to enjoy the next several hours. And before I ask Colin to come up on stage, let's take a few minutes to answer some questions. Theresa Chen Theresa Chen from Barclays. The bullet you had about the evolving business mix taking into account energy transition. As we think about the next medium term, let's call it next 5 years for the company, can you talk about how you envision the segment to change? And when we think about organic versus inorganic dollars deployed towards growth, is 2023 a reasonable template for the path forward? Gregory Ebel Well, so that's probably the #1 question I get from Board members and investors. And so that pie chart, everybody wants to know what it's going to look like 10 years from now. I'm not convinced it's going to look 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 4/36

dramatically different. And here's the reason. First of all, the liquids business is very large, even at half. So a little over $9 billion in EBITDA. I think the renewables business, the smaller business today, which is growing rapidly. They basically have to add $15 of EBITDA just to stay flat with where they are in the entity. That's pretty tough to do, I know you'll hear Matthew, I know that he'll try to do that, but I don't see a dramatic change on that side. I do think an increased amount of organic growth is going to go into the gas business. We've got some $18 billion of growth in that regard. But then to your last part of the question, is last year typical? I don't think it's typical because we're not going to have USD 14 billion or CAD 19 billion, CAD 20 billion of acquisitions every year. I see us much more doing the kind of things we did today with the small asset tuck-ins. It already has a little bit of EBITDA in it that really extend our competitive business. And then as you think about new energy technology stuff, really small. Theresa like I think that's still a long ways to go, and it will be embedded in part of the business. So Colin's got CCUS inside that business. And Cynthia could point to RNG and hydrogen. So I think those will be more part of the business. But if you look at 10 years, yes, liquids will be less than 50%, I think, of the overall pie, but I don't see that being dramatically different, right? Just given its size and the inability to kind of have the other business grow at basically twice the rate to be able to overtake every dollar increase that's coming out of oil, which is a lot. I mean we're continuing to grow those earnings at very low multiple opportunities, and you're going to hear that from Colin. Robert Catellier Rob Catellier, CIBC, 2 quick questions for you, Greg. If I have the numbers right, I think you've indicated $9 billion of investment capacity now. It seems like you're sticking to the $6 billion to $7 billion in terms of your planning what you might spend. So I got 2 related questions to that. One, how should we view the gap between your capacity and what you're planning to spend, specifically should we look at that gap as a bit of a war chest for M&A? And just how do you view larger scale M&A going forward? Gregory Ebel Well, here's the way I think about that. I mean I look at that gap as opportunity, but the opportunity has got to solve several issues, right? It's got to extend the footprint and the businesses that we're in now. It's got to be accretive to our shareholder metrics, and it's got to be neutral or accretive to the balance sheet. So yes, it's M&A is something we look at in both sides of that, right, both in buying and also in terms of selling. As you know, we've probably recycled $18 billion, $19 billion over the last several years. So yes, M&A, if necessary, but not necessarily M&A. If we don't need to use that balance sheet, we won't. I mean we purposely showed that on there. We've got more capacity than I think some people realize, but that doesn't mean that we're going to use it because the opportunity set, and I think you're going to hear from people today in our businesses is really hard to beat. I mean you've got to have really nice economics and strategic nature of that to use any of that balance sheet for anything other than organic growth. Robert Catellier Second question for me just has to do with the payout ratio. Now that you have a bigger proportion of your business will be on a pro forma basis coming from the utilities business. And given the amortizing nature of that rate base, how have you changed your perspective on how you account for maintenance capital or how you treat the dividend payout ratio? 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 5/36

Page 6
Gregory Ebel Yes. So we're still a mix, right? So I think if you think about us being utility-like, it still only 25% utility, Robert, I would say we look at all those metrics. We look at it on a per share basis or an EPS basis. You got to look at it at a cash basis. I mean you think about the massive cash generation that's being achieved out of the liquids business. I think sticking to one metric or another, doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but we look at those. Right now, I would say that DCF type payout is exactly the right mix for where the business is. As I said, I don't expect the mix to change dramatically. And that 60% to 70% range, I think, is the sweet spot much like the balance sheet. And again, I think you'll hear from Pat on that as well. I think we've got time for one more, and then we're going to go to the business units. I promise you there's going to be lots of time for questions. Linda Ezergailis Linda Ezergailis, TD Cowen. The way you lay out the future makes energy transition seem easy. But we all know that execution might bring its challenges. And when you layer on potential for disruption, whether it's geopolitical changes that you need to pivot to or disruptive technologies like AI, I do wonder if there's some execution risk related to having the right talent in the building. So can you comment on any sort of demographic age issues you might have within your organization, how you think of developing the right talent, hiring and retaining the right talent and whether you think you have the talent that you need right now to face all that change? Gregory Ebel It's a good question, and we're constantly looking at that. The Board is constantly looking at it, making sure it's not so much just at the CEO level and the executive level, but several rows down. That is part of an ongoing approach by the Board. Even I won't say mentoring, but actually even connecting Board members with parts of our organization that we haven't done before. That's one. Two, and this is an unfortunate but positive part, the old creative destruction thing. Look, we have done some layoffs, but we're also refocusing and hiring people inside the corporation as well. So I think we're trying to say, as I said, not too far ahead, not too far behind with the energy transition and making sure we've got the right resources. But we have a great distribution. 30% of our people are actually new to the company in the last 5 years. I think that's incredibly positive. Now we have lots of folks that have been 20 or 30 years, and they bring the knowledge of those cycles, not to get too worked up one way or another. Remember, everybody under the age of 40 really hasn't experienced a recession, definitely hasn't seen high interest rates and having a management team with that skill set, matched up with the folks that are thinking about the next generation of energy dynamics, I think is a perfect mix. So yes, always looking for good talent, but I think we have an unbelievably deep bench of talent inside Enbridge today. It's one of the benefits of that large portfolio. All right. Let's look at a video on oil, while Colin comes up on stage and joins me. [Presentation] 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 6/36

Gregory Ebel I love that video, Colin, and seeing people out there, and I know some of the analysts had an opportunity to come down to Ingleside, that last picture there in the ship. We didn't have any analysts driving the big ship, but I think some of them try to move that tug around a little bit. So Listen, for a long time, you guys have really done a great job of expanding the business and the opportunities through things like the mainline tolling agreement and reducing that risk so talk to us a little bit about how we're positioned today and how we think we're set up to keep finding ways to grow in the liquids pipelines. Colin Gruending Yes. Thanks, Greg. Great to be here. Great to see you so many familiar faces. Listen, our liquids pipeline system is set up really well. And maybe just to back up a second on to the fundamentals underpinning it, you talked about it tomorrow is on for oil, especially in North America. North America is now long oil, like you can't say that too many countries or in too many time periods. And so our network here, you can see it on the map, is right on top of this, right? Like if you were starting this from scratch, you would build this, right? In North America, resilient demand, all the basins, 80 refineries pulling on this oil, it's something to behold and I think we're going to have a lot of -- we're going to surprise on the upside. I think we're going to take the challenge on that 50% and tempt you with some great opportunities. And you talked about franchises. I think if you -- I see within liquids itself, 5 or 6 franchises, right? I don't know if you think about it the same way, but we've got a heavy oil business out of Canada, a light oil business out of Canada, an NGL import business into Canada. We've got a light business out of the Bakken, a light business in the Permian and an emerging low carbon footprint across the whole basin. So I think many franchises within one. And arguably, I think together, this is the best midstream franchise in midstream. Gregory Ebel Yes, without a doubt. So going forward, with the utility acquisitions and stuff, LP is going to be about half our EBITDA so call it, $9 billion, although you guys constantly seems a surprise on the upside and challenge accepted given, let's do that again this year. I like that. But you found ways to continue to build great value in cash flow. So remind us how that is and why that is and how you're going to be able to keep that value creation going. Colin Gruending Sure. So I think about the value creation recipe, maybe not different from Enbridge's but within Liquids, if I could double-click on it. First of all, a deep appreciation and participation in the fundamentals of the business. And those of you who followed LP for a while, you'll remember Spearhead, Line 9 rereversed, Clipper, upsizing at the [indiscernible], twinning it like kind of before the herd exports now. So all over the fundamentals, you talked about that, we follow that very closely. Second, the way we've chosen to set up our relationship and business model with customers, okay? We try to align ourselves with customers. The mainline incentives have been going on for 28 years. I think that's unique. And we also maybe within the customer bucket, we don't tend to aggressively compete with our customer with an aggressive marketing affiliate. So I think that's unique in the value creation recipe. Capital allocation discipline, tight commercial arrangements, contracts or we don't have contracts, a floor. You don't hear the word fee-based 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

revenues around LP, which is important. And then a couple -- the people, we talked about people or a question on people. We have the best team in Liquids. It's highly committed, many from multi-generations, a lot of passion for the business. And then finally, socially, I think our interaction with communities, landowners, Indigenous communities, I think we've improved that and are committed to that. So that's kind of the recipe as I see it, and it's allowed us to create value, generate circa 11% ROCEs, which I think is pretty attractive within the Enbridge family. That translates to $9 billion and change of EBITDA ratably per year which in turn translates call it, circa $1 billion in change of investment. You got $8 billion of free cash flow per year. That is a free cash flow machine. And I know Pat's got lots of uses for that. But the first use of that will be conventional reinvestment in the business and in our low carbon footprint. And then pay substantially the dividend and averages up the credit metrics. There's a lot of great uses for it, and there'll be cash flow there for the rest of the business to deploy it as well. Gregory Ebel Yes, absolutely. And as you said, it's really been intentional the way in which you guys have done this over the years, probably nothing more intentional than the work over the last few years on getting the mainline toll settlement, which I know we got approved earlier this week and a lot of work in doing that to ensure we continue those earnings and cash flow. But tell us about that strengthened position now that we've got the mainline tolling agreement in place. And really, the position going forward, not just for the main line, but for the Western Canadian sedimentary basin as well. Colin Gruending Yes. I think, first of all, pleased to see the CR approve the deal. The teams have worked on that, collaborate with customers for many years, as you know. And it's a great foundation for the next number of years to continue this alignment model with customers. Thinking about maybe the next question embedded in that is around the utilization of the mainline. And maybe the simplest way to put it is, and you can see on the graph here, we're pretty full. We've been full -- the mainline has been full for its whole life basically 75 years of being full. We've expanded it, I want to make this number up at like 50x, maybe 100x. It's probably countless all the optimizations and things. So we've got a lot of demand pull on the system, as I mentioned, 2 million barrels per day of sole-sourced refiners, another 1 million in downstream. So you can see the stickiness of that. We're reaffirming our 3 million barrels a day of 2024 throughput. That's just down a [ snick ] from 3.1% last year. So I know people have been thinking about TMX and what's that going to do to the mainline. And I think it's kind of a stale concept that the mainline is going to lose a ton of volume, it's not. And we have high conviction in that for a whole bunch of reasons, including the competitors of the system, the demand pull, et cetera, et cetera. So I guess the other element of this, too, is supply growth is surprised. I think you're asking about that? The 3 years ended 2025, this is from S&P. They see 500,000 barrels per day of supply coming on, and that should exceed the practical egress our use on Trans Mountain. So we should remain pretty full. And I'd draw your attention to like by 2026 here, we think the basin is going to need actually a little more egress. If not just insurance egress, right? The last barrel price is all 5 million barrels. So pretty potent insurance mechanism here. And so in that pink layer there, you can see we're going to try and line up some expansions to create that egress... 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Gregory Ebel And all that kind of leads to 2024 EBITDA growth and continuing on from there, too. So let's talk quickly about that mainline growth in EBITDA stuff. Colin Gruending EBITDA, yes. How does it translate to EBITDA, right? Exactly. So certainly, the throughput we just talked about should help contribute an upward sloping EBITDA profile on the mainline both the base expansion being full or the base volume and then expansion volumes. And then you think about things like returns on capital on the mainline, we've got that caller. We've got some headroom yet in the caller to earn, and I'm pretty confident our team is going to respond to the incentives before it and average up into the top end of the caller. Things like cost management, things like toll inflators that are embedded in the deal. And then rate base will also replenish here through the -- we talked about that earlier, I think, right? The question around dividend sustainability. The mainline rate base is going to replenish as well, integrity management, maintenance. Think about the Line 5 investments that we make fully half of that will come into rate base as it's incurred, not when it goes into service. And then I think the last element of this is the -- a reminder that 30% of the volumes that move through the mainline, I don't participate in the mainline tolling contract. They're full path toll so they average up the average return as well. So EBITDA upward sloping, looks good. Gregory Ebel Yes. And I often think that your idea of stale concept about being full and then the rate base opportunities. And some people often forget that Line 5 piece is an important element of Mainline tolling. But if you think about going kind of the interconnected nature of the Canadian and U.S. systems, both -- and obviously, much more with our assets on the Gulf now. That really provides some operating and commercial leverage for us. So give us your thoughts on what that means for growth opportunities as well? Colin Gruending Yes. I think this -- well, the network it's incumbency, it's optionality, it continues to surprise. The scale is impressive here. And we've listed a number of low multiple expansions we can do on the system. We're visiting this all the time. We've been full, like I say, forever. So the team is constantly looking at ways to efficiently like with efficient use of shareholder capital, provide egress for customers. And just north to south, we're seeing green shoots in the oil sands portfolio. Again, a number of customers publicly disclosed their ambitions where we have operating leverage here to through pumping or DRA pretty efficiently add capacity all the way through Mainline Express, planning in South, you can see them all here. That's all very likely and attainable. There's another bucket of growth we even like better than that, and that's the zero CapEx growth. And we've done a lot of that over time. I think drag-reducing agent basically, OpEx cost savings. So there's a number of ways to grow this business, and we're going to try and attempt to grow in more than half the pie. So I think this all looks good. And then on top of that, the low carbon stuff, that will probably be a little slower, but we've got some margins in the fire there, too. Gregory Ebel 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 9/36

Yes. Well, we can do all the 4 to 6x EBITDA growth you want. So keep bringing those brother because that's good. So if we think about the Gulf Coast, we weren't really in the Permian or the Gulf Coast in a big way, at least on the acreage side just a few years ago, right? Now we're building out that super system. So maybe let's finish up this section and really give us what are the latest opportunities there for business growth on a go-forward basis out of the Gulf? Colin Gruending Yes, we're excited about this. You saw some announcements today. And yes, it's been a few short years in this basin, probably 75 in Canada, 40 in the Bakken, only a few here. We're doing this in an Enbridge way. It's been a crawl, walk, run approach. We're probably in the stride and walk pace right now. We're excited about this. There's a lot to like here. We're doing it in a contracted kind of Enbridge way again. So you can see the puzzle kind of coming together with the companion Gray Oak expansion, more terminaling at storage at Ingleside. And then the docks next door now, which are need twist and provide, again, a lot of optionality and promise to that whole investment. I mean we think about Ingleside as -- there's lots of metaphors for this. I mean the Catcher is sitting at the bottom of Texas there, lots of export to happen or the Swiss Army Knife. Like our vision here, we have a lot of ambition here. The vision really is to create a multi-product export terminal at Corpus. And all the reasons that make it so advantaged for crude apply to other products, including blue ammonia, including NGL. So hence, some of the logic behind today's announcement so we're very excited about it. Gregory Ebel Yes. No, it's great stuff, whether it's catching mitt or whatever, just keep putting the puck in the tough corner, and we'll be happy with that. So thanks very much, Colin. Tons of activity going on in the liquid side and great growth. Let's open it up for some questions for Colin. We got some right there that. Praneeth Satish Praneeth, Wells Fargo. I guess as you look at the Gray Oak expansion, I think there's 2 other pipelines that are headed to Corpus that are in the process of either contracting or expanding capacity. So maybe if you could just talk about competitively where Gray Oak stands relative to those? And then broadly speaking, is it mostly kind of taking volumes maybe from some pipes that are headed to Houston where you can secure that supply for your pipe? Or do you think the basin is growing fast enough to kind of fill up these expansions? Colin Gruending Yes. So the growth pipeline is very competitive with the other pipes. We own 30% of one of the other ones Cactus II as well. So I think there's enough volume there to float all boats, pardon the pun, but the supply outlook looks good. We're at 6 million a day on our way to 7 million, 7.5 million. So we're trying to time this open season to kind of fit with that. The pipes of Corpus are pretty much full today. We're loading 1 million barrels off the dock at Corpus. And so I don't think we're necessarily stealing volumes from Houston. I think it's new volumes is how we see it. As a reminder, Gray Oak actually goes to both, right? We can move over to Houston as well, which there's 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

some optionality there longer term as well. So yes, we like Gray Oak, we like the whole setup and it's super system. It works. Gregory Ebel Well, and as you said about Western Canada, Western Canada growing at least 500,000 barrels. It sure seems like now through the end of the decade. The Permian is a couple of million barrels, right? So and that's partially behind the Ingleside the FHR acquisition today too, right? You'll be able to optimize inputting Aframax and Suezmax on the smaller docks, keep the VLCCs full. That's a winner all day long as well. Patrick Kenny Pat Kenny, National Bank. Just on the Mainline settlement running through 2028, which in pipeline years is really just right around the corner. How do you think about marrying up the 2026 potential expansions with also trying to extend the contracted duration of your tolling agreements with shippers? Colin Gruending Yes, you're right, it's around the corner, and we'll begin thinking about that in a couple of years. So what's worked historically, like I said, we've expanded the mainline many times through many vintages of [indiscernible] agreements. And so it works typically best as -- we'll add a surcharge, right? Nickel or Dime to the $5 a toll, and it will have a -- it will kind of get stapled on and then maybe rolled in or preserved in the next vintage. That seems to work. It's relatively cheap insurance, right, to preserve the net back on the other 5 million barrels in the base. So that's typically how it works. Benjamin Pham Ben Pham, BMO Capital Markets. This question maybe for you, Greg, too, as well. I'm just thinking about the $8 billion of free cash flow probably underappreciated by the market and there's probably more leverage you can think about that piece of it. What are your thoughts around influencings around spin-out with liquids, whether it's full spinout or partial spinout? Just maybe unlock some of that free cash flow underappreciation. Colin Gruending Yes. I would -- look, I think if you look at the entire portfolio, I think -- as I said before, we've got a huge -- we have 4 separate franchises, and they increasingly work together. So look, I think it's -- there's some more communication we've got to do about making people realize that $8 billion. I think interest rates have a little bit of a factor maybe why that's not appreciated to a full extent. But it really works as a virtuous circle from the cash that's being generated today in the liquids business, but let's remember just a few years ago, we were building out the mainline, right? And that was costing a lot of money. And then we can utilize cash in the other business as they grow, each one of the businesses, I think, can feed off each other at different points in the cycle. At this point in time, we see lots of generation of cash out of the liquids business, somewhere down the road. Maybe they'll have a big expansion. And one of the other businesses won't be able to grow as much. So I think that virtuous circle and keeping that portfolio together really creates a premium valuation, and we've seen that 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

play out over time. So don't really see us going down that path. Now we look at it all the time, right, if there was some massive value disconnect between the businesses, I think that's something you'd have to look at. Rebecca Morley Diana Glassman with EOS Federated Hermes. With regard to permitting of liquids expansions, but any infrastructure expansions in Canada and the States, I guess, outside the red states outside Texas and supportive states. How do you, the Board, how should we think about potential risks of lack of permitting delays, route changes, all those sorts of things related to community Indigenous opposition to capacity expansion, either based on climate or environmental or social disturbance and those sorts of factors. I mean, is there sort of a probability assessment that you think of? Gregory Ebel Absolutely. Look, we -- even on our capital allocation, we look at, it's a business more risky or less risky, do we have to apply some type of carbon kicker on top of the capital. So that goes on through the process. I think the #1 thing to do to manage that risk is having a geographically diverse set of assets that you can deal with because at different times in different locations, you're going to have governments of all stripes. We're in 43 states. We're in 8 provinces. We're in 5 countries. That in itself creates some risk management opportunities, right? So rarely will you see us building out $10 billion, $12 billion, $30 billion, if you look at some of the Canadian examples of a single asset, and therefore, putting all your risk in one jurisdiction with one set of stakeholders. If you look across our business, you know that $25 billion worth of projects, nothing is more than, say, $5 billion or $6 billion, and most of them are $1 billion or less in terms of projects. So I think it's making sure you've got a diversified focus on those risks and dealing with that. And then the other side is we have an unbelievable stakeholder relations group, always looking how do we take this to the next stage. And that's all about being on the ground. And again, we've got people in all the states in which we operate. We've got people in all the countries in which we operate. And even turn to Ohio, and we'll talk about Ohio, I'm sure, a little bit with Michele. That's more of a purple state, if you will. And as long as you've got great assets, you get great people in there and customer needs, you can work through the regulatory environment. So again, I think that's the power of having a large portfolio going back to your comment on that issue. Colin Gruending Just later on a reminder about our indigenous reconciliation action plan. I think it's forward-thinking it's aggressive. It's effective. I think we've got some great success stories there. The Line 3 built, right, a $10 billion project went very, very well overall. And certainly, in Canada, a lot of involvement with local communities, a lot of say, a lot of tribal surveying, very inclusive approach. And I think that's a big part of the plan going forward as well. Gregory Ebel Yes. Now that being said, it does take time to get things done. But it's another benefit of having quick cycle capital opportunities, too. So if you think about our distribution business, virtually all that capital turns into 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

EBITDA within a 12-month period. You can't say that about major pipeline build, right? They just take time to get done. Look, I think we're going to wrap up here on liquids. And thank you, Colin. Going to show you a little video on the gas business as Cynthia comes up, and we'll talk about transmission. [Presentation] Gregory Ebel Welcome, Cynthia, great video as well in the gas business, and really tells us a lot about the assets that we have and the exciting things going on and for natural gas overall. So maybe for the group here, outline just exactly how the business is situated today and where you see the growth opportunities coming up. Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks, Greg. It is great to be here. Now as you've said, natural gas is essential for energy, security and affordability and we're going to need it for decades to come. So as you can see on the slide here, the numbers, our scale is unparalleled. We have strategic integrated assets and a footprint that ties to key supply basins and key demand markets. We deliver affordable energy to over 170 million people across North America. We're supporting the U.S. Gulf Coast LNG exports. And soon, we're going to be connected to LNG exports off the BC Coast. We generate about $4.7 billion of utility-like cash flows and we're growing. And that growth has 3 drivers: low cost optimizations, serving domestic markets, and supporting LNG exports. And we're also expanding our lower carbon initiatives, helping our customers meet their emissions targets while still following our low-risk commercial model. Gregory Ebel So let's dig into that one area of growth that you were talking about, which was really around the growth in the base business. And you and the team have worked those assets extremely hard and keep finding ways to optimize them and find new ways to generate growth. So maybe talk about that base optimization piece. Cynthia Hansen Yes, that's right, Greg. Our assets with their connections to those demand pull markets, we see really high long- term utilization. In fact, our average contract length is 10 years, and that just shows how critical those assets are. And over the last several years, with recontracting, we've added about $100 million of EBITDA. And this year, again, our pipes are 100% contracted. So that means we're going to continue to add EBITDA. Another successful strategy that we're following for growth is our rate settlement approach. And through that, we've added $500 million of EBITDA since 2020. A modernization of our system is also a very important part of how we're doing -- driving growth, increasing our reliability and lowering emissions. And that's also part of that overall settlement strategy. Gregory Ebel 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 13/36

Page 14
Yes. The optimizations are huge. The 100% recontracting that's been going on for years, pretty incredible. A lot of discussion about LNG these days regardless of your views and where you're going to go on pauses and things like that. But GTM is already set up to really add a lot of value and growth opportunities through LNG. So maybe lay out for the audience, the different ways that you see that happening in, say, a location like British Columbia. Cynthia Hansen So as you can see on the slide, that last mile connectivity for our customers really gives us a strong competitive position, and we're generating great returns. And we see about $5 billion of pipeline opportunities. We also have these great storage assets that really enhance our competitive position. We added 112 Bcf of net storage last year. So we have about 10% of storage across North America. And that really allows us to do these low-cost expansions, where and when it makes sense to do so. Now in Western Canada, that abundant low-cost Canadian natural gas supply has really helped that build-out of the LNG on the West Coast. And that in that particular space in BC, we have a truly competitive system, a super system like we've been talking about. And that West Coast LNG build-out is being supported by that continual development of new supply. It's estimated there will be another 4.5 Bcf of supply by 2050. To date, as shown on the slide, we've secured $5.2 billion with a pipeline growth. And we've been able to do that because of our relationships with Indigenous communities, and we're going to continue to really work with our partners in that space. Now our BC assets are rate regulated. So we do have some cost inflation protection. So that differentiates us from some of the other large projects that have recently been completed there. Our Aitken Creek storage acquisition that we did last year was very strategic, and that comes with permitted expansion potential. And then, of course, our 30% preferred equity interest in Woodfibre was just a great fit for Enbridge. The financial terms, they made sense. We have this high-quality offtaker. We have strong returns with minimal commodity exposure. And then we have Woodfibre will be the lowest carbon emitting LNG facility in the world because they have that access to hydropower. It also ties into our complete value chain in BC, and we're going to look for opportunities like this, but we'll be selective with future LNG investments. Gregory Ebel Yes, it's really starting to come together in BC, at least for a couple of projects. And you got to love it is a challenging jurisdiction back to your question. And you got to love cost of service and jurisdictions like that, but a big need for gas. So that's great on Western Canada. But what about the opportunity on the Gulf Coast? I mean, it's at least as good, if not even better right there Cynthia, right? So thinking about that in our competitive position, why don't you lay out for the group here about the growth prospects in that area. Cynthia Hansen As you said, our U.S. Gulf Coast assets, they're great. They're super competitive. We have that connection, the key supply and demand markets. our incumbent position is strategically connected to the growing LNG market. That footprint allows us to do very capital-efficient expansions and connections. And we're also tied to that base load energy industrial demand. We see about $9 billion of opportunities in this space in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Right now, we serve between our existing capacity and the projects that are post FID, that will be 7 Bcf per day, and we're in discussions for another 4 Bcf. So the other thing that we're excited about is our announce Sparta project. So 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 14/36

Page 15
that's about $0.2 billion in offshore development. Again, utility-like earnings that are backed by strong counterparties. Gregory Ebel Yes, and that kind of follows on the Vito one that you had as well. Yes, the LNG on the Gulf Coast, I think we're up to about 25% in that range of what we're supporting. And the storage facilities are going to kick in. I also like the commercial leveraging opportunity here. So when you think about our blue ammonia project, I have no doubt that Texas Eastern will provide the gas for that. So you're hearing that Colin? So we got to make sure we get Texas Eastern in on that project as well. If we went forward and gave some thought to what the team did late last year on the RNG front, that's a little bit new for us, although we've been doing it off and on in different places. So give us some of the financial and strategic benefits and how you're thinking about RNG adding to utility-like growth over the long term. Cynthia Hansen RNG is a really promising market, and we see significant growth runway. U.S. RNG demand is expected to grow by double digits by 2040, and that's based on transportation and utility blending demand. Our acquisition of these more renewable assets, the landfill RNG, that gives us these high-quality portfolio assets we are going to grow at about 3% with minimal CapEx. Those assets are going to generate strong returns that are low risk, utility- like cash flows and they're backed by long-term fixed price offtakes with investment-grade counterparties. So that's just right in line with our capital allocation priorities. So these assets are just going to be a great springboard for us to continue to invest in this space. Gregory Ebel Yes. And I love the counterparties, right? Shell, BP, they love the commodity exposure. We don't want it. We lay it off. We get the utility like set up there as well. Well, I think it's pretty clear if anybody asked what's GTM done for us lately, it's a lot and you got $18 billion of growth to go. So let's open it up for some questions for Cynthia. There's a couple right at the back. The management team always says a little bit, how many questions are we going to get in each area? I don't think we were disappointed on the first one, Mainline tolling? Must have been #1, right, or maybe just #2 but... John Mackay John Mackay, Goldman Sachs. Maybe just starting on the LNG strategy. Obviously, the storage side has been a big part of this. We've seen the market actually kind of slow to develop, right? We need a lot more storage and the market really hasn't gone there to pay for it. So just to be curious, you talked about most of your expansion capacity is up in BC. But on the Gulf Coast, what do you need to see to see kind of more greenfield development of storage? Where are some storage expansion opportunities? And how do you see that market developing? Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks, John. We do have some expansions that we're doing at [indiscernible], right? So that's underway. Our expansion there is underway and will come on stream this year. We'll also need to just have like we always 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 15/36

Page 16
want, that utility-like cash flow, that commitment. We see a lot of green shoots in the market. So when we've been recontracting our storage for the last year, we've been recontracting at rates that are 100% to 150% higher than what we've traditionally seen. Great indication that there is that. As Greg said, with some of the temperature differentials and opportunities with LNG, there is that demand. So we're seeing that build out. But we only capital allocation priorities and discipline. We're going to need to see that commitment before we're going to significantly invest. But we are having lots of great conversations with our customers about those opportunities. Gregory Ebel Yes. We don't see anything today, John, but I think that's one of those areas we can keep our eye open for asset- level deals that it may be better actually to pick up an asset and then we're getting a bigger piece of the pie that as Cynthia says, we're seeing contract numbers look much better than they've done for the last 5 or 6 years. You're right. It's been a long time coming, but I think the thesis of playing out, right? That LNG creates big swings. If one of the LNG facilities go down and think about with Freeport, that set storage rates really going unique. So yes, I think the setup there is happening really nice. And I know Cynthia and Allen, they're always looking at stuff. So again, if it's credit, at least neutral, if not accretive, and it's got an opportunity to -- that it's accretive to the per share metrics, that will be a good opportunity for us to look at them. Keith Stanley Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Could you touch a little more on the rate case strategy for the next few years? And when you look at the opportunity set, you highlighted $500 million of EBITDA growth over the past 4 years? Do you see a similar opportunity set for growth from rate case filings as you look forward, just given some of the modernization spend that you've done? Cynthia Hansen Yes. Thanks, Keith. So our strategy is to ensure that we're getting a return, the right return for the assets as we continue to invest in them. Now the modernization that we're doing is needed. It's a critical part of our business. We plan for that. As we look at on our biggest settlement, Texas Eastern, we have a comeback this year. So we're looking at what's the right time. We'll look at with our customers in having those conversations, we know what our capital spend profile is like with things like modernization and how are we going to be able to time that so that we'll drive the best value. So we're going to keep doing that and looking at that. So yes, I think the quick answer is, we're always going to optimize what kind of return we're going to get through the investment we've made in these assets. Gregory Ebel Other questions? You know, Linda, you asked a question on the last earnings call about the Chevron doctrine. And we said we'd come back to you and give that some thought and think about it so Cynthia. I know we've had some discussion on that. Why don't we talk about that for a minute? Cynthia Hansen 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 16/36

Page 17
Right. So Chevron doctrine is basically how the courts in the past have relied on some of the federal agencies, the expertise there at the highest level when there hasn't been clarity. So there's still more to come. We haven't gotten the decisions back. But what we know is that we're able with our expertise to work within the existing regulatory regime. So if there are these kinds of changes, we will adapt. I'm not concerned about it. We haven't identified any specific issues. What we really want is the regulatory certainty. So the sooner decisions get made, the sooner we can go forward. We don't see any particular concerns. We work with these regulatory agencies, whether it's on air quality, water quality or safety. So we'll find a path through it. Gregory Ebel Yes. We're sure not -- there's nothing unique to Enbridge about that issue, right, or even the energy sector, anybody who's a regulated player, I think it creates a little bit of uncertainty. But it's the Supreme Court of the United States. We know exactly what they're going to do. Zackery Van Everen Zack Van Everen from TPH. I guess I'll be the one to ask the data center question. Have you guys started to see increased demand on the gas pipelines from customers sourcing data centers in the next 2 or 3 years? And any kind of guess on the size whether it's Bcf or smaller projects here and there? Gregory Ebel Early days, I think still -- here's what I will say. And Matthew will probably -- this was one of the ones we wondered who would raise it first so you get a little bonus for that. Here's what I will say. If you think about some of the jurisdictions we're in, places like Ohio and Texas are really well set up for data centers. As I mentioned in my opening comments, from an Ohio perspective, we obviously have gas pipelines there, we will have a distribution business there and we have a renewable business there. And all those are really attractive to data centers, huge energy sucks, obviously. I guess I shouldn't call them that, huge energy users, but also big players from wanting to get some of that energy on the renewable side. So yes, I would expect I'm not convinced you'll see it at a big pickup on the gas pipeline side. But you could see it on some of our contracting on the power side, and maybe we can chat about that when Matthew comes up. Yes sir, Robert? Robert Catellier And Cynthia, you talked about trying to get the right return on assets. And you've got a pretty big investment in the West Coast Energy system. A pretty low ROE and equity thickness as part of that settlement. So as you just think about what you're investing dollars into the U.S. system, how do you think about trying to improve the returns there? Or is there at some point you need to go back to customers and if there's any expansion, you'd either do something outside of the rate-regulated side of things. Cynthia Hansen Right. Thanks for the question. we're always evaluating that. So this is part of that rate settlement strategy. We have those conversations, and we're looking at the timing of when we go back and have those settlement conversations and that comes into that. So it's how much have we invested, how much have we spent on 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 18
modernization? What kind of expansions have we done? As we look at that, we look at all of those factors and time that out. So that's just part of regular everyday conversations with our shippers. Now as we have connecting infrastructure that ties in, of course, those are more one-on-one conversations as we do open seasons are successful there with enough interest, and we're able to optimize what that return is for an incremental type of assets that we'll add in. But that's just how we run our business. It's part of what we do, and we're always going to look at driving the best value working with our customers though, and really meeting their needs at the same time. Gregory Ebel Yes, I would just add on to, again, very cost of service, very low risk, very utility like. So you're right, it's got less equity thickness. But the return in British Columbia is pretty north of 10%, right? A, B at least recently, there have been soothing words out of British Columbia, I see some of -- one of our big customers and partner there Fortis getting higher equity thickness. So we're at 40% now. We sure aren't afraid to ask, and we're always having discussions with our customers. And let's, we can all -- there's perfect alignment on the following. The producers want to get their product out to markets. The market just look at Sumas pricing across -- gas pricing across relative to other prices in North America and gas. Sumas tells you there's a big need for gas infrastructure, and the local distribution company wants it and obviously, our partner on the LNG front have. So I like the dynamics adding up there to maybe not overnight, better returns, but great dynamics to ensure consistent returns and ultimately supportive regime. Good. I think we will wrap up on the gas transmission side. Thank you, Cynthia, that's great stuff, $18 billion and counting, I love it. And as Michele comes up on stage, let's take a little look at our distribution and storage business. [Presentation] Gregory Ebel Well, thanks, Michele, for being here. I almost feel like I never see you anymore because you run around picking up these assets and doing a great job doing that. So 3 U.S. utilities. That doesn't happen very often that kind of once in a generational opportunity one might say. So by the year-end, we're going to have 4 utilities in the business unit, maybe even a little sooner than that, we'll see. But with that full portfolio of distribution and storage asset, let's talk just a little bit about how you see growth going forward in the business unit. Michele Harradence Oh yes, sure. I mean it's such an exciting time for our business. We're -- I think of it as almost everything is almost doubling. Our asset footprint is changing dramatically with these acquisitions. And when we think of becoming the largest integrated gas utility in North America, we just stop and think of what we can do with that scale in terms of the 4 million customers, things like that. You use the term generational, and it really is for us. What you'll hear from me a lot about this that I like about this deal, though, is the diversification that it adds to the gas distribution and storage business unit. You certainly can see, and Colin and Cynthia just highlighted how they're across North America, how they're in multiple jurisdictions, multiple customers. And that's where we move to now. And that, I think, makes a really big 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

difference and allows us to then spend that $3 billion a year in utility CapEx. It's a significant investment for us, but I really think it reinforces our commitment to maintain and grow industry- leading infrastructure. That said, the most important thing for our 7,000 employees that we're going to have in gas distribution and storage is that we're going to be keeping some 20 million people safe and warm in their homes by delivering reliable, affordable and sustainable energy. Gregory Ebel Yes, as you point out, it really is about long-term investment. There's a lot of discussion about electrification these days. But I think increasingly so the smart money is going towards natural gas is a critical component of the energy landscape. I don't think that's reflected yet in companies like Enbridge or even some of the pure gas utilities. But give us your thoughts on natural gas as a critical fuel and how that really plays into the growth of our gas businesses over the long term and again, with the situation we have now. I think this chart, I always love seeing this, chart, because I really sort of the chart in behind me, I keep looking behind, but the chart in behind me I think it really shows that price advantage that you start from right from the get-go. Michele Harradence Oh yes, 100%. I mean without question, natural gas is the most cost-effective energy source for our customers. That's not changing anytime soon. And I think that, along with the resiliency that natural gas and gas infrastructure provides really play that critical role over the long term. And with that, the key enabler to that reliability and that affordability in our view, is storage and transmission. It reduces price volatility for our customers, just like they talked about it doing for her LNG customers. And it really importantly, it ensures that we can meet the energy needs of our customers 365 days a year in any conditions. So we already have and we'll continue to have a significant storage footprints, both in Ontario and Ohio, some 290 Bcf as you know, in Ontario, Ohio, we'll add another 60 Bcf in Utah. I just love what they've got there, the Wexpro assets, I call it just-in-time storage, as they're pulling it out of the ground and they're working hand in hand with the Utah utility to ensure that reliability and not of price resilience. With North Carolina, they're working on their second LNG facility. That's really important. Utah actually just commissioned their LNG facility. And as you all know, we've been running an LNG facility in Northern Ontario for many, many years to ensure that reliability is there that it adds. So -- and the nice thing about all of that is as you keep everything affordable, that focus on affordability really gives us that room to grow our rate base. while staying cost competitive and making sure we ensure those stable and predictable rates of return. Gregory Ebel Yes. Good old Hagar balancing, LNG grew up not far from there in Sudbury for a lot of my years. But not all gas utilities are actually created equally, right? So we've now -- as you think through the 4 franchises that we've got now or will soon have in who knows maybe the next 36 to 48 hours would be kind of fun, see where we end up, but outline for us that uniquely strong and differentiated position we've got right across jurisdictions? Michele Harradence Yes. I mean I really think of these 4 as a cornerstone of our growth in the gas distribution and storage business. The U.S. utilities, they have higher rates of returns. So that's going to high-grade the portfolio overall. Again, I'm 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

going to say I just love that the avenues of growth are more diversified now. We've talked about investing in storage and transmission. Well, North Carolina and Utah are adding residential customers like crazy as has been Ontario for a long time and we'll continue to. Ohio has a really nice modernization program in place for its infrastructure, short-cycle capital and really across the board with all these utilities, we're helping our customers reduce their emissions, whether that's getting residential customers off of fuel oil or industrial customers like steel manufacturers off of coal. Gregory Ebel Yes. I'm really looking forward to getting all these in the house again, hopefully, we'll have come about here soon. And we've been to see the different governors and regulators and a very positive environment. Of course, we've got a great immature and very solid performing utility in Ontario. It's been doing its thing for the better part of 200 years now, right? But outline where you expect to see growth going forward in that franchise? Some new legislation that's put forward by the Ontario government. So talk to us a bit about that. Michele Harradence Yes. I mean, Ontario, as most know, has a really strong track record of predictable growth. It generates nice steady returns. We continue to expect to grow this business. I mean this is a significant business. We're going to be investing over $1 billion a year in this business just as it goes now. And it has all the differentiated growth that we talked about for the U.S. utilities. So I already mentioned the residential growth, talked about storage and transmission. We're seeing a lot of demand. Ontario is growing as an economy. So we're seeing a lot of demand for system expansion. That's for power generation. That's for greenhouses. You've heard me talk about the greenhouses. We have 4,000 acres of greenhouses in Southwestern Ontario that need the energy that our gas provides actually like the CO2 that it provides as well that helps the plants grow, if you remember your grade 2 science class and that's a huge footprint. Automotive growing as well, battery plants, they use battery manufacturing plants. They need the heat intensity that natural gas provides in their curing process. And of course, there's lots of demand to support those industrial customers like cement manufacturers and steel to reduce their emissions. Well, that said, despite what's really been quite a long-standing commitment by us in 176 years to invest in infrastructure, in Ontario. The Ontario Energy Board did come out in December with -- in our rebasing decision with a decision that's very strongly biased against gas. Well, that had an immediate response from the Ontario government, the OEB's role is to implement these decisions in accordance with government policy and the government doesn't feel that they have. So they've come out and very clearly made some strong statements in support of gas and new legislation, as you've said, that we have an appeal that we've filed, and we would expect that all of that will help support a successful outcome there. Gregory Ebel Yes, you don't often see a government come out within hours, say, on December 22 on a Friday and express their displeasure about that. So the OEB back on track or getting on track with the support of the government. You're on it as you should be, not particularly material for Enbridge, of course, overall. But let's turn to the U.S. utility acquisitions and is the capital efficiency there. And that is an element that we find really attractive, right? And 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

they enhance and increase the visibility of our growth going forward right through the decade. So lay out for investors, how and why that's the case with this asset investment portfolio. Michele Harradence Well, these are just great assets. I think I called you shortly into the due diligence process and said, these are fantastic. We really need to figure out how to make this work. They provide new investment for us, that's capital efficient. It's low risk. It's underpinned by attractive risk-adjusted returns. I mean it just really fits our Enbridge business model well. The CapEx riders, they remove the need for frequent rate base filings. In fact, we start earning on that capital we measured in months, not years in terms of investing that capital. And it's the kind of growth we like. It's the predictable returns, limited capital permitting or inflation risk. And they all have really nice revenue decoupling mechanisms that mitigate earnings volatility that sometimes you'll see with weather as an example. And I mentioned earlier about how it's really important that we ensure that natural gas thing is affordable. That underpins our ability to grow. Well, each of the utilities have really competitive cost to serve. Ohio and North Carolina are certainly the most effective, most competitive cost to serve in their jurisdictions. And Utah has some of the most competitive cost to serve in the country. So we're really looking forward to get them in there. The other thing I would say is, and we saw that in the video, they're in gas supportive jurisdictions where the legislators have said that they will protect and preserve customer choice and energy. So it's coming along really well. We've got all our federal regulatory approvals, and you kind of stole my thunder a little while ago, but... Gregory Ebel I didn't say anything. I'm just saying it'll be nice if 40% of the EBITDA showed up this week. Michele Harradence Yes. So in fact, at about 1:30 PM this afternoon, it's on the Ohio PUCs docket, and we expect a positive decision there. I'm flying down to Ohio tonight. And as you said, that's 40% of our EBITDA, 1.2 million customers that we expect to come in quickly here. And then Utah is going really well as is Wyoming. So for those of you who enjoy reading PUC filings, you know that we actually filed with the PUC in Utah last week that we believe we reached a settlement with parties there. And the hearing is scheduled for, I think, April 11, with the one Wyoming at the end of May. So things should move along smoothly there. While, we get those two, that's almost 80% of our EBITDA, 2.4 million customers here by summer. So we're quite excited about that. North Carolina is going well. We just -- as we said all along, it just is a bit of a longer process, and we would expect to definitely have that before the end of the year. Gregory Ebel Yes. [indiscernible] experience with that to North Carolina gets to the right spot, but they have a little different process. So look at lots of capital to earnings inside a year. We love that stuff. So great stuff. Can we open it up to questions for Michele? Really, we go invest $14 billion, and no question, come on? Yes, sir. Goldman, John? 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

John Mackay We've seen loan growth in North America start to increase after years of Kind of flatlining. I'd just be curious of your take on whether or not this pickup we're starting to see, and it goes a little bit to the data center question is fine. But just kind of more generally, if you think we can kind of see this beginnings of load growth recovery start to really pick up and if we can reach maybe a general kind of forecast on what that could look like across your 4 jurisdictions. Gregory Ebel I think it's a combo of many things, right? I mean, obviously, electricity demand and energy demand in general kind of runs at 2/3 of GDP growth. To your point, we hadn't quite seen that. I think that's one. I think, 2, renewables are playing a little bigger role but they got to have gas backup. So that requires a little bit more demand. And then let's face it. I mean, not all our gas customers, obviously, our gas producing customers love this. But the price of natural gas is highly competitive, right? So yes, I think we're going to -- let's put it this way, I sure don't think we're going to see what people talked about some decline in the demand for natural gas. I just, that to your comment, it kind of goes against your grade 2 science perspective and how to proceed here. And virtually 100% of the emission reductions in the United States in the last 15 years have been because of the use of natural gas in electricity. So both can be true electricity up, gas use up. I think Duke just filed its integrated resource plan in North Carolina, which we're focusing on more now these days. And I think they're adding -- or they're looking they'd like to add 5,000 megawatts of gas. So yes, I don't think it's unique. And I do think the industrialization or the deindustrialization of some countries, that's really benefiting North America. We see that in Southern Ontario and we obviously will see it in the Great Lakes regions, Ohio, Pennsylvania, all areas where our assets go to. Michele Harradence Yes. I think the piece I would add is the resiliency piece too. We're seeing a lot more of our customers firm up their volumes and that sort of thing, which is nice from a revenues perspective, but doesn't require a ton of CapEx to get there. Unknown Analyst [indiscernible] well. I wonder if you could put some boundaries around your interest in further acquisitions in this space whether there are additional gas LDCs, ever an electric LDC, if you could buy 5 more of these, would you buy 5 more? Or is there limits? Gregory Ebel Well, I think if you saw that jurisdictional map that showed kind of the picture with all the orange places of choice. That's obviously going to be a place where gas is supported. And some of those would have different levels of support. So I think that's one. Two, and go back to the capital allocation issue. Can we make it accretive? This transaction is only slightly accretive, but at a great price. So if we can do that and support it through the balance sheet, that would be of interest to us on the gas utility side. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 23
I think it's an open debate about the electric utility side. My own personal view is that's a much more challenging market with the amount of rate base they have to add. And I don't think they have in many jurisdictions have the same benefit of as much natural gas which is really the cheap -- it's going to be a cheap way to deal with this. So I think electric utilities probably have to work through a fair number of things. But the gas utility allows us to commercially leverage operationally leverage. And when you look at the jurisdictions we now have, that's the kind of thing you'll be looking for. So population growth in a place like Utah, penetration growth in a place like North Carolina and industrial growth, modernization, both in Ontario and Ohio. Those things are kind of attractive. What would you add, Michele? Michele Harradence No, I think you've got it covered. Gregory Ebel Got to be big, too, right? I mean I don't think it's value, we won't, but I don't think it'd be value both for us to add 100,000 customers, somewhere that's outside the main business. Yes, Robert? Robert Catellier Michele, I got a couple of questions just on the U.S. business. So you're showing I think it's a peak in CapEx in 2026. Now utility CapEx normally back dives as you go out. So just -- is there something structural going on in 2026? Or do you expect that to be pretty durable? The second question just being, how are you planning on running multiple utilities here in terms of are you thinking about running them decentralized or are you going to use a shared services model to drive efficiencies, but that can be a very slippery slope as well. Michele Harradence Yes, those are great questions. So first of all, the CapEx peak is tied so much to the LNG facility that they're building in North Carolina. So that's what's pushing it up. The rest of it is pretty steady, much like it is in Ontario. And in terms of how we're looking at running it, I mean, one of the things that was really impressive about these teams, and I think it speaks to what we were able to get to where we have as quickly in Ohio and Utah as we have is the strength of the local teams, the strength of their relationships with the stakeholders, whether that's customers, government, regulators, that sort of thing. So -- and we know this from running our business in Ontario that having strong local teams that are part of the fabric of the community is really important. So the VPs and GMs that currently run those businesses will report directly to me. And then, of course, as Enbridge, we have our corporate services. And then that's exactly the line that we're working our way through with a lot of consultation with the new utilities as well as how we've looked at things in Ontario since we brought together Union Gas and Enbridge Gas is what's the sweet spot for those, I call them the utility services, whether those are technical or commercial. And the example I would give you is a call center. Now maybe folks are spread all over the place, but there's probably a best way to do that and to really understand how we're receiving those calls, but really important, though, as well that each GM understands the nature of the calls that are coming in and gets that feedback so that he or she can adjust as they need to and be responsive to their customers. So that's exactly what we're working our way through. And we've got a lot of experience with shared services with centralized and 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 24
decentralized model. So lots of views, Dominion was quite centralized. So we will likely pull it back a bit more locally than what they have, but trying to hit that sweet spot. Gregory Ebel Yes. And I think Robert also had a question on the capital side of things over the long term so you might want to speak to that. But yes. And maybe it goes without saying, Robert, but this wasn't a deal driven by synergies in any way, shape or form, right? And the old adage about all politics are locals, all regulatory structures are local too, right? So I think it's really powerful to have those teams there. But Rob was just talking about beyond even 2026, but... Michele Harradence Yes. I mean we've talked about how North Carolina, Utah and Ohio -- it's not Ohio, I'm sorry, Ontario, the residential growth is really strong, and they look a lot like Ontario in terms of north of 80% of the revenues come from that residential growth. So that's really the base that we want to grow our systems off of, and that continues to be some of the strongest residential growth in both countries. So that's going to be our steady flowing into the system, the maintainability of the system, newer systems in Utah and North Carolina and even Ontario is somewhat getting to the end of its modernization program, I would say, lots of modernization growth still to go in Ohio, which is a really nice way to see that one continue to grow because it doesn't quite have the residential growth, the population increases that we're seeing elsewhere. But really, it's that -- I call it, the bread and butter investment that we make, that's really steady. And then, of course, as we see bigger projects come through that allow us to invest more capital, we'll do that. And I would actually point to what the Ontario government said in their proposed legislation where they really want to take our transmission projects and have an ability to name them as economic development projects in order to ensure that they get the funding they need and they grow. And I would point, for example, to our PREP project, which is before the OEB now, it's a panhandle which is Southwestern Ontario, that's maybe $350 million for us, but it enables over $4 billion of investment from greenhouse growers from power producers, that sort of thing and over 7,000 jobs. Those are really important to the government of Ontario, just like they want to be at any jurisdiction. So we would expect to keep seeing that supported as well. Gregory Ebel Robert, the other thing I like as a centralized capital allocator, myself linking from the whole corporation. We've created, I think, a positive competitive dynamic where -- and I think it's recognized by the policymakers in each one of those jurisdictions that, in many respects, you could keep putting more and more dollars in these. But now it's like which are the ones that make the most sense from a return perspective and quick cycle and supportive. So I don't think that's lost on different jurisdictions and governments. And from an allocation perspective, it makes it work nice because I don't think there's any doubt you could invest more in Ontario, if you're given the positive environment to do that. And if you're not, we'll do that in Ohio and North Carolina and Utah. So I like that opportunity. Michele Harradence 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 25
Yes, I would say the legislators across the board are very attuned to that. I mean you just need to look at how much money has to go into infrastructure over the next -- the coming decade, whether I think it was Hydro- Quebec announced over $180 billion a couple of weeks ago at the same time as Ontario's announcing a lot other things they want to do. They know they need -- and same thing when we talk to the legislators in the U.S. They know that they need to track that capital but we need to be able to demonstrate that we can invest it in a very sustainable cost-effective manner. Gregory Ebel Well, thanks, Michele. Go get us some more utilities. Let's certainly one down and 2 more to go here quickly, but I appreciate it very much. While we turn to video on power, we're going to have Matthew Akman, come and join me on stage. [Presentation] Gregory Ebel All right. I got to say, Matthew is the cool kid because he gets a club scene in his, the rest of us didn't see that kind of stuff. But Matthew, let's make you sing for your supper a little bit here, great video, I think, that really shows how you're set up and our competitive position on that. So maybe outline for the group and take a minute on how we are poised to capitalize on that position. Matthew Akman Yes, lots to talk about in the renewable power business today. The last few years have been up here talking about how we are gaining a lot of momentum in the business, and you've seen some announcements in the last while on that. And now I'm ready to say we're in lift-off mode, especially in the North American space, we talk about a lot of growth there, but it will be a controlled lift off Enbridge style. We'll have to focus on our investment discipline as we do with all our businesses. And that way with all the great projects we have in front of us, we'll create a lot of value in this business for shareholders. Gregory Ebel Yes. So that's great, Matthew. And you mentioned the disciplined approach and we have a lot of discussion about that and making sure we are doing exactly that. So let's outline for the group here some of that thoughtful approach that you're dealing with and how we think we're differentiated in that way and our ability to be able to create value versus some others in this sector. Matthew Akman Yes. I think it boils down to the fact that we're not following the renewable I heard. We don't have to invest in the sector. We like it a lot, but there's a lot of players out there in renewables that are kind of following the latest fad. They're zigging and zagging between whatever the latest thing is. And while they're doing that, we're staying on our straight path with our investment discipline, the way we do things. And so we're not taking big development risks, speculative leases. We need long-term contracts. We don't take a lot of commodity exposure. We nailed 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 26
down our construction costs. We have high-quality counterparties. And frankly, if we don't see that, we just don't do projects. So I think a great example of that is [indiscernible] onshore. A few years ago, we saw offshore getting really, really frothy, and we didn't like what we saw there in terms of just the risk/reward -- the fact that there was a lot of speculative investment being made for returns that, frankly, from our standpoint, just didn't compensate. So we quietly pivoted back to onshore where we saw more big corporates, high-quality customers wanting long-term offtake, quick-cycle capital, which we like. And so we made that pivot back towards the onshore. And I think that's going to serve us really well in terms of growth going forward. Gregory Ebel Okay. Well, let's continue along that differentiated approach if you will, and lots of renewable businesses, let's be honest about it, have not been able to realize good returns we have. So maybe let's discuss that and what you think the strength of our competitive position is? Matthew Akman To be positioned for success in today's renewable industry, you might want to -- you might ask yourself, what's a big pipeline midstream business doing and succeeding and how are they going to succeed in this industry. And the answer really boils down to it starts with customers and who the customer is now in this industry and what they're looking for. And what they're looking for is exactly what we provide. These are blue-chip customers from. They're the who's who of large corporates onshore from all the major industry sectors, energy, technology. You've heard of Google and so on already in the space, telecom, financial services, health care, you name it. And these are our kind of customers. A lot of them are already our kind of customers. Gone are the days in the renewable business where it's like 2 guys and their dog in a pickup truck assembling bragawatts. It's not like that anymore. These customers are mature and the business is much more mature. And they're looking for someone who can deliver the capabilities that we have in terms of scale, balance sheet, supply chain management, construction and ultimately, operations. So it's reliable renewables. We're going to get it done for them on time. And that's really critical because these companies in terms of their mission targets, they're relying on us to deliver for them. So they don't just want us to be bragging. They want us to actually deliver what we said we would. Gregory Ebel Yes, 2 dogs and a truck, bragawatts. It sounds like Country Music and Taylor Swift put together, but we'll see. I really like the partnerships we have, too, right? I mean CPPIB has been a good investor sometimes in, sometimes not, that's cool. And in EDF, I don't think you could get a much better player than that. So let's shift gears a little bit. In North American offshore which we don't see as attractive. And I'm not sure we'd ever see as attractive, quite different from really the exciting North American onshore developments and the opportunities there. But outline why we feel that way and how the onshore North American portfolio opportunity really benefits your growth? Matthew Akman 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 26/36

Page 27
Yes, I think our pivot was really timely. We're seeing a really rich seam here in onshore North American renewables of good projects and good returns that we think we can mine for several years. So what's going on here is cost, which was a big problem and supply chain has actually started to moderate quite a bit, especially when you look at the solar side, solar panels in North America, cost has come down a lot. On the offtake situation on the revenue side, the value has actually sustained or maybe you got better. You've got a whole bunch of components there. The energy value is definitely hung in there. The renewable credit value is only going higher with all the demand for offsets. And then the tax benefits, which we really like in the IRA just enhance those for a big taxable company like ours. So when you look at that equation, costs probably stable or down. The offtake in revenue is rising, that all equals better returns, right, which is in our wheelhouse. So the other thing we've got in terms of our positioning, though, is we've got the answer to what is the biggest bottleneck in the industry today, and that's grid access and grid congestion. Through organic growth and the acquisition of Tri Global Energy about 1.5 years ago, we've now got about 2 gigawatts of projects, great projects, great wind resource and great solar resource that have signed interconnection agreements we're about to sign those interconnection agreements. And that's really the secret sauce with all the demand that's going to get us to those really great projects. So I think we can just continue to mine that rich seam that I talked about. And the key for me will be getting a convincing PAT to give me the capital to do it. Gregory Ebel Yes. Well, as long as we struck them utility like and get good returns, we should be able to do that. Let's -- so you've got 6 gigawatts of onshore development opportunities. So outlined for the folks here a little bit about that development pipeline and the key drivers to determine which projects we're going to advance, which ones we don't, and how that gives us confidence in the growth plans going forward. Matthew Akman Yes. So if you want to see what you're going to be hearing about in the near future, just kind of cast your eyes over to the right-hand side of the slide. These are projects that are all construction ready, you see the first tranche over there, and it's really solar in Texas in ERCOT, which is a great market, very liquid, high-quality counterparties. And as I said, the cost of the panels has come down. So those projects are looking really, really good for delivery in the next couple of years. And we're having late-stage conversations with counterparties that they're household names. So I think you'll all be impressed with that when it comes out. And then right after that, we've got a wave of wind in different parts of the country. SPP, those projects are in the Panhandle of Texas. Guess what's right next door, the Permian Basin and lots of customers there with lots of growth, but also a lot of need to offset emissions. So really well positioned in those areas, too, Greg. Gregory Ebel Yes. I sense a data center question coming here. So let's turn to great stuff onshore North America, I realize. But let's turn to offshore. And as I said, we don't really see value and we don't really see value in North America offshore today. But our European offshore portfolio really represents something quite different, and it's been a very positive history and some really great opportunities. So maybe run through why we've been successful in Europe and how we're going to continue to be successful in Europe and add to the growth. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Matthew Akman Yes. It got messy for some people for some of our peers offshore in the last couple of years as you've read, but not for us. And it might surprise some of you to hear that actually some of our best projects in terms of offtake, the overall profile and the returns are in the offshore today, stuff that has just recently come in service, stuff that's operating and stuff that will be coming into service over the next year. Our focus is in France and why is that? Because that's our commercial model. We don't like a lot of the offshore commercial model these days where folks are taking FID before they really have their cost locked down. You're talking about less long-term contracts in some of these areas, and we like those. So we stick to France, primarily for the time being, which has that commercial model, long-term quasi-government offtake. We don't FID stuff until we've nailed down our costs there. We get the lease upfront along with the contract which is great and I'm sure you all agree, we have the best partner in EDF, not a bad partner to have when you're developing in France. So we see good runway there. And then elsewhere, we'll keep an iron in the fire here or there, and we'll be selective and opportunistic if the commercial model and risk profile comes back to our wheelhouse. Robert Hope Rob Hope, Scotiabank. Greg, you've highlighted that the gas distribution utilities were once in a generation opportunity? We're seeing a number of large packages out there in the renewable space. Valuations have compressed. How does M&A fit into the strategy to give it a little bit more of a slice of the pie versus what it is right now? Matthew Akman Well, fortunately, given the size of the company, we do get a chance to look at everything. But again, the same valuation parameters have to be followed, right? So are they utility-like if we bring them in, are they going to be accretive to per share metrics? And are they neutral or accretive to the balance sheet? And I think those last 2 pieces have to date been a challenge, right? Because there's a reason why some of these as Matt has outlined, there's a reason why some of these companies have been beat up either they don't have access to capital. They haven't been able to execute the projects or they've frankly taken a merchant generation type approach to that. We're not interested in that. So when you put that up against the really great backlog of projects that we have, we picked up TGE, and I know Tom is here and Dean as well picked up that a year ago that really set us up nice from a development perspective and smart folks doing good work with you, Matthew on that. It's pretty hard to beat that right now. So can't say never, but we just haven't seen anything that looks more attractive than the organic growth that we have. Benjamin Pham It's Ben Pham, BMO Capital Markets. Matt, maybe can you comment on just how you think about your proposals for additional projects that you've brought to the management team and board in terms of size. Has there been more of a situation where you've had challenges with smaller projects in terms of presenting it and just how that's been evolved for you and how you think about that's going to be evolving going forward? Matthew Akman 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 28/36

Yes. I mean actually, bite-sized projects, I think, are the way to go these days, Ben. And yes, we're a really big company but these projects are utility scale. So they're -- I'd say they're not too big, not too -- it's kind of the Goldilocks, not too big, not too small. They're a multi-hundred million dollar utility scale projects. And for us, I think that's a great place to be because no one wants to take on the mega projects. I like the quick cycle of the onshore also. And so that helps. But despite their -- maybe they're relatively smaller than a multibillion-dollar pipeline. But trust me, these projects can punch way above their weight in terms of near-term accretion, especially with some of the tax benefits. And so you'll see, I think, some of that in the results this year as well. We did guide to significantly higher EBITDA on renewable this year than our guidance last year. So you're actually seeing it, as Greg calls it, it's a really nice kicker, I think, for us financially. Gregory Ebel Yes. And the tech side is beneficial. I mean, the project got to stand on their own, but that tax side is helpful for the rest of the business. I think as we point out, it's highly profitable on that side. And on all by its size, we invested about $1 billion in acquisitions last year. So stop whining. We're moving forward. Matthew Akman Yes, I think we can do, I think, then $1.5 billion a year visibly of good projects, which I think is a nice outer for the company as a whole. Praneeth Satish Praneeth, Wells Fargo. On that point of $1.5 billion per year of CapEx spending. I'm just curious, I guess, how much the interest rate environment impacts the viability of these projects. And if interest rates come down next year, do you think you could see more opportunities and the ability to spend more capital in this space? Just trying to understand the sensitivity there. Matthew Akman Yes. I think for us, it's been helpful actually because as I said, we always have the capital discipline of the hurdle rate we're going to use for these projects -- is the same as for a similar kind of project and another part of our business. I think with the lower interest rates, there was a little bit of, let's say, overzealousness by others and some of our peers and the types of returns they were willing to accept, right? And you're seeing mid-single-digit returns on projects and stuff like that, which we just don't do. So I think the higher interest rate environment has kind of shaken the tree and shaken out some of the weaker, the pickup truck folks that I was talking about and some others. And we'll just maintain our discipline on that, but it actually creates a little bit of running room for us, frankly, and we're seeing a huge appetite, again, to work with us -- and we're seeing the pro formas really pencil out nicely even in this interest rate environment. Gregory Ebel Yes, I would agree with that. I think the fact that we didn't account on some overly aggressive leverage because the power business has got to compete with the utility business, the GTM business and the liquid side. in the go- 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

go times, we look like we're not going as fast. But in the less delightful financial times, it looks like we've had that pace. And I think that's why you can increase the dividend 29 years in a row, right? Don't get too crazy when things are humming along, don't get sucked in because someone's just get a problem. Does this look good. There's a reason they have a problem. And I think we've been very disciplined on that approach on whether that will continue. Anything else for Matthew? We're going to see him at lunch too. Matthew, thanks very much. Appreciate it. Now we're going to ask Pat to come on stage. And Pat, thank you for joining me. Patrick Murray Thanks. Can't help to notice, I didn't get a fancy video coming in, maybe that's the new guy thing. I'll have to work on that. Gregory Ebel That's good capital allocation. Patrick Murray That's true put it towards the dividend. I guess that's a good idea. Gregory Ebel Remember, the CFO is super important, but you and I are overhead. These guys are making revenues so we don't get a little video on there, right? So Look, we just heard a lot of the business units talk about the exciting growth prospects and the opportunities for the business. But let's talk about how we're going to stay disciplined in carrying out that growth, choose the right ones that ensure that our cash flow, our earnings and dividend keep growing for investors. Patrick Murray Yes, I think I'm very excited with the magnitude of opportunities that you've heard my colleagues talking about today. I think it's a, to be fair, a good issue to have, how do you handle this and then and what do you do from a capital appropriation perspective. So looking forward to what it brings forward. I think I'm agnostic to what commodity it comes from. I think you've heard today, we've got lots of good opportunities. Lots of fundamentals telling us that we're going to need a lot of that for a long time. So I'm a little agnostic on the commodity, but not agnostic on the returns and the risk model. We protect our risk model very closely and have for decades, and we'll continue to do that. I think on the -- your guys' right-hand side, we've talked about our disciplined investment framework. I'm not going to go through that in a lot of detail, but maybe just reiterate kind of our 3 main priorities, and we're looking at projects. One, we talked about a lot, the balance sheet. It needs to be accretive from a per share basis. It needs to generate EBITDA, but it also has to protect that balance sheet. I think you've used the word neutral. I'd like to see them be accretive to the balance sheet. Much like what Colin did this morning, I can call that accretive to the balance sheet. Those are really low multiple expansions of a very strategic asset that actually are beneficial to 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 30/36

Page 31
our balance sheet. That's the kind of projects we're looking for, and we can high grade what we've got to kind of focus on that. We're always returning capital to our shareholders. It's an extremely important piece of the business. We've been doing it for decades. I think you quoted what was a $34 billion of returned dividends in the last 5 years. That's going to be a very important piece of this and that locks in a discipline with our management team around making sure those cash flows are going to be there. They're going to be consistent. They're going to be reliable. So that's a big important piece. And then the growth. And I think when I think about what we've done in the last year, I think that's where we've made probably the largest stride, which is creating some clarity into that growth, not only for the next few years, but even into the back part of the decade with that kind of bedrock of having these utilities as the base and then all these projects that you've heard us talk about and that we've secured, helping grow the business. So really excited about what it looks like. And we get to be selective and very strategic as we pick through these projects. Gregory Ebel Yes. So protect, sustained growth, good words to live by as a CFO, CEO company and obviously, investors as well, too, right? So you and I have given a lot of thought and the whole management team is as we consider leverage and the range and how it makes sense for the company. And of course, we are very comfortable with that 4.5x to 5x debt-to-EBITDA ratio given that business model that we're in and the cash flow quality that we're able to produce and probably feel even more confident about that range given the utility acquisitions as well so let's talk about what gives us that confidence and how that utility business like model is really supportive of the leverage structure that we have. Patrick Murray Yes. I mean we talked about it a lot. I think our 4.5x to 5x is kind of the sweet spot. We're going to end up probably in the middle or lower middle part of that range once we get the full EBITDA power of these utilities in 2025. And I think we'll talk about some capacity we have in the next number of slides, but I think we can use that leverage room as areas to be very opportunistic. And I think they've seen us do that over the last few years. Having that capacity allows opportunistic transactions. I think if we go through it quickly, we talk about this quite often, predictable cash flows, inflation protected on the vast majority of them. Our EBITDA is backstopped by high investment-grade customers. You heard Matthew talk about his customers and how large they are. Our asset footprint has limited commodity price. Think back 2 summers ago, we traded an investment in DCP commodity exposed for a long-haul pipeline out of the Permian, and we've just grown from there. That decreased. We just sold Alliance and Aux Sable. Alliance had some of the shortest contracts in our portfolio. And Aux Sable had some commodity exposure so almost no commodity exposure anymore. And we're one of the only midstream companies out there to have a true utility as a bedrock used to be 12-ish percent. It's now going to be closer to 25% as we go forward. And then think about what we've done on our largest asset, being the mainline. We used to have a volume floor, but we are exposed to basically anything else that happened. And now we've got an 11% to 14.5% collar on that, we still have to perform well. And that's what's so great about those agreements with our shippers. We still got to do what the shippers need us to do to get as many -- as much oil down in the pipeline as we can, but it creates that bottom just to make sure if anything was to happen. So underpins our comfort with that and really the sweet spot that it sits in. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 32
Gregory Ebel Yes. So let's dig a little further and talk a little bit more about that financial capacity to invest. And specifically, how we're going to fund our growth on a go-forward basis. As you well know, internally generated cash flow and additional investment capacity through additional EBITDA really gives us a lot of great optionality. So maybe dig in a little bit and tell us about some of that optionality advantage. Patrick Murray Yes. I mean we've been growing and you stole my line on the virtuous cycle that we have from the EBITDA you think about what Colin talked about and then the amount of EBITDA he generates that EBITDA growth generates more capacity and buildup. We probably have and might surprise some people $8 to $9 billion of capacity we could put to work each year and that would be kind of leverage neutral. Our plans don't assume we use all that, we're kind of $6 to $7 billion-ish and then we got -- we talked about a few billion there that we can decide to be very selective in, to do maybe some strategic transactions maybe an example that would be this morning, pretty small. But with buying the additional docks down the Ingleside, very strategic for the long term allows to optimize the assets right away, but then just grown at an extent that we probably haven't expected before. And if we -- and then the other thing we can do with those dollars is delever a bit as we go. As I said we're going to be in that medium part of our leverage and if we don't find things that's our accretive to not only EPS and DCF to the balance sheet, we can use some of that to pay back that as we go through it. So I think that flexibility is something we've always loved at Enbridge because it enables as you think is light when we bought Ingleside initially. We were able to move and others maybe couldn't because we had capacity to do it and that's really important to us as we have planned our financial horizon to make sure we have that capacity to do things. Gregory Ebel Yes. So you talked about our growth expectations. So let's put it all together and talk about how this situation really blends and extends our growth outlook for the business overall and gets us to be confidently speak about that 5% growth over the longer term. Patrick Murray Yes. I mean I think this is a slide I think that was first brought up at Enbridge's days maybe last year, maybe before. Maybe I'll focus on the things that have changed and haven't changed. So maybe on the things that haven't changed. Near-term outlook, of course, we're reiterating the fact that our '24 outlook doesn't change. We just reiterated that 3 weeks ago on our Q4 call. So expect nobody has expected us to do anything there. And then that long-term outlook. I think if I think about anything on the longer term, that kind of post 2025, '26 is that what we've done is we've enhanced our visibility into that growth. We've got this bedrock, as I call it, of the utility there to help us grow. And then we've been chipping away at the projects as you've heard us announce over the last little while. So feeling really comfortable with that growth. In this kind of near-term area here, the next couple of years, we've upped our EBITDA CAGR growth, which would be expected, given the utility and some of the other things we did last year. And then just like last year, as everybody in the industry is dealing with interest rates, cash taxes to some extent, a little bit lower on both the EPS and DCF, but still really good per share growth. And as an organization, we're very focused on per share growth and making sure that we're adding that value to our shareholders as we go year after year. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

Page 33
Gregory Ebel Yes. There's no doubt about it. And I don't want to lose getting off that table with that 3% piece there. I know you mentioned it, but it's only more solid this year than it was last year. But that's like somebody mentioned to me a 50% increase from where we were last year and that's real dollars in cents. So do you want to talk about some of the optimization activities too? Patrick Murray Yes. So this is something we seem to get a lot of questions about. And you've heard the business talk about it a bit throughout the day here. We always have that kind of 1% to 2%. How do you grow just the base business? And you've heard Colin talk about adding $500 million over the last 10 years with no capital really just from optimizing how long the lines up, how efficiently we can move things through, you heard -- yes, Cynthia talk about the rate strategy and adding $500 million just in these last 3 or 4 years here. And so that's something that we'll continue to do, and that helps that piece. And then we've also got cost synergies as we go through everything we do as an organization, whether it's through supply chain, whether it's through automation, whether it's through how we work with our customers and such. So I think we've been really successful at generating this base growth. I think in some ways, we surprised the market this year when we chose to guide on a base business. But what we really wanted to show people was how does that base business grow take the utility out of it and focus on the base business. And it does have growth embedded in it, and here's where it's going to come from. So hopefully this helps out a little bit of clarity there, and we'll continue to talk about this through the next little while. Gregory Ebel All right. So let's wrap it up and talk about how this all comes together, where the rubber hits the road and really with respect to TSR for our investors, right? Strong balance sheet, robust opportunity set and really an impressive and ongoing track record of returning capital to shareholders, largely through dividends, but all of which really creates a premium valuation dynamics. So maybe talk about that a little bit. Patrick Murray Yes. I mean, if I think about the value that Enbridge brings, I think it's pretty unique in an investment thesis. We're diversified. We've talked about commodity. We're well diversified there. We're also diversified by location. Greg you can always state the number of states, a number of provinces we're in, the countries we're in, all over North America, regulatory regime now from a gas distribution perspective, we have exposure to a number of different regimes as we go through. We've got utility and you very much utility-like cash flows for like 98% to 99% of our cash flow is as an organization. And that's differentiating from all of our peers on the midstream side. We've got a strong balance sheet. We'll work well within our means as we work through that. We've always had a focus on ratable, dependable returnable capital. So that dividend is going to happen every year. It's going to grow every year, and people can expect that from us. And then we're adding transparent growth to that. I think over the last year or two, there's been questions about the organization's size, how can we continue to grow? I think we've added some real clarity and some real transparency into that. And I think we've done that over the last year here. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

So -- and then add to that, we haven't talked a ton about it today. So -- but at the back of the decade kicker with the new energy technologies that are out there, the CO2, the RNG that we started investments in. Those are things that will come along as the decade goes. And we're really excited about doing them in the same way we've built the pipelines out over the last 75 years. Gregory Ebel Yes, absolutely great. Listen, Allen and Linda, you're asking about great people. This is one of our great people. I'm not sure many people knew Pat, previously or they might have seen him in IR roles in the past and treasury and stuff, but I think it really shows the depth of magnitude of financial management, operational management inside the company. So let's open it up for some tough questions for the new CFO. Theresa? Theresa Chen No tough questions. I wanted to ask you, Pat, in terms of looking at future asset rotation, asset divestiture opportunities from your portfolio, are you more likely to prune additional assets with shorter contract duration or higher commodity exposure as you have done recently. To the extent that there is much of the latter left in your portfolio. Is that the most important criteria in your mind as you evaluate what should leave agnostic of the underlying commodity to high grade the utility like return of the remaining portfolio? Or are there other criteria we should think about as well? Patrick Murray Do you want me to start with that? So when I think about divestitures, it's I think, agnostic primarily to the commodity. But I think it's not so much around contract length and commodity. It's really around the strategy of those assets. So there's the view of does an asset worth more in somebody else's hands, and we think it's worth to us. And does that enable another opportunity for us to do something else that's strategic. That's how I think about it. So the other thing I always communicate people, it's not like our capital rotation, as I think about it, is something that we just turn off and on. It's always going on. We're always looking every year at our assets to say, is there something that's changed in the fundamentals, that's the primary item that tells us that this asset might not have the life we thought it did, might not have the growth we thought it did. And what does that mean? And then we identify, do we have somebody that might have more value for that? And will they pay more than we're willing to hold it for? So I think we're pretty agnostic to the commodity, but it's really around the strategy and the long-term growth value of the asset that we hold. And that's what you see I think as I put up. The other thing we'll do a bit more of, I think, in this regard is much like we did with the Alberta Indigenous groups on our regional lines. I think that was a really important project to connect those people that are there and we're on their land and enable us to do that throughout the organization. So I think you'll see a little bit more of that as well. Those tend to take a bit longer to get through, but you'll see some of that. Gregory Ebel Yes. The nice thing is with so many assets, Theresa, we can ensure we get nice double-digit multiples on stuff. So that's a big element of this, too. But yes, I'm glad you mentioned the indigenous side. We'll maybe do that, maybe we won't, we'll see. It's always a challenging effort, but we're always looking at that. And that's probably 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=280420&tid=2609173&e=1863397956&ts=3053334&ref=l6cin7 34/36

more of the qualitative side of things, but it matters, right? Because that allows us to better execute, I would say, our $25 billion of organic growth projects. Keith Stanley Keith Stanley with Wolf. The 7% to 9% EBITDA growth through 2026, can you clarify if that's tied just to your secured projects in the $6 billion to $7 billion a year of CapEx or if that has any placeholder assumptions for some of the pre-FID things you've talked about throughout today. And then somewhat relatedly, just the investment capacity at $8 billion to $9 billion is up significantly from the $6 billion, I think it was last year. Is that simply a function of the gas LDC is giving you more capacity and growth in the company or anything else that's driving that? Patrick Murray I think a couple of things. So on the first question, I think we could be well within that range with the secured program that we have. So it's not required to do additional acquisitions or additional organic projects to hit the '26, 7% to 9% it's driven by the growth we see in the gas utilities driven by our base business growth that I talked about earlier. So could we do better if we use some of our capacity potentially, but we could also use that again, that capacity to pay down debt and just make sure we have running room if we need it. So and then on the capital before, I think the way it was looked at before was not so much as a capacity number as it was, this is how much we've secured, and this is what it can generate as growth. This is a little bit different way of looking at it, which is if you did things at certain multiples what would the capacity be of the organization to stay within the midpoint of our guidance range on the debt to EBITDA. So it's a little bit different take on what we have because we really wanted the market to understand that we have more capacity than the 6% to 7% that we're talking about, it doesn't mean we're going to utilize it on projects and acquisitions. For sure, it means we can do things like delever and do things like that. So it just showed, I think what we really wanted to show through that in a different way of calculating it is the capacity we have as an organization and the flexibility that should afford us over the next number of years. Gregory Ebel It does promote getting capital to EBITDA quicker, right? Because sooner you can do that, the sooner you have $4 to $4.50 of capacity for every dollar of EBITDA we bring in. Another question for Pat? Patrick Murray So you said, new guy, they're being easy on this. Gregory Ebel Yes. All right. Well, good. Thank you very much, Pat. Great stuff. First Investor Day in the role and well done. And we'll maybe just wrap up here and then we'll get folks to lunch. So just to close out the morning, maybe I'll just quickly summarize on one slide. And one more to go. And I really hope it and trust this is what you'll take away from the team today through the discussions, our scale, our 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

diversification and connectivity are really blending and extending that growth right through the end of the decade. In liquids, we generate low-risk, positive free cash flow from strongly utilized systems, systems that -- and optimizations and low-cost expansion opportunities. Those are going to continue to drive a long-term EBITDA growth throughout that business. In the gas transmission business, we really have an unparalleled pipeline and storage position that is ideally suited to serve the growing domestic needs for natural gas as well as increasingly so, the global needs. And there are two, optimizations and strategically located assets are driving more than $18 billion of organic growth opportunities. In gas distribution, we have a diversified footprint going forward, and that generates really predictable returns. The U.S. gas utilities that we're going to pick up here, increase the visibility of that growth right across 4 geographies now. And we've got more than $3 billion of total annual quick cycle capital to invest, which is fully underpinned by the need for affordable, reliable natural gas in those jurisdictions. And then in renewable power, let's not forget that we're well positioned to capitalize on that increasing demand for clean energy. And here, too, we have a really strong track record of disciplined investment. So we see up to $1.5 billion as Matthew said, of renewable growth opportunities going forward. So if you put it all together, our financial strength and the capital discipline will enable us to blend and extend that growth outlook through the end of the decade and deliver long-term double-digit shareholder return. So as we like to say, and you've heard today, Tomorrow's on at Enbridge, and we're ensuring that both our customers and our investors benefit every step of the way. So I want to thank all of you for being here. I hope you've enjoyed the time. And I hope you're going to spend some more time with our teams here. We're going to have a little lunch for everybody that's been online. I know that's a lot of people. Thanks very much. We look forward to buying you a free lunch somewhere down the road. But while everybody is here, please join us, and then we'll get together at the tables. Thanks very much. 3/1/25, 11:59 AM CA$61.81 Enbridge Inc.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Charts reflect continuing operations following the Spinoff Transaction unless otherwise noted. Prior years' results have been recast to reflect continuing operations only. 1 On February 14, 2025, we announced a quarterly dividend on our outstanding common shares of $0.85 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, which represents an increase of 3.3 per cent from TC Energy's proportionate allocation of the dividend following the Spinoff Transaction. This equates to an annual dividend of $3.40 per common share. This was the twenty-fifth consecutive year we have increased the dividend on our common shares and is consistent with our goal of growing our common share dividend at an average annual rate of three to five per cent. 2 Non-GAAP measures | Comparable EBITDA, Comparable earnings, Comparable earnings per common share and Comparable funds generated from operations are non-GAAP measures used throughout this document. These measures do not have any standardized meaning under GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The most directly comparable GAAP measures are segmented earnings (losses), net income (loss), net income (loss) per common share and net cash provided by operations, respectively. Refer to Non-GAAP measures section of the 2024 Annual MD&A (incorporated by reference) for more information about the non-GAAP measures we use and for a reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP equivalent.

François Poirier John Lowe ANNUAL REPORT 2024 A FOCUSED NATURAL GAS AND POWER COMPANY A MESSAGE FROM JOHN AND FRANÇOIS 2024 marked a transformational year in TC Energy’s history. Through our unwavering commitment to safely and reliably deliver energy, we achieved significant milestones to meet the growing needs of North America and the world. The evolving energy landscape continues to create opportunities, and TC Energy is uniquely positioned to seize them as we step into the future as a focused natural gas and power and energy solutions company . SOLID EXECUTION AND FOCUSED PRIORITIES In 2024, we set our collective focus on a clear set of strategic priorities: maximizing the value of our assets through safety and operational excellence executing projects on time and on budget enhancing the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. With relentless focus, we delivered on these priorities, setting the stage for continued growth and success. Most notably, we completed the successful spinoff of our Liquids Pipelines business into a new public company, South Bow Corporation, advanced the Southeast Gateway pipeline project in Mexico on time and under budget, reached commercial in-service on Coastal GasLink, and achieved significant debt reduction, which aligns with our objective of a long-term target of 4.75 times debt-to- EBITDA 3 ratio. These achievements reflect our ability to adapt, innovate and remain steadfast in our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders. 3 Debt-to-EBITDA is a non-GAAP ratio. Adjusted debt and adjusted comparable EBITDA are used to calculate debt-to-EBITDA. This measure does not have any standardized meaning under GAAP and therefore is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We believe that debt-to-EBITDA provides investors with useful information as it reflects our ability to service our debt and other long-term commitments. Refer to TC Energy’s 2024 Quarterly Report to Shareholders (Q4) for information on how debt-to-EBITDA is calculated and reconciliations of adjusted debt and adjusted comparable EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 2

OUR STRATEGY Our vision is to be the trusted leader in North America’s energy infrastructure, committed to excellence in safety, performance and stakeholder relationships. Our mission is to safely and efficiently move, generate and store the critical energy that North America and the world rely on. We are a team of energy problem solvers working to deliver energy in a safe, reliable, secure and affordable manner, while seeking to uphold our value proposition: to deliver solid growth with low risk and repeatable performance, year after year. Our business consists of natural gas transportation and storage, as well as power generation assets: • we deliver natural gas to Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, including to export terminals that ship LNG globally • we generate electricity in Canada and the U.S., primarily from nuclear energy, but also from natural gas, wind and solar assets • we store natural gas in Canada and the U.S. through regulated and non-regulated businesses. These long-life infrastructure assets are anchored by our conservative risk preferences and are generally supported by long-term commercial arrangements and/or rate regulation. We believe that our assets will generate predictable and sustainable cash flows and earnings, providing the cornerstones of our low-risk value proposition. Our long-term strategy is driven by the following key beliefs: • natural gas will continue to play a pivotal role in North America's energy future and support global GHG emissions reduction • the need for reliable, on-demand energy sources will continue to grow • energy assets will become increasingly valuable in a world with growing energy demand and existing challenges in developing new infrastructure.

Our asset mix will continue to evolve with the North American energy mix. We anticipate the following trends in capital allocation over the next several years: • Natural Gas Pipelines will continue to attract capital to meet growing customer demand, driven by coal-to-gas conversion, LNG exports and data centre buildouts • Power and Energy Solutions' capital will primarily be allocated to extending the life and increasing the capacity of the nuclear business. We will make measured investment in emerging technologies to develop capabilities that are complementary to our core businesses, without taking significant commodity price risk, volumetric risk or utilizing unproven technologies • additional discretionary investment will fund select high-grade opportunities in our development projects portfolio and incremental opportunities around existing assets across our businesses.

Key components of our strategy Maximize the value of our assets through safety and operational excellence • Maintaining safe and reliable operations by maximizing availability of assets and ensuring asset integrity, while minimizing environmental impacts, continues to be the foundation of our business • Our extensive network of natural gas pipeline assets connect long-life, low-cost supply basins with premium North American and export markets, which we believe will generate predictable and sustainable cash flows and earnings • Our power and non-regulated storage assets are primarily under long-term contracts that provide stable cash flows and earnings • We continually seek to enhance and protect the value of each of our assets using operational, commercial and other levers while pursuing revenue enhancements such as creating additional capacity in our systems and leveraging commercial marketing activities. Execute our selective portfolio of growth projects • Safety, executability, profitability and reliability are fundamental to our investments • We develop high quality, long-life assets, largely underpinned by long-term contracts or rate regulation. We expect that these investments will contribute to incremental earnings and cash flows as they are placed in service • We believe that our incumbent positions in regions with natural gas and power demand growth are expected to present us with a steady cadence of growth opportunities • We strive to develop projects and manage construction risk in a disciplined manner that maximizes capital efficiency and returns to shareholders • We seek to prudently manage development costs, minimizing capital at risk in a project's early stages • We rely on our experience, as well as our policy, regulatory, commercial, financial, legal and operational expertise to permit, fund, build and integrate new pipelines and other energy infrastructure • We will advance selected opportunities, including lower carbon growth initiatives, in emerging sub-sectors where we are likely to build a strong competitive position, market conditions are appropriate, technology is proven and project risks and returns are known and acceptable. Ensure financial strength and agility • Disciplined capital allocation supports our ability to maximize asset value over the short, medium and long term while protecting and growing our network of assets. We seek to allocate capital in a manner that improves the cost competitiveness and returns of our portfolio, while extending the life of our assets • Our capital allocation process is designed to ensure that we remain within the annual target for net capital spend, while maximizing the expected returns of the projects that we sanction • We assess opportunities to develop and acquire energy infrastructure that complements our existing portfolio, protects and grows our business, enhances future resilience under a changing energy mix and diversifies access to attractive supply and market regions within our risk preferences • We monitor trends specific to energy supply and demand fundamentals, in addition to analyzing how our portfolio performs under different energy mix scenarios. This enables the identification of opportunities that we believe will contribute to our resilience, strengthen our asset base and/or improve diversification • We believe that our high-quality, diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets results in predictable, low-risk cash flows and positions us well to succeed under various energy transition scenarios and across all economic cycles • We continually seek to enhance our core competencies in safety, operational excellence, investment opportunity origination, project execution, stakeholder relations and sustainability to ensure we deliver shareholder value. 16 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

How we operate our business The need for safe, reliable, secure and affordable energy solutions has become increasingly important. Decades of experience in the energy infrastructure business, a disciplined approach to project management and a proven capital allocation model result in a solid competitive position as we remain focused on our purpose – to connect the world to the energy it needs. We will do this through: • strong leadership and governance: we maintain rigorous governance over our approach to business ethics, enterprise risk management, competitive behaviour, operating capabilities and strategy development, as well as regulatory, legal, commercial, stakeholder and financing support • a high-quality portfolio: the strategic advantage supporting our vision is our extensive asset footprint in an industry with high barriers to entry. Our low-risk portfolio of assets offers the scale to provide essential and highly competitive infrastructure services, enabling us to maximize the full-life value of our investments throughout all points of the business cycle. Our platforms not only provide a diversified portfolio but also position TC Energy as a leader in the energy infrastructure sector. Our synergistic footprint supports both molecules and electrons, providing us flexibility to allocate capital towards natural gas, electrification or other emerging lower-carbon technologies that are complementary to our core businesses • disciplined operations: our workforce is highly skilled in designing, building and operating energy infrastructure with a focus on safety and operational excellence and a commitment to the environment in the communities we serve that is suited to both today's environment, as well as an evolving energy industry • financial positioning: we exhibit consistently strong financial performance, long-term stability and profitability, along with a disciplined approach to capital investment. We can access competitively-priced capital to support new investments while preserving financial flexibility, including portfolio management, to fund our operations in all market conditions. We aim to deliver a balance of dividend income and share price growth • proven ability to adapt: we have a long track record of turning policy and technology changes into opportunities – for example, re-entering Mexico when the country shifted from fuel oil to natural gas, reversing pipeline flows in response to the shale gas revolution, installing electric compression and/or switching gas compression to electrification and currently assessing development of grid-scale, flexible and clean energy storage • commitment to sustainability: we take a long-term view to managing our interactions with the environment, Indigenous groups, community members and landowners. We aim to communicate transparently to all rights holders and stakeholders on sustainability-related topics and publish annually our corporate GHG emissions intensity in our Report on Sustainability. We continue to focus on our sustainability commitments, which reflect the interests of our business, Indigenous rights holders and stakeholders; positioning us for long-term success. We are committed to collectively advancing a lower-emissions energy system and expect to provide an update on our interim GHG emission reduction target in 2025 to reflect the impact of the Liquids Pipelines business spinoff and projected increased utilization across our systems. We remain focused on our long-term goal of positioning to reach net-zero emissions from our operations by 2050 and acknowledge that achieving this goal requires accelerated changes in global energy policies, regulations and support for new technologies. We continue to focus on our nine sustainability commitments and associated metrics and targets that help ensure our business is well positioned for long-term success • open communication: we carefully manage relationships with our customers, suppliers, regulators and other stakeholders and offer clear, candid communication to investors in order to build trust and support • culture and people: our people are our most important asset and living our company values of safety, personal accountability, working as one team and active learning. These values shape how we do business and, in turn, deliver on our commitments. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 17

2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We use certain financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP because we believe they improve our ability to compare results between reporting periods and enhance understanding of our operating performance. Known as non-GAAP measures, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. Comparable EBITDA, comparable earnings and comparable earnings per common share from continuing and discontinued operations and comparable funds generated from operations are all non-GAAP measures. Refer to page 24 for more information about the non-GAAP measures we use, as well as the Financial results section in each business segment and Discontinued operations section for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. As discussed on page 10 of the About this document section, results of the Liquids Pipelines business are reported as a discontinued operation. To allow for a meaningful comparison, discussions throughout this MD&A are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Prior year results have been recast to reflect the split between continuing and discontinued operations. Discontinued operations reflect nine months of Liquids Pipelines earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a full year of Liquids Pipelines earnings in 2023 and 2022.

Cash flows Net cash provided by operations of $7.7 billion in 2024 was six per cent higher than 2023 primarily due to higher funds generated from continuing operations and the amount and timing of working capital changes. Comparable funds generated from operations of $7.9 billion in 2024 were one per cent lower than 2023 primarily due to lower comparable earnings, partially offset by increased distributions from our equity investments.

In 2024 and 2023, we invested $7.9 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively, in capital projects to maintain and optimize the value of our existing assets and to develop new, complementary assets in high-demand areas. Our total capital spending in 2024 and 2023 included contributions of $1.5 billion (net of distributions) and $4.1 billion, respectively, to our equity investments, predominantly related to Coastal GasLink Limited Partnership (Coastal GasLink LP) and Bruce Power. Proceeds from sales of assets In 2024, TC Energy and its partner, Northern New England Investment Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Énergir L.P. (Énergir), completed the sale of Portland Natural Gas Transmission System (PNGTS) to a third party. Our share of the proceeds was $743 million (US$546 million), net of transaction costs. In 2024, we also completed the sale of other non-core assets for gross proceeds of $48 million. In 2023, we completed the sale of a 20.1 per cent equity interest in Port Neches Link LLC to its joint venture partner, Motiva Enterprises, for gross proceeds of $33 million (US$25 million). As part of the Spinoff Transaction on October 1, 2024, our remaining interest in Port Neches Link LLC was transferred to South Bow. Acquisitions In 2023, we acquired 100 per cent of the Class B Membership Interests in Fluvanna Wind Farm and Blue Cloud Wind Farm (Texas Wind Farms) for US$224 million, before post-closing adjustments. Balance sheet We continue to maintain a solid financial position while growing our total assets, excluding discontinued operations, by $8.3 billion in 2024. At December 31, 2024, common shareholders' equity and non-controlling interests, represented 37 per cent (2023 – 37 per cent) of our capital structure, while other subordinated capital, in the form of junior subordinated notes and preferred shares, represented an additional 14 per cent (2023 – 13 per cent).

Dividends Commencing with the dividends payable on January 31, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2024, the amounts reflect TC Energy’s proportionate allocation following the Spinoff Transaction. Refer to the Discontinued operations section for additional information. On February 14, 2025, we announced a quarterly dividend on our outstanding common shares of $0.85 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, which represents an increase of 3.3 per cent from TC Energy's proportionate allocation of the dividend following the Spinoff Transaction. This equates to an annual dividend of $3.40 per common share. This was the twenty-fifth consecutive year we have increased the dividend on our common shares and is consistent with our goal of growing our common share dividend at an average annual rate of three to five per cent. Dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan Under the DRP, eligible holders of common and preferred shares of TC Energy can reinvest their dividends and make optional cash payments to obtain additional TC Energy common shares. From August 31, 2022 to July 31, 2023, common shares were issued from treasury at a discount of two per cent to market prices over a specified period.

NON-GAAP MEASURES This MD&A references non-GAAP measures, which are described in the table below. These measures do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures are reviewed regularly by our President and Chief Executive Officer, management and the Board of Directors in assessing our performance and making decisions regarding the ongoing operations of our business and its ability to generate cash flows. Some or all of these measures may also be used by investors and other external users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure to provide decision-useful information regarding our period-over-period performance and ability to generate earnings that are core to our ongoing operations. Discussions throughout this MD&A on the factors impacting comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (comparable EBITDA) and comparable earnings before interest and taxes (comparable EBIT) are consistent with the factors that impact segmented earnings, except where noted otherwise. Comparable measures We calculate comparable measures by adjusting certain GAAP measures for specific items we believe are significant but not reflective of our underlying operations in the period. Except as otherwise described herein, these comparable measures are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period, as applicable. Our decision to adjust for a specific item in reporting comparable measures is subjective and made after careful consideration. We maintain a consistent approach to adjustments, which generally fall into the categories described below: • by their nature are unusual, infrequent and separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are not reflective of our underlying operations in the period and generally include the following: ◦ gains or losses on sales of assets or assets held for sale; impairment of goodwill, plant, property and equipment, equity investments and other assets; legal, contractual and other infrequent settlements; acquisition, integration and restructuring costs; expected credit loss provisions on net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico; impacts resulting from changes in legislation and enacted tax rates and unusual tax refunds/payments and valuation allowance adjustments • unrealized gains and losses related to fair value adjustments that do not reflect realized earnings or losses or cash impacts incurred in the current period from our underlying operations and generally include the following: ◦ unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives related to financial and commodity price risk management activities; unrealized fair value adjustments related to our proportionate share of Bruce Power’s risk management activities and its funds invested for post-retirement benefits; unrealized fair value adjustments on intercompany loans that impact consolidated earnings. The following table identifies our non-GAAP measures against their most directly comparable GAAP measures. These measures are applicable to each of our continuing operations and discontinued operations. Quantitative reconciliations of our comparable measures to their GAAP measures and a discussion of specific adjustments made for 2024 and comparative periods can be found on pages 26 and 27, the Financial results section in each business segment, and the Financial condition section. Non-GAAP measures for discontinued operations are found in the Discontinued operations section on page 96.

Comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT Comparable EBITDA represents segmented earnings (losses) adjusted for specific items described in the Comparable measures section, excluding charges for depreciation and amortization. We use comparable EBITDA as a measure of our earnings from ongoing operations as it is a useful indicator of our performance and is also presented on a consolidated basis. Comparable EBIT represents segmented earnings (losses) adjusted for specific items and is an effective tool for evaluating trends in each segment. Refer to each business segment and the Discontinued operations section for a reconciliation to segmented earnings (losses). Funds generated from operations and comparable funds generated from operations Funds generated from operations reflects net cash provided by operations before changes in operating working capital. The components of changes in working capital are disclosed in Note 29, Changes in operating working capital, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements. Comparable funds generated from operations is adjusted for the cash impact of specific items described in the Comparable measures section. We believe funds generated from operations and comparable funds generated from operations are useful measures of our consolidated operating cash flows because they exclude fluctuations from working capital balances, which do not necessarily reflect underlying operations in the same period, and are used to provide a consistent measure of the cash-generating ability of our businesses. Refer to the Financial condition section for a reconciliation to Net cash provided by operations. Comparable earnings and comparable earnings per common share Comparable earnings represents earnings attributable to common shareholders on a consolidated basis, adjusted for specific items described in the Comparable measures section. Comparable earnings is comprised of segmented earnings (losses), Interest expense, AFUDC, Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net, Interest income and other, Income tax expense (recovery), Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests and Preferred share dividends on our Consolidated statement of income, adjusted for specific items. We use comparable earnings as a measure of our earnings from ongoing operations as it is a useful indicator of our performance and is also presented on a consolidated basis. Refer to page 27 and the Discontinued operations section for reconciliations to Net income (loss) attributable to common shares and Net income (loss) per common share for our continuing operations and discontinued operations.

In addition, we retired outstanding callable notes at par. These extinguishments of debt resulted in a pre-tax net gain of $228 million, primarily due to fair value discounts and unamortized debt issue costs. The net gain on debt extinguishment was recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated statement of income. Refer to the Financial condition section for additional information. 3 In 2023, TCPL and TGNH became party to an unsecured revolving credit facility. The loan receivable and loan payable are eliminated upon consolidation; however, due to differences in the currency that each entity reports its financial results, there is an impact to net income reflecting the revaluation and translation of the loan receivable and loan payable to TC Energy's reporting currency. As the amounts do not accurately reflect what will be realized at settlement, we exclude from comparable measures the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on the loan receivable, as well as the corresponding unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on the loan payable, net of non-controlling interest. 4 In 2022, TGNH and the CFE executed agreements which consolidate several natural gas pipelines under one TSA. As this TSA contains a lease, we have recognized amounts in net investment in leases on our Consolidated balance sheet. As required by U.S. GAAP, we have recognized an expected credit loss provision related to net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico, which will fluctuate from period to period based on changing economic assumptions and forward-looking information. This provision is an estimate of losses that may occur over the duration of the TSA through 2055. This provision does not reflect losses or cash outflows that were incurred under this lease arrangement in the current period or from our underlying operations, and therefore, we have excluded any unrealized changes, net of non-controlling interest, from comparable measures. Refer to Note 28, Risk management and financial instruments, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. 5 In 2022, we launched the Focus Project with benefits in the form of enhanced safety, productivity and cost-effectiveness expected to be realized in the future. Beginning in 2023, we recognized expenses in Plant operating costs and other, for external consulting and severance, some of which are not recoverable through regulatory and commercial tolling structures.

Page 31
Comparable EBITDA from continuing operations 2024 versus 2023 Comparable EBITDA from continuing operations in 2024 increased by $577 million compared to 2023 primarily due to the net result of the following: • increased Power and Energy Solutions EBITDA primarily attributable to higher contributions from Bruce Power due to higher generation and a higher contract price, and Natural Gas Storage and other due to higher realized Alberta natural gas storage spreads, partially offset by decreased Canadian Power earnings primarily due to lower realized power prices net of lower natural gas fuel costs • higher U.S. dollar-denominated EBITDA from Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines mainly due to increased equity earnings from Sur de Texas as a result of peso-denominated financial exposure and lower income tax expense • increased EBITDA from Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines primarily due to higher flow-through costs and increased rate-base earnings on the NGTL System and Foothills, partially offset by lower earnings from Coastal GasLink related to the recognition of a $200 million incentive payment in 2023 • higher U.S. dollar-denominated EBITDA from U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines due to incremental earnings from growth projects placed in service and additional contract sales, partially offset by higher operational costs and decreased earnings as a result of the sale of PNGTS, which was completed on August 15, 2024 • the positive foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the Canadian dollar equivalent comparable EBITDA in our U.S. dollar-denominated operations. As detailed on page 79, U.S. dollar-denominated comparable EBITDA from continuing operations increased by US$180 million compared to 2023, which was translated to Canadian dollars at an average rate of 1.37 in 2024 versus 1.35 in 2023. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. 2023 versus 2022 Comparable EBITDA from continuing operations in 2023 increased by $989 million compared to 2022 primarily due to the net result of the following: • increased EBITDA from Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines primarily due to higher flow-through costs and increased rate-base earnings on the NGTL System and higher earnings from Coastal GasLink related to the recognition of a $200 million incentive payment upon meeting certain milestones • increased Power and Energy Solutions EBITDA primarily attributable to higher contributions from Bruce Power as a result of a higher contract price, fewer planned outage days and lower depreciation expense, partially offset by increased business development activities across the segment • higher U.S. dollar-denominated EBITDA from U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines due to incremental earnings from growth projects placed in service, a net increase in earnings from ANR resulting from an increase in transportation rates effective August 2022, higher realized margins related to our U.S. natural gas marketing business, partially offset by higher operational costs reflective of increased system utilization and lower commodity prices related to our mineral rights business • higher U.S. dollar-denominated EBITDA from Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines primarily related to certain sections of the Villa de Reyes and Tula pipelines that were placed in commercial service in third quarter 2022 and 2023, partially offset by lower equity earnings from Sur de Texas primarily due to peso-denominated financial exposure and higher interest expense • the positive foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the Canadian dollar equivalent comparable EBITDA in our U.S. dollar-denominated operations. As detailed on page 79,U.S. dollar-denominated comparable EBITDA from continuing operations increased by US$100 million compared to 2022, which was translated to Canadian dollars at an average rate of 1.35 in 2023 versus 1.30 in 2022. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. Due to the flow-through treatment of certain costs including income taxes, financial charges and depreciation in our Canadian rate-regulated pipelines, changes in these costs impact our comparable EBITDA despite having no significant effect on net income.

SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL MEASURE Net capital expenditures Net capital expenditures represents capital costs incurred for growth projects, maintenance capital expenditures, contributions to equity investments and projects under development, adjusted for the portion attributed to non-controlling interests in the entities we control. Net capital expenditures reflect capital costs incurred during the period, excluding the impact of timing of cash payments. We use net capital expenditures as a key measure in evaluating our performance in managing our capital spending activities in comparison to our capital plan. Net capital expenditures does not include an adjustment related to the CFE’s minority interest in TGNH capital expenditures until after the in-service of the projects included as part of the 2022 strategic alliance between TGNH and the CFE, including Villa de Reyes, Southeast Gateway and Tula. The CFE’s contribution in second quarter 2024 to obtain a 13.01 per cent equity interest in TGNH included consideration of its proportionate share of required capital contributions for approved projects. Net capital expenditures will be adjusted for any new capital projects approved in TGNH going forward. OUTLOOK Comparable EBITDA and comparable earnings - continuing operations We expect our 2025 comparable EBITDA to be higher than 2024 comparable EBITDA due to the net impact of the following: • new projects anticipated to be placed in service in 2025, including the Southeast Gateway pipeline, along with the full-year impact of projects placed in service in 2024 • higher contributions from the NGTL System resulting from the five-year negotiated revenue requirement settlement • reduced generation from Bruce Power due to the commencement of the Unit 4 Major Component Replacement (MCR) outage. Our 2025 comparable earnings per common share is expected to be lower than 2024 comparable earnings per common share considering the net impact of the following: • increase in comparable EBITDA described above • lower AFUDC due to the Southeast Gateway pipeline expected to be placed in service on May 1, 2025 • lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates • increased depreciation rates on the NGTL System related to the five-year negotiated revenue requirement settlement • reduced capitalized interest due to the Coastal GasLink pipeline commercial in-service • higher effective tax rates. Consolidated capital expenditures In 2024, we incurred approximately $8.2 billion in gross capital expenditures on our secured capital program and projects under development, as well as capitalized interest and AFUDC, where applicable. Net capital expenditures after adjusting for the capital expenditures attributable to the non-controlling interests of entities we control was $7.4 billion. The majority of our 2025 capital program is focused on the advancement of secured projects including U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines projects, NGTL System expansions, the Southeast Gateway pipeline, Bruce Power MCR programs and normal course maintenance capital expenditures. Prior to adjustments for non-controlling interests, we expect to incur gross capital expenditures of approximately $6.1 to $6.6 billion in 2025. We anticipate our net capital expenditures in 2025 to be approximately $5.5 to $6.0 billion. Refer to the Outlook section in each business segment for additional details on expected earnings and capital expenditures for 2025. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 31

CAPITAL PROGRAM We are developing quality projects under our capital program. These long-life infrastructure assets are supported by long-term commercial arrangements with creditworthy counterparties and/or regulated business models and are expected to generate growth in earnings and cash flows. Our capital program consists of approximately $25 billion of secured projects that represent commercially supported, committed projects that are either under construction or are in, or preparing to, commence the permitting stage. Three years of maintenance capital expenditures for our businesses are included in the Secured projects table. Maintenance capital expenditures on our regulated Canadian and U.S. natural gas pipelines are added to rate base on which we have the opportunity to earn a return and recover these expenditures through current or future tolls, which is similar to our capacity capital projects on these pipelines. During 2024, we placed approximately $6.8 billion of projects into service, which included natural gas pipeline capacity projects along our extensive North American asset footprint and our share of equity contributions related to the Coastal GasLink pipeline, as well as progress on the Bruce Power life extension program. In addition, approximately $2.3 billion of maintenance capital expenditures were incurred and $0.3 billion of modernization capital expenditures were placed in service. All projects are subject to cost and timing adjustments due to factors including weather, market conditions, route refinement, land acquisition, permitting conditions, scheduling and timing of regulatory permits, as well as other potential restrictions and uncertainties, including inflationary pressures on labour and materials. Amounts exclude capitalized interest and AFUDC, where applicable. 32 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Projects under development In addition to our secured projects, we are pursuing a portfolio of quality projects in various stages of development across each of our business units. Projects under development have greater uncertainty with respect to timing and estimated project costs and are subject to corporate and regulatory approvals, unless otherwise noted. New growth opportunities will be assessed within our disciplined capital allocation framework in order to fit within our annual capital expenditure parameters. As these new opportunities advance and reach required milestones, they will be included in the Secured projects table. Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines We continue to focus on optimizing the utilization and value of our existing Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines assets, including sanctioned in-corridor expansions, providing connectivity to LNG export terminals, connecting growing WCSB gas supplies to domestic and export markets and other opportunities, including progressing our Multi-Year Growth Plan (MYGP). The MYGP is comprised of multiple distinct projects with targeted in-service dates between 2027 and 2030 that are subject to final corporate and regulatory approvals. U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines We are currently pursuing a variety of projects that are expected to replace, upgrade, expand and extend our U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines footprint. The enhanced facilities associated with these projects are expected to improve the reliability of our systems, reduce GHG emissions intensity and provide additional transportation capacity under long-term contracts. We continue to see growing demand across multiple segments, driving potential expansion projects to support new natural gas-fired power generation, coal to natural gas conversions, LDC growth and data centres. Our footprint is well positioned to supply natural gas through our existing utility customer base or by way of direct connections. Additional opportunities include RNG through direct interconnects, continued LNG development in proximity to our footprint and LDC peak day growth. Power and Energy Solutions Bruce Power Life Extension Program The continuation of Bruce Power’s life extension program will require the investment of our proportionate share of both the MCR program costs on Units 5, 7 and 8 and the remaining Asset Management program costs, which continue beyond the completion of the MCR program in 2033, extending the life of Units 3 to 8 and the Bruce Power site to 2064. Preparation work for the Unit 5, 7 and 8 MCRs is underway and future MCR investments will be subject to discrete decisions for each unit with specified off-ramps available to Bruce Power and the IESO. Refer to the Power and Energy Solutions – Significant events section for additional information. The Unit 5 MCR final cost and schedule estimate was submitted to the IESO on January 31, 2025. Energy Solutions Ontario Pumped Storage With our prospective partners, Saugeen Ojibway Nation, we continue to advance the Ontario Pumped Storage Project, an energy storage facility located in Meaford, Ontario. The 1,000 MW project is expected to provide enough electricity to power one million homes for up to 11 hours, while enhancing the reliability and efficiency of Ontario's electricity system. Using water and gravity, the project is like a natural battery that will store surplus electricity when demand is low and later redeploy it during periods of high demand. The project will support the planned buildout of Ontario’s nuclear fleet and can deliver Ontario’s clean nuclear power on demand. 34 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Alberta Carbon Grid In June 2021, we announced a partnership with Pembina Pipeline Corporation to jointly develop a world-scale system which, when fully constructed, is expected to be capable of transporting and sequestering more than 20 million tonnes of CO 2 annually. As an open-access system, the Alberta Carbon Grid (ACG) is intended to serve as the backbone for Alberta’s emerging carbon capture utilization and storage industry. In October 2022, ACG entered into a carbon sequestration evaluation agreement with the Government of Alberta to further evaluate one of the largest Areas of Interest (AOI) for safely storing carbon from industrial emissions in Alberta. ACG continues to progress an appraisal program needed to evaluate the suitability of our AOI, including the advancement and completion of well drilling and testing activities to support the development of a detailed Measurement, Monitoring and Verification plan required to apply for a sequestration permit. We are continuing to advance discussions on a commercial agreement with customers that aligns with our risk preferences. Other Energy Solutions Projects Our focus in Energy Solutions includes piloting new technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture for our natural gas business, continued partnerships and investments in emerging technologies and the selective development of decarbonization solutions for customers, allowing us to stay ahead of technological adoption trends. If successful, these technologies are expected to enable us to build capabilities that will allow us to reduce the emissions intensity from our existing assets, which will help enhance and preserve the value of our natural gas networks while also capitalizing on lower-carbon investment opportunities that are underpinned by commercial models that meet our risk preferences.

NATURAL GAS PIPELINES BUSINESS Our natural gas pipeline network transports natural gas from supply basins to local distribution companies, power generation plants, industrial facilities, interconnecting pipelines, LNG export terminals and other businesses across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Our network of pipelines taps into most major supply basins and transports over 30 per cent of continental daily natural gas needs through: • wholly-owned natural gas pipelines – 63,322 km (39,345 miles) • partially-owned natural gas pipelines – 30,365 km (18,868 miles). In addition to our natural gas pipelines, we have regulated natural gas storage facilities in the U.S. with a total working gas capacity of 532 Bcf, making us one of the largest providers of natural gas storage and related services to key markets in North America. Our Natural Gas Pipelines business is split into three operating segments representing its geographic diversity: Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines and Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines. Strategy Our strategy is to maximize the value of our existing natural gas pipeline systems in a safe and reliable manner while responding to the changing flow patterns of natural gas in North America. We also pursue new pipeline opportunities to add incremental value to our business. Our key areas of focus include: • primarily in-corridor expansion and extension of our existing significant North American natural gas pipeline footprint • connections to new and growing industrial and electric power generation markets and LDCs • expanding our systems in key locations in North America and developing new projects to provide connectivity to LNG export terminals, both operating and proposed • connections to growing Canadian and U.S. shale gas and other supplies • minimizing our GHG and methane emissions through operational excellence. Each of these areas plays a critical role in meeting the transportation requirements for supply of and demand for natural gas in North America. Our natural gas pipeline systems are helping solve the energy trilemma - energy security, affordability and sustainability. We believe natural gas provides a reliable, high-efficiency energy source that is helping to support the displacement of coal-fired power while backstopping the intermittency of renewable power sources across North America. We continue to improve operational efficiencies and factor ESG considerations into our decision making around new projects, modernization, maintenance, electrification and enhanced leak detection. Further, a growing number of RNG customers are connecting to our system. Our business model provides socioeconomic benefits as we work closely with Indigenous communities, community- based organizations, landowners, rights holders and other stakeholders in alignment with our values and sustainability commitments. 36 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

UNDERSTANDING OUR NATURAL GAS PIPELINES BUSINESS Natural gas pipelines move natural gas from major sources of supply to locations or markets that use natural gas to meet their energy needs. Our natural gas pipelines business builds, owns and operates a network of natural gas pipelines across North America that connects gas production to interconnects, end-use markets and LNG export terminals. The network includes underground pipelines that transport natural gas predominantly under high pressure, compressor stations that act like pumps to move large volumes of natural gas along the pipeline, meter stations that record the amount of natural gas coming on the network at receipt locations and leaving the network at delivery locations and regulated natural gas storage facilities that provide services to customers and help maintain the overall balance of the pipeline systems. Our major pipeline systems The Natural Gas Pipelines map on page 41 shows our extensive pipeline network in North America that connects major supply sources and markets. The highlights shown on the map include: Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines NGTL and Foothills System: These are our natural gas gathering and transportation system for the WCSB, connecting most of the natural gas production in western Canada to domestic and export markets. We are well positioned to connect growing supply in northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta. Our capital program for new pipeline facilities is driven by these two supply areas, along with growing demand for intra-Alberta firm transportation for electric power generation, oil sands development and petro-chemical feedstock, as well as to our major export points at the Empress and Alberta/British Columbia delivery locations. The NGTL System is also well positioned to connect WCSB supply to LNG export facilities on the Canadian west coast through future extensions or expansions of the system or future connections to other pipelines serving that area. Canadian Mainline: This pipeline supplies markets in the Canadian Prairies, Ontario, Québec, the Canadian Maritimes, as well as to U.S. markets including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and U.S. Northeast from the WCSB and, through interconnects, from the Appalachian basin. Coastal GasLink: This pipeline supplies WCSB natural gas from interconnections with the NGTL System and other pipelines to the LNG Canada facility on the coast of British Columbia. This pipeline will also feed the Cedar LNG project once built later this decade. We have a 35 per cent equity interest and are the operator of this pipeline. U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines Columbia Gas: This is our natural gas transportation system for the Appalachian basin, which contains the Marcellus and Utica shale plays, two of the largest natural gas shale plays in North America. Similar to our footprint in the WCSB, our Columbia Gas assets are well positioned to connect growing supply to markets in this area. This system also interconnects with other pipelines that provide access to key markets in the U.S. Northeast, the Midwest, the Atlantic coast and south to the Gulf of Mexico and its growing demand for natural gas to serve LNG exports. We have a 60 per cent ownership interest and are the operator of this pipeline. ANR: This pipeline system connects supply basins and markets throughout the U.S. Midwest and south to the Gulf of Mexico. This includes connecting supply in Texas, Oklahoma, the Appalachian basin and the Gulf of Mexico to markets in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. In addition, ANR has bidirectional capability on its Southeast Mainline and delivers gas produced from the Appalachian basin to customers throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Columbia Gulf: This pipeline system transports growing Appalachian basin supplies to various U.S. Gulf Coast markets and LNG export terminals from its interconnections with Columbia Gas and other pipelines. We have a 60 per cent ownership interest and are the operator of this pipeline. Other U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines: We have ownership interests in nine wholly-owned or partially-owned natural gas pipelines serving major markets in the U.S. 38 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines Sur de Texas: This offshore pipeline transports natural gas from Texas to power and industrial markets in the eastern and central regions of Mexico. The average volumes transported by this pipeline in 2024 supplied approximately 17 per cent of Mexico's total natural gas imports via pipelines. We have a 60 per cent equity interest and are the operator of this pipeline. Northwest System: The Topolobampo and Mazatlán pipelines make up our Mexico northwest system. The system runs through the states of Chihuahua and Sinaloa, supplying power plants and industrial facilities, bringing natural gas to a region of the country that previously did not have access to it. TGNH System: This system is located in the central region of Mexico and is comprised of the Tamazunchale pipeline and the Tula, Villa de Reyes and Southeast Gateway pipelines with sections that are either in-service or currently under construction. This system supplies, or will supply, several power plants and industrial facilities in Campeche, Yucatán, Veracruz, Tabasco, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro and Hidalgo. It has interconnects with upstream pipelines that bring in supply from the Agua Dulce and Waha hubs in Texas. The TGNH System is part of a strategic alliance with the CFE, Mexico’s state-owned electric utility, which holds a 13.01 per cent ownership interest in the system. We have an 86.99 per cent ownership interest and are the operator of these pipelines. Guadalajara: This bidirectional pipeline connects imported LNG supply near Manzanillo and continental gas supply near Guadalajara to power plants and industrial customers in the states of Colima and Jalisco. Regulation of tolls and cost recovery Our natural gas pipelines are generally regulated by the CER in Canada and FERC in the U.S. In Mexico, the regulation of our natural gas pipelines is being transitioned from the CRE to a new regulatory body under the Secretaría de Energía (SENER). These entities regulate the construction, operation and requested abandonment of pipeline infrastructure. Regulators in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico allow us to recover costs to operate the network by collecting tolls for services. These tolls generally include a return on our capital invested in the assets or rate base, as well as recovery of the rate base over time through depreciation. Other costs generally recovered through tolls include OM&A, taxes and interest on debt. The regulators review our costs to ensure they are reasonable and prudently incurred and approve tolls that provide a reasonable opportunity to recover those costs. Business environment and strategic priorities The North American natural gas pipeline network has been developed to connect diverse supply regions to domestic markets and to meet demand from LNG export facilities. Use and growth of this infrastructure is affected by changes in the location and relative cost of natural gas supplies, as well as changes in the location of markets and level of demand. We have significant pipeline footprints that serve two of the most prolific supply regions of North America – the WCSB and the Appalachian basin. Our pipelines also source natural gas from other significant basins including the Rockies, Williston, Haynesville, Fayetteville and Anadarko basins, as well as the Gulf of Mexico. We expect continued growth in North American natural gas production to meet demand within growing domestic markets, particularly in the electric generation and industrial sectors which benefit from a relatively low natural gas price. In addition, North American supply is expected to benefit from increased natural gas demand in Mexico and growing access to international markets via LNG exports. We expect North American natural gas demand, including LNG exports, of approximately 150 Bcf/d by 2028, reflecting an increase of approximately 28 Bcf/d from 2023 levels. As the world shifts toward a lower-carbon economy, we believe that further retirements of coal-fired power generation as well as export demand growth over the next five to 10 years will offer growth opportunities for base-load power from natural gas-fired generation. We expect that this projected growth in demand for natural gas, coupled with the anticipated increases in key producing areas like WCSB, onshore Gulf Coast, Appalachian and the Permian basin, will provide investment opportunities for pipeline infrastructure companies to build new facilities or increase utilization of their existing footprint. Modernizing our existing systems and assets and decarbonizing our energy consumption along our natural gas pipeline systems is expected to provide ongoing additional capital investment opportunities that will meet our risk preferences while supporting our GHG emissions intensity reduction goal. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 39

Page 42
Changing demand The abundant supply of natural gas has supported increased demand, particularly in the following areas: • natural gas-fired power generation, including for use in emerging data centres • global LNG exports • petrochemical and industrial facilities • Alberta oil sands. Natural gas producers continue to progress opportunities to sell natural gas to global markets which involves connecting natural gas supplies to LNG export terminals, both operating and proposed, along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the east and west coasts of Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. The increasing export of natural gas to Mexico is driven by the CFE’s need to serve existing markets and requires pipelines to serve new regions. We believe that natural gas is a key energy transition fuel for Mexico. Overall, we are forecasting significant natural gas demand growth in the future to support economic expansion and industrial load growth, conversion to lower GHG emission-intensive fuels for industrial and power generation use and LNG export prospects. The demand created by these new markets provides additional opportunities for us to build new pipeline infrastructure and to increase throughput on our existing pipelines. Commodity prices The profitability of our natural gas pipelines business is not directly tied to commodity prices given we are a transporter of the commodity and the transportation tolls are not tied to the price of natural gas. However, the cyclical supply and demand nature of commodities and related pricing can have an indirect impact on our business where producers may choose to accelerate or delay development of gas reserves or, similarly on the demand side, projects requiring natural gas may be accelerated or delayed depending on market or price conditions. More competition Changes in supply and demand levels and locations have resulted in increased competition to provide transportation services throughout North America. Our well-distributed footprint of natural gas pipelines, particularly in the low-cost WCSB and the Appalachian basin, both of which are connected to North American demand centres, has placed us in a strong competitive position. Incumbent pipelines benefit from the connectivity and economies of scale afforded by the base infrastructure, as well as existing right-of-way and operational synergies given the increasing challenges of siting and permitting new pipeline construction and expansions. We have and will continue to offer competitive services to capture growing supply and North American demand that now includes access to global markets through LNG exports. Strategic priorities Our pipelines deliver the natural gas that millions of individuals and businesses across North America rely on for their energy needs. We are focused on capturing opportunities resulting from growing natural gas supply and connecting new markets while satisfying increasing demand for natural gas within existing markets. We are also focused on adapting our existing assets to changing natural gas flow dynamics and supporting our corporate-level sustainability commitments and targets. Our goal is to place all of our projects into service on time and on budget while ensuring the safety of our people, the environment and the general public impacted by the construction and operation of these facilities. In 2025, we will continue to focus on the execution of our existing capital program that includes completing construction on our Southeast Gateway pipeline in Mexico, advancing the Cedar Link project which is an expansion of the Coastal GasLink pipeline, investment in the NGTL System and the initiation and completion of new U.S. pipeline projects. We will remain focused on capital discipline as we continue to pursue the next wave of growth opportunities. Our marketing entities will complement our natural gas pipeline operations and generate non-regulated revenues by managing the procurement of natural gas supply and pipeline transportation capacity for natural gas customers within our pipeline corridors. 40 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines UNDERSTANDING OUR CANADIAN NATURAL GAS PIPELINES SEGMENT The Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines business is subject to regulation by various federal and provincial governmental agencies. The CER has jurisdiction over our regulated Canadian natural gas interprovincial pipeline systems, while provincial regulators have jurisdiction over pipeline systems operating entirely within a single province. All of our major Canadian natural gas pipeline assets are regulated by the CER with the exception of the Coastal GasLink pipeline, which was declared commercially in service in fourth quarter 2024 and is regulated by the BC Energy Regulator (formerly the BC Oil & Gas Commission). For the interprovincial natural gas pipelines it regulates, the CER approves tolls, facilities and services that are in the public interest and provide a reasonable opportunity for the pipeline to recover its costs to operate the pipeline. Included in the overall toll is a return on the investment we have made in the assets, referred to as the return on equity. Equity is generally 40 per cent of the deemed capital structure, with the remaining 60 per cent debt. Typically, tolls are based on the cost of providing service, including the cost of financing, divided by a forecast of volumes. Any variance in either costs or the actual volumes transported can result in an over-collection or under-collection of revenues that is normally trued up the following year in the calculation of the tolls for that period. The return on equity, however, would continue to be earned at the rate approved by the CER. Subject to approval by the CER, we and our customers can also establish settlement arrangements that may have elements that vary from the typical toll-setting process. Settlements can include longer terms and mechanisms such as incentive agreements that can have an impact on the actual return on equity achieved. Examples include fixing the OM&A component in determining revenue requirements where variances are to the pipeline's account or shared between the pipeline and shippers. The NGTL System operated under the previous five-year revenue requirement settlement for 2020-2024, which included an incentive mechanism for certain operating costs and the opportunity to increase depreciation rates if tolls fall below specified levels. As of January 1, 2025, the NGTL System is operating under a new five-year revenue requirement settlement. Refer to the Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines – Significant events section for additional information. The Canadian Mainline is operating under the 2021-2026 Mainline settlement, which includes an incentive to decrease costs and increase revenues. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS NGTL System In the year ended December 31, 2024, the NGTL System placed approximately $0.6 billion of capacity projects in service. 2023 NGTL System Intra-Basin Expansion The NGTL System Intra-Basin Expansion consists of 23 km (14 miles) of new pipeline and two new compressor stations. All assets have been placed in service, with a capital cost for the expansion of $0.5 billion. NGTL System Revenue Requirement Settlement and Multi-Year Growth Plan On September 26, 2024, the CER approved a five-year negotiated revenue requirement settlement on the NGTL System (2025-2029 NGTL Settlement) commencing on January 1, 2025. The 2025-2029 NGTL Settlement enables an investment framework that supports our Board of Directors' approval to allocate approximately $3.3 billion of capital towards progression of the MYGP for expansion facilities on the NGTL System. It is comprised of multiple distinct projects with targeted in-service dates between 2027 and 2030, subject to final company and regulatory approvals. The completion of the MYGP is expected to enable approximately 1.0 Bcf/d of incremental system throughput. This settlement maintains an ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity while increasing NGTL System depreciation rates, with an incentive that allows the NGTL System the opportunity to further increase depreciation rates if tolls fall below specified levels, or if growth projects are undertaken. It also introduces a new incentive mechanism to reduce both physical emissions and emissions compliance costs, which builds on the incentive mechanism for certain operating costs where variances from projected amounts and emissions savings are shared with our customers. A provision for review by customers exists in the settlement if tolls exceed a pre-determined level or if final company approvals of the MYGP are not obtained. Sale of Equity Interest in the NGTL System and Foothills Pipeline Assets The previously announced equity interest purchase agreement in respect of the sale by TC Energy of a 5.34 per cent interest in the NGTL System and Foothills Pipeline assets to an Indigenous-owned investment partnership was terminated by TC Energy on February 6, 2025. 46 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Valhalla North and Berland River Project The VNBR project will serve aggregate system requirements and connect migrating supply to key demand markets, designed to provide incremental capacity on the NGTL System of approximately 428 TJ/d (400 MMcf/d). With an estimated capital cost of $0.5 billion, the project consists of approximately 33 km (21 miles) of new pipeline, one new non-emitting electric compressor unit and associated facilities. Construction activities commenced in late 2024 with anticipated in-service dates commencing in second quarter 2026. Coastal GasLink Coastal GasLink Pipeline The Coastal GasLink pipeline is a 671 km (417 mile) pipeline that transports natural gas from a receipt point in the Dawson Creek area of British Columbia to LNG Canada's (LNGC) natural gas liquefaction facility near Kitimat, B.C. Transportation service on the pipeline is underpinned by 25-year TSAs (with renewal provisions) with each of the five LNGC participants (LNGC Participants). We hold a 35 per cent ownership interest in Coastal GasLink LP, the entity that owns the Coastal GasLink pipeline. Additionally, we hold a 100 per cent ownership interest in the general partner of Coastal GasLink LP, the entity that is contracted to develop, construct and operate the pipeline. The Coastal GasLink pipeline project achieved mechanical completion in 2023 and began delivering commissioning gas to the LNGC facility in late third quarter 2024. Post-construction reclamation activities are expected to be complete in 2025 and the project remains on track with its capital cost estimate of approximately $14.5 billion. Coastal GasLink LP continues to pursue cost recovery, including certain arbitration proceedings which involve claims by, and the defense of certain claims against, Coastal GasLink LP. With the exception of settlements made with respect to certain contractor disputes, these claims have not yet been conclusively determined, but our expectation is that these proceedings are likely to result in net cost recoveries. Refer to Note 31, Commitments, contingencies and guarantees, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. In June 2024, Coastal GasLink LP successfully completed a $7.15 billion refinancing of its existing construction credit facility through a private placement bond offering of senior secured notes to Canadian and U.S. investors. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay the majority of the outstanding $8.0 billion balance on Coastal GasLink LP’s construction credit facility. The remaining balance on the credit facility was settled through the use of proceeds from the unwinding of certain hedging arrangements associated with the construction facility. In November 2024, Coastal GasLink LP executed a commercial agreement with LNGC and LNGC Participants that declared commercial in-service for the pipeline, allowing for the collection of tolls from customers retroactive to October 1, 2024. The agreement also includes a one-time payment of $199 million from LNGC Participants to TC Energy in recognition of the completion of certain work and the final settlement of costs. The payment is to be made by LNGC Participants upon the earlier of three months after the declared in-service of the LNGC facility, or December 15, 2025. The payment accrues in full to TC Energy in accordance with the contractual terms between the Coastal GasLink LP partners and has been accounted for as an in-substance distribution from Coastal GasLink LP. In December 2024, following the commercial in-service of the pipeline, Coastal GasLink LP repaid the $3,147 million balance owing to TC Energy under the subordinated loan agreement. Our share of equity contributions required by Coastal GasLink LP to fund repayment of the loan amounted to $3,137 million. At December 31, 2024, our total share of partner equity contributions to fund the capital cost of the project was $5.3 billion. While unused capacity of $228 million remains available under the subordinated loan agreement, we do not anticipate that Coastal GasLink LP will draw on a significant portion of the remaining availability.

Cedar Link Expansion In June 2024, Coastal GasLink LP sanctioned the Cedar Link project following a positive FID for the construction of the Cedar LNG facility by the Cedar LNG joint venture partners, Haisla Nation and Pembina Pipeline Corporation. The Cedar LNG facility is a proposed floating liquefied natural gas facility to be constructed in Kitimat, British Columbia. The Cedar Link project is an expansion of the Coastal GasLink pipeline that is expected to enable delivery of up to 0.4 Bcf/d of natural gas to the Cedar LNG facility. With an estimated cost of $1.2 billion, the expansion project includes the addition of a new compressor station, connector pipeline and meter station to the existing Coastal GasLink pipeline infrastructure. Funding for the expansion will be provided through project-level credit facilities of up to $1.4 billion secured by Coastal GasLink LP in June 2024, equity funding to be provided by Coastal GasLink LP partners, including us, and the recovery of construction carrying costs from LNGC Participants who have elected to make payments on a quarterly basis throughout construction. The incremental funds available through the project-level credit facilities and recovery of carrying charges provide additional contingency to mitigate future funding requirements for Coastal GasLink LP should costs exceed initial estimates of $1.2 billion. TC Energy has entered into an equity contribution agreement to fund up to a maximum of $37 million for its proportionate share of the equity requirements related to the Cedar Link project. All major regulatory permits have been received and construction began in July 2024. The planned in-service date for the Cedar Link project is 2028, subject to the completion of plant commissioning activities at the Cedar LNG facility. Indigenous Equity Option In March 2022, we announced the signing of option agreements to sell up to a 10 per cent equity interest in Coastal GasLink LP to Indigenous communities across the project corridor, from our current 35 per cent equity ownership. The equity option is exercisable after commercial in-service of the Coastal GasLink pipeline, subject to customary regulatory approvals and consents, including the consent of LNGC. As a result of the commercial agreement with LNGC and LNGC Participants, which has allowed for an earlier commercial in-service than the LNGC plant, we are actively collaborating with the Indigenous communities to establish a mutually agreeable timeframe in which the option can be exercised. 48 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

In 2024, Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings were $2.0 billion compared to segmented losses of $0.1 billion and $1.4 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and included the following specific items, which have been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT: • a pre-tax gain on sale of non-core assets of $10 million in second quarter 2024 • a pre-tax impairment charge in 2023 of $2.1 billion (2022 – $3.0 billion) related to our equity investment in Coastal GasLink LP. Refer to Note 7, Coastal GasLink, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. Net income and comparable EBITDA for our rate-regulated Canadian natural gas pipelines are primarily affected by our approved ROE, investment base, the level of deemed common equity and incentive earnings. Changes in depreciation, financial charges and income taxes also impact comparable EBITDA, but do not have a significant impact on net income as they are almost entirely recovered in revenues on a flow-through basis.

Net income for the NGTL System increased by $5 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased by $62 million in 2023 compared to 2022 mainly due to a higher average investment base resulting from continued system expansions, partially offset by an incentive loss. The NGTL System was operating under the 2020-2024 Revenue Requirement Settlement, which included an approved ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity. This settlement provided the NGTL System the opportunity to increase depreciation rates if tolls fall below specified levels and an incentive mechanism for certain operating costs where variances from projected amounts are shared with our customers. Refer to the Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines - Significant events section for additional information on the 2025 - 2029 NGTL Settlement. Net income for the Canadian Mainline increased by $14 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased by $7 million in 2023 compared to 2022 mainly as a result of higher incentive earnings. The Canadian Mainline is operating under the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement, which includes an approved ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity and an incentive to decrease costs and increase revenues on the pipeline under a beneficial sharing mechanism with our customers. Comparable EBITDA Comparable EBITDA for Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines was $53 million higher in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the net effect of: • higher flow-through income taxes, depreciation and financial charges, as well as higher rate-base earnings on the NGTL System due to continued system expansions • higher flow-through income taxes, financial charges and depreciation, as well as higher rate-base earnings on Foothills primarily due to the NGTL System/Foothills West Path Delivery Program completed in 2023 • earnings from Coastal GasLink in 2023 related to the recognition of a $200 million incentive payment upon meeting certain milestones. Comparable EBITDA for Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines in 2023 was $529 million higher than 2022 primarily due to the net effect of: • higher flow-through financial charges, depreciation and income taxes, as well as higher rate-base earnings on the NGTL System • earnings from Coastal GasLink related to the recognition of a $200 million incentive payment upon meeting certain milestones, partially offset by lower development fee revenue resulting from timing of revenue recognition • higher flow-through depreciation, financial charges and higher incentive earnings, partially offset by lower flow-through income taxes on the Canadian Mainline. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization was $57 million higher in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily reflecting incremental depreciation on the NGTL System from expansion facilities that were placed in service. Depreciation and amortization was $127 million higher in 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher depreciation on the NGTL System from expansion facilities that were placed in service and on the Canadian Mainline due to assets placed in service on a section with higher depreciation rates per the terms of the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement. 50 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

OUTLOOK Comparable EBITDA and comparable earnings Net income for Canadian rate-regulated pipelines is affected by changes in investment base, ROE and deemed capital structure, as well as by the terms of toll settlements approved by the CER. Under the current regulatory model, earnings from Canadian rate-regulated natural gas pipelines are not materially affected by short-term fluctuations in the commodity price of natural gas, changes in throughput volumes or changes in contracted capacity levels. Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines comparable EBITDA in 2025 is expected to be higher than 2024 mainly due to higher contributions from the NGTL System resulting from the 2025-2029 NGTL Settlement. Due to the flow-through treatment of certain costs on our Canadian rate-regulated pipelines, changes in these costs can impact our comparable EBITDA despite having no significant effect on comparable earnings. We expect our comparable earnings in 2025 for the NGTL System and the Canadian Mainline to be consistent with 2024. Capital expenditures We incurred $1.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 in our Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines business on growth projects and maintenance capital expenditures. We expect to incur approximately $1.3 billion in 2025, primarily on NGTL System expansion projects and maintenance capital expenditures, all of which are immediately reflected in investment base and related earnings. We also made a net contribution of $0.6 billion to our investment in Coastal GasLink LP in 2024, which was declared commercially in service in fourth quarter 2024. Significant equity contributions are not anticipated in 2025. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 51

U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines UNDERSTANDING OUR U.S. NATURAL GAS PIPELINES SEGMENT The U.S. interstate natural gas pipeline business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local governmental agencies. FERC, however, has comprehensive jurisdiction over our U.S. interstate natural gas business. FERC approves maximum transportation rates that are cost-based and are designed to recover the pipeline's investment, operating expenses and a reasonable return for our investors. In the U.S., we have the ability to contract for negotiated or discounted rates with shippers. FERC does not require U.S. interstate pipelines to calculate rates annually, nor do they generally allow for the collection or refund of the variance between actual and expected revenues and costs into future years. This difference in U.S. regulation from the Canadian regulatory environment puts our U.S. pipelines at risk for the difference in expected and actual costs and revenues between rate cases. If revenues no longer provide a reasonable opportunity to recover our costs, we can file with FERC for a new determination of rates, subject to any moratorium in effect. Similarly, FERC or our shippers may institute proceedings to lower rates if they consider the return on capital invested to be unjust or unreasonable. Similar to Canada, we can also establish settlement arrangements with our U.S. shippers that are ultimately subject to approval by FERC. Rate case moratoriums for a period of time, before either we or the shippers can file for a rate review, are common for a settlement in that they provide some certainty for shippers in terms of rates, eliminate the costs associated with frequent rate proceedings for all parties and can provide an incentive for pipelines to lower costs. PHMSA Pipeline Safety Regulations Most of our U.S. natural gas pipeline systems are subject to federal pipeline safety statutes and regulations enacted and administered by PHMSA. PHMSA has recently and will continue to, produce new rules affecting numerous aspects of operation and maintenance of our pipeline system. PHMSA’s priorities are generally dictated by legislation which is influenced by numerous stakeholders and informed by learnings from recent industry incidents and stakeholder priorities. When PHMSA implements new rules, TC Energy seeks recovery of additional expenditures driven by such rules in future rate cases and modernization settlements. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS Portland Natural Gas Transmission System On March 4, 2024, we announced that TC Energy and its partner Northern New England Investment Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Énergir, entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell PNGTS to BlackRock, through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business, and investment funds managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners (the Purchaser). On August 15, 2024, we completed the sale of PNGTS for a gross purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion (US$1.1 billion), which included US$250 million of senior notes outstanding held at PNGTS and assumed by the Purchaser. A pre-tax gain of $572 million (US$408 million) and an after-tax gain of $456 million (US$323 million) were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024. We are providing customary transition services and will continue to work jointly with the Purchaser to facilitate the safe and orderly transition of this natural gas system. Refer to Note 30, Strategic alliance, acquisitions and dispositions, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. Gillis Access Project In March 2024, the Gillis Access project, a 68 km (42 mile) greenfield pipeline system that connects gas production sourced from the Gillis hub to downstream markets in southeast Louisiana, was placed in service. The capital cost of this project was approximately US$0.3 billion. In February 2023, we approved the 63 km (39 mile), 1.4 Bcf/d extension of the Gillis Access project to further connect supplies from Haynesville basin at Gillis. Effective September 1, 2024, all remaining shipper conditions have expired and the project expanded to 1.9 Bcf/d. The project has anticipated in-service dates starting in late 2026 and total estimated costs of US$0.4 billion. Columbia Gas Section 4 Rate Case In September 2024, Columbia Gas filed a Section 4 Rate Case with FERC requesting an increase to the maximum transportation rates expected to become effective April 1, 2025, subject to refund. We will pursue a collaborative process to find a mutually beneficial outcome with our customers through settlement. 52 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Southeast Virginia Energy Storage Project In November 2024, we approved the US$0.3 billion Southeast Virginia Energy Storage Project. This is an LNG peaking facility in southeast Virginia that will serve an existing LDC's growing winter peak day load and mitigate its peak day pricing exposure, as well as increase operational flexibility on the Columbia Gas system. The project has an anticipated in-service date of 2030. Pulaski and Maysville Projects In November 2024, we approved the Pulaski and Maysville projects on our Columbia Gulf System. These mainline extension projects off Columbia Gulf will facilitate full coal-to-gas conversion at two existing power plants and are each expected to provide 0.2 Bcf/d of capacity for incremental gas-fired generation. The projects have anticipated in-service dates in 2029 and total estimated costs of US$0.7 billion. GTN XPress Project In December 2024, the GTN XPress project, an expansion of the GTN system that will provide for the transport of incremental contracted export capacity facilitated by the NGTL System/Foothills West Path Delivery Program, was placed in service. The capital cost of this project was approximately US$0.1 billion. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 53

U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings in 2024 increased by $522 million compared to 2023 and increased by $914 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and included the following specific items, which have been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT: • a pre-tax gain of $572 million related to the sale of PNGTS on August 15, 2024 • a pre-tax gain on sale of a non-core asset of $38 million in second quarter 2024 • a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $571 million related to Great Lakes in first quarter 2022 • unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our U.S. natural gas marketing business. A stronger U.S. dollar in 2024 and 2023 had a positive impact on the Canadian dollar equivalent segmented earnings from our U.S. dollar-denominated operations. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. Earnings from our U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines operations are generally affected by contracted volume levels, volumes delivered and the rates charged, as well as by the cost of providing services. Columbia Gas and ANR results are also affected by the contracting and pricing of their natural gas storage capacity and incidental commodity sales. Natural gas pipeline and storage volumes and revenues are generally higher in the winter months because of the seasonal nature of the business. 54 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Page 57
Comparable EBITDA for U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines was US$46 million higher in 2024 than 2023 primarily due to the net effect of: • incremental earnings from growth and modernization projects placed in service, as well as increased earnings from additional contract sales on ANR and Great Lakes • increased equity earnings from Northern Border • decreased earnings due to higher operational costs, reflective of increased system utilization across our footprint • decreased earnings as a result of the sale of our 61.7 per cent equity interest in PNGTS, which was completed on August 15, 2024 • lower realized earnings related to our U.S. natural gas marketing business primarily due to lower margins • reduced earnings from our mineral rights business due to lower commodity prices. Comparable EBITDA for U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines was US$106 million higher in 2023 than 2022 primarily due to the net effect of: • incremental earnings from growth and modernization projects placed in service and additional contract sales on Columbia Gas, ANR and Great Lakes • a net increase in earnings from ANR following the FERC-approved settlement for higher transportation rates effective August 2022, partially offset by decreased earnings due to the sale of natural gas from certain gas storage facilities in 2022 • higher realized earnings related to our U.S. natural gas marketing business primarily due to higher margins • increased equity earnings from Iroquois and Northern Border • decreased earnings due to higher operational costs, reflective of increased system utilization across our footprint, as well as higher property taxes related to projects in service • reduced earnings from our mineral rights business due to lower commodity prices. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization was US$5 million higher in 2024 compared to 2023 and US$11 million higher in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in depreciation is primarily due to new projects placed in service, partially offset by the impact of the sale of PNGTS in 2024. OUTLOOK Comparable EBITDA Our U.S. natural gas pipelines are largely backed by long-term take-or-pay contracts that are expected to deliver stable and consistent financial performance. Our ability to retain customers and recontract or sell capacity at favourable rates is influenced by prevailing market conditions and competitive factors, including alternatives available to end-use customers in the form of competing natural gas pipelines and supply sources, as well as broader conditions that impact demand from certain customers or market segments. Comparable EBITDA is also affected by operational and other costs, which can be impacted by safety, environmental and other regulatory decisions, as well as customer credit risk. U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines comparable EBITDA in 2025 is expected to be slightly higher than 2024 due to an anticipated increase in transportation rates on Columbia Gas, which is dependent on the outcome of the Section 4 Rate Case filed with FERC. In addition, revenues are expected to increase following the completion of expansion projects in 2025 on the Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf and ANR systems, as well as full year in-service of the Gillis Access project. Our pipeline systems continue to see historically strong demand for service and we anticipate that during 2025, our assets will maintain the high utilization levels experienced in 2024. These positive results are expected to be partially offset by higher operational costs, reflective of continued increases to system utilization across our footprint, the impact of the sale of our 61.7 per cent equity interest in PNGTS in 2024 and an anticipated increase in property taxes from capital projects placed in service. Capital expenditures We incurred a total of US$2.2 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 on our U.S. natural gas pipelines and expect to incur approximately US$2.5 billion in 2025 primarily on our Columbia Gas, ANR and Columbia Gulf expansion projects and Bison XPress equity contributions, as well as Columbia Gas and ANR maintenance capital expenditures, the return on and recovery of which, is expected to be reflected in future tolls. We expect net capital expenditures in 2025 to be approximately US$2.0 billion after considering capital expenditures attributable to the non-controlling interests of entities we control.

Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines UNDERSTANDING OUR MEXICO NATURAL GAS PIPELINES SEGMENT For over a decade, Mexico has been undergoing a significant transition from fuel oil and diesel as its primary energy sources for electric generation to using natural gas. As a result, new natural gas pipeline infrastructure has been and continues to be required to meet the growing demand for natural gas. The CFE, Mexico's state-owned electric utility, is the primary counterparty on all of our existing pipelines under long-term contracts, which are predominately denominated in U.S. dollars. These fixed-rate contracts are generally designed to recover the cost of service and provide a return on and of invested capital. As the pipeline developer and operator, we are generally at risk for operating and construction costs. Our Mexico pipelines also have regulatory approved tariffs, services and related rates for other potential users. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS TGNH Strategic Alliance with the CFE In August 2022, we announced a strategic alliance with Mexico’s state-owned electric utility, the CFE, for the development of new natural gas infrastructure in central and southeast Mexico. In connection with the strategic alliance, we reached an FID to develop and construct the Southeast Gateway pipeline, a 1.3 Bcf/d, 715 km (444 mile) offshore natural gas pipeline to serve the southeast region of Mexico. We continue to be aligned with the CFE on finalizing the remaining project completion activities for achieving an in-service date of May 1, 2025. The estimated project cost for the Southeast Gateway pipeline is approximately US$3.9 billion, which is lower than the initial cost estimate of US$4.5 billion. During second quarter 2024, upon the CFE’s equity injection of US$340 million as well as non-cash consideration in recognition of the completion of certain contractual obligations, including land acquisition and permitting support, the CFE became a partner in TGNH with a 13.01 per cent equity interest. Provided that the CFE's contractual commitments are met related to land acquisition, community relations and permitting support, the CFE's equity in TGNH would build up to a maximum of 15 per cent with the in-service of the Southeast Gateway pipeline and will increase to approximately 35 per cent upon expiry of the contract in 2055. Refer to Note 30, Strategic alliance, acquisitions and dispositions, of our Consolidated financial statements for additional information. Tula In third quarter 2022, we placed the east section of the Tula pipeline into commercial service and we reached an agreement with the CFE to jointly develop and complete the remaining segments of the Tula pipeline, with the central segment subject to an FID. Due to the delay of an FID, recording AFUDC on the assets under construction for the Tula pipeline project was suspended in late 2023. Villa de Reyes We placed the north and lateral sections of the Villa de Reyes pipeline into commercial service in third quarter 2022 and third quarter 2023, respectively. We continue to work with our partner, the CFE, to complete the south section of the Villa de Reyes pipeline. The in-service date will be determined upon resolution of outstanding stakeholder issues. 56 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings in 2024 increased by $133 million compared to 2023 and increased by $305 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and included the impact of a $22 million unrealized recovery in 2024 (2023 – $80 million unrealized recovery; 2022 – $163 million unrealized loss) on the expected credit loss provision related to the TGNH net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico, which we have excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT. Refer to Note 28, Risk management and financial instruments, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. A stronger U.S. dollar in 2024 and 2023 had a positive impact on the Canadian dollar equivalent segmented earnings from our U.S. dollar-denominated operations in Mexico. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. Comparable EBITDA for Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines increased by US$134 million in 2024 compared to 2023 mainly due to the net effect of: • higher equity earnings in Sur de Texas primarily due to foreign exchange impacts upon the revaluation of peso-denominated liabilities as a result of a weaker Mexican peso and lower income tax expense mainly due to foreign exchange impacts. We use foreign exchange derivatives to manage this exposure, the impact of which is recognized in Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated statement of income. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information • lower earnings from Guadalajara primarily due to lower fixed revenue in accordance with the current transportation contract and higher operating costs. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 57

Page 60
Comparable EBITDA for Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines increased by US$19 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to: • higher earnings in TGNH primarily related to the commercial in-service of the north section of the Villa de Reyes pipeline and the east section of the Tula pipeline in third quarter 2022, as well as the commercial in-service of the lateral section of the Villa de Reyes pipeline in third quarter 2023 • lower earnings from Guadalajara primarily due to lower fixed revenue in accordance with the current transportation contract and higher operating costs associated with a disruption of service due to a weather event • lower equity earnings in Sur de Texas primarily due to foreign exchange impacts upon the revaluation of peso-denominated liabilities as a result of a stronger Mexican peso and increased interest expense due to higher interest rates. We use foreign exchange derivatives to manage this exposure, the impact of which is recognized in Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated statement of income. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization was generally consistent in 2024 compared to 2023. Depreciation and amortization was US$10 million lower in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the change to lease accounting for Tamazunchale subsequent to the execution of the TGNH TSA with the CFE in mid-2022. Under sales-type lease accounting, our in-service TGNH pipeline assets are reflected on our Consolidated balance sheet within net investment in leases with no depreciation expense being recognized. OUTLOOK Comparable EBITDA Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines comparable EBITDA reflects long-term, stable, principally U.S. dollar-denominated transportation contracts that are affected by the cost of providing service and includes our share of equity income from our 60 per cent equity interest in the Sur de Texas pipeline. Due to the long-term nature of the underlying transportation contracts, comparable EBITDA is generally consistent year-over-year except when new assets are placed in service. Comparable EBITDA for 2025 is expected to be higher than 2024 due to the Southeast Gateway project that is expected to be placed into commercial service on May 1, 2025. Capital expenditures We incurred US$1.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 primarily related to the construction of the Southeast Gateway and Villa de Reyes pipelines. We expect to incur approximately US$0.4 billion in 2025 to finalize construction of the Southeast Gateway and Villa de Reyes pipelines. 58 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

NATURAL GAS PIPELINES – BUSINESS RISKS The following are risks specific to our Natural Gas Pipelines business. Refer to page 102 for information about general risks related to TC Energy as a whole, including other operational, safety and financial risks, as well as our approach to risk management. Production levels within supply basins The NGTL System and our pipelines downstream depend largely on supply from the WCSB. Columbia Gas and its connecting pipelines largely depend on Appalachian supply. We continue to monitor any changes in our customers' natural gas production plans and how these may impact our existing assets and new project schedules. There is competition amongst pipelines to connect to major basins. An overall decrease in production and/or increased competition for supply could reduce throughput on our connected pipelines that, in turn, could negatively impact overall revenues generated. The WCSB and Appalachian basins are two of the most prolific and cost-competitive basins in North America and have considerable natural gas reserves. However, the amount actually produced depends on many variables including the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids, basin-on-basin competition, pipeline and gas-processing tolls, demand within the basin, changes in policy and regulations and the overall value of the reserves, including liquids content. Market access We compete for market share with other natural gas pipelines. New supply basins are being developed closer to markets we have historically served and may reduce the throughput and/or distance of haul on our existing pipelines and impact revenues. New markets, including those created by LNG export facilities developed to access global natural gas demand, can lead to increased revenues through higher utilization of existing facilities and/or demand for new infrastructure. The long-term competitiveness of our pipeline systems and the avoidance of bypass pipelines will depend on our ability to adapt to changing flow patterns by offering competitive transportation services to the market. As part of our annual strategic planning process, we evaluate the resilience of our asset portfolio over a range of potential energy supply and demand outcomes. Competition for greenfield pipeline expansion We face competition from other pipeline companies seeking to invest in greenfield natural gas pipeline development opportunities. This competition could result in fewer available projects that meet our investment hurdles or projects that proceed with lower overall financial returns. While renewable deployments are expected to garner an increasing portion of future energy needs, including in the power generation sector, aggregate natural gas demand across all sectors, including LNG exports, is still projected to grow under the most aggressive renewable deployment forecasts. The reliability of natural gas is an important factor in the successful wide-scale deployment of renewables with more intermittent capabilities. Demand for pipeline capacity Demand for pipeline capacity ultimately drives the sale of pipeline transportation services and is impacted by supply and market competition, variations in economic activity, weather variability, natural gas pipeline and storage competition, energy conservation, as well as demand for and prices of alternative sources of energy. Renewal of expiring contracts and the opportunity to charge a competitive toll depends on the overall demand for transportation service. A decrease in the level of demand for our pipeline transportation services could adversely impact revenues, although overall utilization of our pipeline capacity continues to grow and warrant further investment and expansion. Commodity prices The cyclical supply and demand nature of commodities and related pricing can have a secondary impact on our business where our shippers may choose to accelerate or delay certain projects. This can impact the timing of demand for transportation services and/or new natural gas pipeline infrastructure. Disruptions in the energy supply chain can result in price volatility and a decline in natural gas prices that could impact our shippers' financial condition and their ability to meet their transportation service cost obligations. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 59

Page 62
Regulatory risk Decisions and evolving policies by regulators and other government authorities, including changes in regulation, can impact the approval, timing, construction, operation and financial performance of our natural gas pipelines. There is a risk that decisions are delayed or are not favourable and could therefore adversely impact construction costs, in-service dates, anticipated revenues and the opportunity to further invest in our systems. There is also risk of a regulator disallowing recovery of a portion of our costs, now or at some point in the future. The regulatory approval process for larger infrastructure projects, including the time it takes to receive a decision, could be delayed or lead to an unfavourable decision due to evolving public opinion and government policy related to natural gas pipeline infrastructure development. If regulatory decisions are subsequently challenged in courts, this could result in further impacts to project costs and schedule delays. Increased scrutiny of construction and operations processes by the regulator or other enforcing agencies has the potential to delay construction, increase operating costs or require additional capital investment. There is a risk of an adverse impact to income if these costs are not fully recoverable and/or reduce the competitiveness of tolls charged to customers. We continuously manage these risks by monitoring legislative and regulatory developments and decisions to determine the possible impact on our natural gas pipelines business and developing rate, facility and tariff applications that account for and mitigate these risks where possible. Governmental risk Shifts in government policy or changes in government can impact our ability to grow our business. More complex regulatory processes, broader consultation requirements, more restrictive emissions and/or carbon pricing policies and changes to environmental regulations can impact our opportunities for continued growth. We are committed to working with all levels of government to ensure our business benefits and risks are understood and mitigation strategies are implemented. Construction and operations Constructing and operating our pipelines to ensure transportation services are provided safely and reliably is essential to the success of our business. Interruptions in our pipeline operations impacting throughput capacity may result in reduced revenues and can affect corporate reputation, as well as customer and public confidence in our operations. We manage this by investing in a highly skilled workforce, hiring third-party inspectors during construction, operating prudently, monitoring our pipeline systems continuously, using risk-based preventive maintenance programs and making effective capital investments. We use pipeline inspection equipment to regularly check the integrity of our pipelines and repair or replace sections when necessary. We also calibrate meters regularly to ensure accuracy and employ robust reliability and integrity programs to maintain compression equipment and safe and reliable operations. 60 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Power and Energy Solutions The Power and Energy Solutions business consists of power generation, non-regulated natural gas storage assets, as well as emerging technologies that can provide lower carbon solutions for our customers and industry. Our Power and Energy Solutions business includes approximately 4,650 MW of generation powered by nuclear, natural gas, wind and solar. These generation assets are generally supported by long-term contracts. Our Canadian power infrastructure assets are located in Alberta, Ontario, Québec and New Brunswick while our U.S. power infrastructure assets are located in Texas. Additionally, we have approximately 400 MW of PPAs in Canada and approximately 350 MW of PPAs in the U.S. from wind and solar facilities. We also own and operate approximately 118 Bcf of non-regulated natural gas storage capacity in Alberta. Strategy Our strategy is to maximize the value of our existing portfolio through maintaining safety and operational excellence while enhancing the life cycle and reliability of our assets and expanding profit margins through cost efficiency and revenue enhancement. Beyond our existing portfolio, we will focus our capital investment in sectors and projects that offer commercial frameworks consistent with TC Energy's value proposition, namely long-term contracts and rate regulation. In the long term, we believe there will be a growing need for a reliable supply of resources as the energy mix evolves. We are positioning ourselves to play a vital role in decarbonizing energy sources and will continue to build expertise and capabilities in emerging technologies and markets that we believe will fit these criteria in the future and have synergies with our natural gas business. Recent highlights • Bruce Power completed planned outages on Unit 1 and Unit 7 and completed a Vacuum Building inspection where Units 5, 6 and 8 were also shut down in 2024. On January 31, 2025, Unit 4 was removed from service to commence its MCR program • The Unit 5 MCR final cost and schedule estimate was submitted to the IESO on January 31, 2025 • Executed contract extensions of five years at Mackay River and 10 years at Grandview cogeneration plants • TC Energy and prospective partners Saugeen Ojibway Nation will advance pre-development work on the Ontario Pumped Storage Project following the Ontario Government's recent announcement on January 24, 2025 to invest up to $285 million. With the Ontario Government’s investment, the project can now advance critical development work, including the completion of a detailed cost estimate, the commencement of federal and provincial environmental assessments, advanced design and engineering and continued community engagement. It is expected that the Board of Directors, Saugeen Ojibway Nation and the Ontario Government will each make a final decision on the project following further definition and completion of a detailed cost estimate.

In Alberta we own five facilities: four natural gas-fired cogeneration and one solar. We exercise a disciplined operating strategy to maximize revenues. Our marketing group sells uncommitted power while also buying and selling power and natural gas to maximize earnings. To reduce commodity price exposure associated with uncontracted power, we sell a portion of this output in forward sales markets when acceptable contract terms are available while the remainder is retained to be sold in the spot market or under short-term forward arrangements. The objective of this strategy is to maintain adequate power supply to fulfill our sales obligations if we have unexpected plant outages and enable us to capture opportunities to increase earnings in periods of high spot prices. Our two eastern Canadian natural gas-fired cogeneration assets, Bécancour and Grandview, are fully contracted. Bruce Power Bruce Power is a nuclear power generation facility located near Tiverton, Ontario and is comprised of eight nuclear units with a combined capacity of approximately 6,580 MW. Bruce Power leases the facilities from OPG, has no spent fuel risk and will return the facilities to OPG for decommissioning at the end of the lease. We have a 48.3 per cent equity interest in Bruce Power. Results from Bruce Power will fluctuate primarily due to units being offline for the MCR program and the frequency, scope and duration of planned and unplanned maintenance outages. Through a long-term agreement with the IESO, Bruce Power has begun to progress a series of incremental life-extension investments to extend the operating life of the facility to 2064. This agreement represents an extension and material amendment to the earlier agreement that led to the refurbishment of Units 1 and 2 at the site. Under the amended agreement, which took economic effect in 2016, Bruce Power began investing in life extension activities for Units 3 through 8 to support the long-term refurbishment programs. Investment in the Asset Management program is designed to result in near-term life extensions of each of the six units up to the planned major refurbishment outages and beyond. The Asset Management program includes the one-time refurbishment or replacement of systems, structures or components that are not within the scope of the MCR program, which focuses on the actual replacement of the key, life-limiting reactor components. The MCR program is designed to add 30 years of operational life to each of the six units. The Unit 6 MCR, the first of the six-unit MCR life extension program, was completed in third quarter 2023. The Unit 3 MCR, the second unit in the MCR program, commenced in first quarter 2023 and has an expected completion in 2026. The Unit 4 MCR final cost and schedule estimate was approved by the IESO on February 8, 2024. Unit 4 was removed from service on January 31, 2025 to commence its MCR program with expected completion in 2028. Investments in the remaining three units' MCR programs are expected to continue through 2033. The Unit 5 MCR final cost and schedule estimate was submitted to the IESO on January 31, 2025. Future MCR investments will be subject to discrete decisions for each unit with specified off-ramps available for Bruce Power and the IESO. Along with the MCR life extension program, Bruce Power’s Project 2030 has a goal of achieving site peak output (capability) of 7,000 MW by 2033 in support of the province of Ontario's climate change targets and future clean energy needs. Project 2030 is focused on continued asset optimization, innovation and leveraging new technology, which could include integration with storage and other forms of energy, to increase site capability. Project 2030 is being implemented in three stages with the first two stages and Stage 3a fully approved for execution. The program commenced in 2019 with a site capability of 6,430 MW and closed out 2024 at approximately 6,580 MW; a net gain of approximately 150 MW. Upon completion of Stage 1, 2 and 3a, the site is projected to reach 6,840 MW. All three stages are being implemented in parallel to the MCR program. As part of the life extension and refurbishment agreement, Bruce Power receives a uniform contract price for all units which includes certain flow-through items such as fuel and lease expense recovery. The contract also provides for payment if the IESO requests a reduction in Bruce Power’s generation to balance the supply of and demand for, electricity and/or manage other operating conditions of the Ontario power grid. The amount of the reduction is considered deemed generation, for which Bruce Power is paid the contract price. 62 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Page 65
The contract price is subject to adjustments for the return of and on capital invested at Bruce Power under the Asset Management and MCR programs, along with various other pricing adjustments that allow for a better matching of revenues and costs over the long term. As part of the amended agreement, Bruce Power is also required to share operating cost efficiencies with the IESO for better than planned performance. These efficiencies are reviewed every three years and paid out on a monthly basis over the subsequent three-year period. No operating cost efficiencies for the 2022 to 2024 period have been provided for at December 31, 2024 and no operating cost efficiencies were realized for the 2019 to 2021 period. Bruce Power is a global supplier of Cobalt-60, a medical isotope used in the sterilization of medical equipment and to treat certain types of cancer. Cobalt-60 is produced during Bruce Power’s generation of electricity, harvested during certain planned maintenance outages and provided for medical use in the treatment of brain tumours and breast cancer. In addition, Bruce Power plans to expand Lutetium-177 isotope production used in the treatment of prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumours. This project was undertaken with a Canadian-based nuclear medicine partnership and the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, on whose traditional territory the Bruce Power facilities are located. Furthermore, Bruce Power and its partners in the production of medical isotopes have committed to building a hot cell facility in Bruce County, expediting their ability to process short-lived lutetium-177 to ensure it reaches cancer patients around the world in a timely fashion. Power Purchase Agreements – Canada We have approximately 400 MW of wind and solar generation PPAs and associated environmental attributes in Alberta. These PPAs allow us to generate incremental earnings by offering renewable power products to our customers. U.S. Power Power Generation & Marketing – U.S. We own approximately 300 MW of wind generation located in Texas which operate in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and Southwest Power Pool (SPP) markets. A portion of this power generation is sold under a long-term, fixed price contract. Our U.S. Power and emissions commercial trading and marketing business optimizes the value of our assets and leverages physical and financial products in the power and environmental markets with a focus on risk management. Power Purchase Agreements – U.S. We have approximately 350 MW of wind generation PPAs and associated environmental attributes in the U.S. These PPAs allow us to generate incremental earnings by offering renewable power products to our customers. Other Energy Solutions Canadian Natural Gas Storage We own and operate 118 Bcf of non-regulated natural gas storage capacity in Alberta. This business operates independently from our regulated natural gas transmission and U.S. storage businesses. Our Canadian natural gas storage business helps balance seasonal and short-term supply and demand while also adding flexibility to the delivery of natural gas to markets in Alberta and the rest of North America. Market volatility creates arbitrage opportunities and our natural gas storage facilities also give us and our customers the ability to capture value from short-term price movements. The natural gas storage business is affected by changes in seasonal natural gas price spreads which are generally determined by the differential in natural gas prices between the traditional summer injection and winter withdrawal seasons. In addition, the business may be affected by pipeline restrictions in Alberta which limit the ability to capture price differentials. Our natural gas storage business contracts with third parties, typically participants in the Alberta and interconnected gas markets, for a fixed fee to provide natural gas storage services on a short, medium and/or long-term basis. We also enter proprietary natural gas storage transactions which include a forward purchase of our own natural gas to be injected into storage and a simultaneous forward sale of natural gas for withdrawal at a later period, typically during the winter withdrawal season. By matching purchase and sales volumes on a back-to-back basis, we lock in future positive margins, effectively eliminating our exposure to changes in natural gas prices for these transactions.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS Bruce Power Life Extension On January 31, 2025, Unit 4 was removed from service to commence its MCR program, with a return to service expected in 2028. The Unit 5 MCR final cost and schedule estimate was submitted to the IESO on January 31, 2025. Uprate Initiative On November 19, 2024, we announced that Bruce Power is progressing with Stage 3a of Project 2030, which is designed to provide incremental capacity of approximately 90 MW at the site. TC Energy’s share of the capital required is approximately $175 million. Bruce Power will not be requesting an incremental capital call for this stage. By optimizing its existing Units through this program, when complete, Project 2030 is expected to increase the Bruce Power site peak output to 7,000 MW. All of this output will be sold under Bruce Power’s long-term contract with the IESO. Ontario Pumped Storage TC Energy and prospective partners Saugeen Ojibway Nation will advance pre-development work on the Ontario Pumped Storage Project following the Ontario Government's recent announcement on January 24, 2025 to invest up to $285 million. With the Ontario Government’s investment, the project can now advance critical development work, including the completion of a detailed cost estimate, the commencement of federal and provincial environmental assessments, advanced design and engineering and continued community engagement. It is expected that TC Energy's Board of Directors, Saugeen Ojibway Nation and the Ontario Government will each make a final decision on the project following further definition and completion of a detailed cost estimate. 66 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Refer to the Corporate - Financial results section for additional information. Power and Energy Solutions segmented earnings increased by $98 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased by $171 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and included the following specific items, which have been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT: • a pre-tax impairment charge of $36 million related to development costs incurred on Project Tundra, a next-generation technology carbon capture and storage project, following our decision to end our collaboration on the project • our proportionate share of Bruce Power's unrealized gains and losses on funds invested for post-retirement benefits and risk management activities • unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce commodity exposures. Comparable EBITDA for Power and Energy Solutions increased by $194 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the net effect of: • higher contributions from Bruce Power primarily due to higher generation resulting from fewer outage days in 2024 and a higher contract price, partially offset by increased operating expenses and higher depreciation expense. Additional financial and operating information on Bruce Power is provided below • increased Natural Gas Storage and other results primarily due to higher realized Alberta natural gas storage spreads and higher contributions from our U.S. marketing business, partially offset by increased business development costs in 2024 • decreased Canadian Power financial results primarily from lower realized power prices, partially offset by lower natural gas fuel costs. Comparable EBITDA for Power and Energy Solutions increased by $113 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the net effect of: • higher contributions from Bruce Power primarily due to a higher contract price, reduced outage costs with fewer planned outage days and lower depreciation expense, partially offset by lower generation and increased operating expenses • increased Canadian Power financial results primarily from lower natural gas fuel costs and higher realized power prices • decreased Natural Gas Storage and other results due to increased business development costs. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization increased by $9 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased by $20 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and were primarily due to the acquisition of the Texas Wind Farms in the first half of 2023.

Bruce Power results Bruce Power results reflect our proportionate share. Comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT are non-GAAP measures. Refer to page 24 for more information on non-GAAP measures we use. The following is our proportionate share of the components of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT. year ended December 31 (millions of $, unless otherwise noted) 2024 2023 2022 Items included in comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT are comprised of: Revenues 1 2,242 1,941 1,848 Operating expenses (984) (917) (924) Depreciation and other (368) (344) (372) Comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT 2 890 680 552 Bruce Power – other information Plant availability 3,4 92% 92% 86% Planned outage days 4 160 106 302 Unplanned outage days 32 62 34 Sales volumes (GWh) 5 22,209 20,447 20,610 Realized power price per MWh 6 $100 $94 $89 1 Net of amounts recorded to reflect operating cost efficiencies shared with the IESO, if applicable. 2 Represents our 48.3 per cent ownership interest and internal costs supporting our investment in Bruce Power. Excludes unrealized gains and losses on funds invested for post-retirement benefits and risk management activities. 3 The percentage of time the plant was available to generate power, regardless of whether it was running. 4 Excludes MCR outage days. 5 Sales volumes include deemed generation. 6 Calculation based on actual and deemed generation. Realized power price per MWh includes realized gains and losses from contracting activities and cost flow-through items. Excludes unrealized gains and losses on contracting activities and non-electricity revenues. Bruce Power's 2024 planned maintenance, on Units 5 to 8, excluding the MCR program, was completed in second quarter. A planned outage on Unit 4 was completed in second quarter 2023 and on Unit 8 in fourth quarter 2023. In 2022, planned maintenance was completed on all units. OUTLOOK Comparable EBITDA Power and Energy Solutions comparable EBITDA in 2025 is expected to be lower than 2024 primarily from decreased Bruce Power equity income due to the removal of Unit 4 from service on January 31, 2025 to commence its MCR outage, partially offset by a higher contract price and fewer non-MCR planned outage days. Lower Alberta power prices and higher natural gas prices in 2025 are expected to reduce contributions from Canadian Power. These reductions are expected to be partially offset by lower business development activities in 2025. Planned maintenance at Bruce Power in 2025 is currently scheduled to begin on Unit 5 in the first quarter and on Unit 2 in the third quarter. The average 2025 plant availability percentage, excluding the Unit 3 and Unit 4 MCR programs, is expected to be in the low-90 per cent range. Capital expenditures We incurred $0.8 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 primarily on our share of the Unit 3 MCR program at Bruce Power and maintenance capital projects across the segment. We expect to incur approximately $0.9 billion in 2025 primarily related to our share of Bruce Power's Unit 3 and Unit 4 MCR programs. 68 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

BUSINESS RISKS The following are risks specific to our Power and Energy Solutions business. Refer to page 102 for information about general risks related to TC Energy as a whole, including other operational, safety and financial risks, as well as our approach to risk management. Fluctuating power and natural gas market prices Much of the physical power generation and fuel used in our power operations is currently exposed to commodity price volatility. These exposures are partially mitigated through long-term contracts and hedging activities including selling and purchasing power and natural gas in forward markets. As contracts expire, new contracts are entered into at prevailing market prices. Our two eastern Canadian natural gas-fired assets are fully contracted and not materially impacted by fluctuating spot power and natural gas prices. As the contracts on these assets expire it is uncertain if we will be able to re-contract on similar terms and may face future commodity exposure. Our natural gas storage business is subject to fluctuating seasonal natural gas price spreads which are generally determined by the differential in natural gas prices between the traditional summer injection and winter withdrawal seasons. In addition, the business may be affected by pipeline restrictions in Alberta which limit the ability to capture price differentials. Plant availability Operating our plants to ensure services are provided safely and reliably as well as optimizing and maintaining their availability are essential to the continued success of our Power and Energy Solutions business. Unexpected outages or extended planned outages at our power plants can increase maintenance costs as well as lower plant output, revenues and margins. We may also have to buy power or natural gas on the spot market to meet our delivery obligations. We manage this risk by investing in a highly skilled workforce, operating prudently, running comprehensive risk-based preventive maintenance programs and making effective capital investments. Regulatory We operate in Canada and the U.S. in both regulated and deregulated power markets. These markets are subject to various federal, provincial and state regulations. As power markets evolve, there is the potential for regulatory bodies to implement new rules that could negatively affect us as a generator and marketer of electricity. These may be in the form of market rule or market design changes, changes in the interpretation and application of market rules by regulators, price caps, emission controls, emissions costs, cost allocations to generators and out-of-market actions taken by others to build excess generation, all of which may negatively affect the price of power. In addition, our development projects rely on an orderly permitting process and any disruption to that process can have negative effects on project schedules and costs. We are an active participant in formal and informal regulatory proceedings and take legal action where required. Compliance Market rules, regulations and operating standards apply to our power business based on the jurisdictions in which they operate. Our trading and marketing activities may be subject to fair competition and market conduct requirements as well as specific rules that apply to physical and financial transactions in deregulated markets. Similarly, our generators may be subject to specific operating and technical standards relating to maintenance activities, generator availability and delivery of power and power-related products. While significant efforts are made to ensure we comply with all applicable statutory requirements, situations including unforeseen operational challenges, lack of rule clarity and the ambiguous and unpredictable application of requirements by regulators and market monitors occasionally arise and create compliance risk. Deemed contravention of these requirements may result in mandatory mitigation activities, monetary penalties, imposition of operational limitations, or even prosecution. Weather Significant changes in temperature and weather, including the potential impacts of climate change, have many effects on our business, ranging from the impact on demand, availability and commodity prices, to efficiency and output capability. Extreme temperature and weather can affect market demand for power and natural gas and can lead to significant price volatility, as well as restrict the availability of natural gas and power if demand is higher than supply. Fluctuations in seasonal weather patterns or temperature can affect the efficiency and production of our natural gas-fired power plants. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 69

Page 72
Competition We face various competitive forces that impact our existing assets and prospects for growth. For instance, our existing power plants will compete over time with new power capacity. New supply could come in several forms including supply that employs more efficient power generation technologies or additional supply from regional power transmission interconnections. We also face competition from other power companies in Canada and the U.S., as well as in the development of greenfield power plants. Traditional and non-traditional participants are entering the growing lower-carbon economy in North America and, as a result, we face competition in building lower-carbon energy solutions. Execution and capital costs We make substantial capital commitments developing power generation infrastructure based on the assumption that these assets will deliver an attractive return on investment. While we carefully consider the scope and expected costs of our capital projects, we are exposed to execution and capital cost overrun risk which may impact our return on these projects. We mitigate this risk by implementing comprehensive project governance and oversight processes and through the structuring of engineering, procurement and construction contracts with reputable counterparties. 70 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Corporate SIGNIFICANT EVENTS NGTL System Ownership Transfer On April 1, 2024, ownership of the NGTL System was transferred from Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. to NGTL GP Ltd. on behalf of NGTL Limited Partnership as part of an ordinary course corporate reorganization to support business optimization and facilitate future minority ownership of the NGTL System, including participation from Indigenous groups. Refer to the Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines – Significant events section for additional information. The reorganization will not impact the operations of the NGTL System. As a limited partnership, NGTL LP is not subject to Canadian corporate income taxes. The related income tax obligations are those of the partners. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred costs of $42 million after tax related to the NGTL System Ownership Transfer, which has been excluded from comparable measures. 2016 Columbia Pipeline Acquisition Lawsuit In 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court (the Court) issued its decision in the class action lawsuit commenced by former shareholders of Columbia Pipeline Group Inc. (CPG) related to the acquisition of CPG by TC Energy in 2016. The Court found that the former CPG executives breached their fiduciary duties, that the former CPG Board breached its duty of care in overseeing the sale process and that TC Energy aided and abetted those breaches. On May 15, 2024, the Court allocated responsibility for the total sale process damages of US$398 million in the amount of 50 per cent to the former Columbia CEO and CFO, collectively, and 50 per cent to TC Energy. Pursuant to the Final Order and Judgment (Final Judgment), TC Energy’s allocated share of the sale process claim damages is US$199 million, plus US$153 million in interest as of June 14, 2024. The Court also entered judgment related to a disclosure claim for which TC Energy’s allocated share of damages is US$84 million, plus US$64 million in interest as of June 14, 2024. The damages for the two claims are not cumulative and TC Energy would only be required to pay the greater of the sale process damages and disclosure claim damages after final determination of those amounts on appeal, including any additional interest assessed to the date of payment. TC Energy disagrees with many of the Court’s findings and believes the Court’s ruling departs from established Delaware law. TC Energy has filed a notice of appeal, which is scheduled to be heard by the Delaware Supreme Court on March 12, 2025. A final decision is expected in mid-2025. During the appeal process, in lieu of paying the judgment, TC Energy posted an appeal bond in the amount of US$380 million, which approximates the amount of the Final Judgment plus nine months of post-judgment interest. Our legal assessment is that it is not probable that TC Energy will incur a loss upon completion of the appeal process, and therefore, we have not accrued a provision for this claim at December 31, 2024. Focus Project In late 2022, we launched the Focus Project to identify opportunities to improve safety, productivity and cost-effectiveness. To date, we have designed and implemented a broad set of initiatives to further enhance safety, as well as improve operational and financial performance over the long term. The expected impacts of project initiatives have been included in our outlook for 2025 and no significant incremental project costs are expected beyond 2024. The program will wind down in 2025 as we finalize implementation of certain initiatives. The core elements of the project are embedded into our business processes to sustain performance improvements over the long term. For the year ended December 31, 2024 we have incurred pre-tax costs of $45 million (2023 – $124 million) for the Focus Project primarily related to severance costs, of which $24 million (2023 – $65 million, primarily external consulting) was recorded in Plant operating costs and other in the Consolidated statement of income and was excluded from comparable measures. An additional $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 (2023 – $23 million) was recorded in Plant operating costs and other with offsetting revenues related to costs recoverable through regulatory and commercial tolling structures, the net effect of which had no impact on net income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, $7 million (2023 – $36 million) was allocated to capital projects. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 71

Asset Divestiture Program Our asset divestiture program, which included completing the sale of PNGTS and the CFE’s equity injection resulting in a 13.01 per cent equity interest in TGNH in 2024, as well as the sale of a 40 per cent non-controlling equity interest in Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf in 2023, collectively contributed to our deleveraging goal. Any further capital rotation opportunities will be assessed in the normal course of our business. 2024 Canadian Legislation On June 20, 2024, two pieces of Canadian legislation, Bill C-59 and Bill C-69 were enacted into law, which, among other things, included the excessive interest and financing expenses limitation (EIFEL) rules and the Global Minimum Tax Act. We do not expect a material impact on our financial performance and cash flows as a result of the new legislation. TC Energy has disallowed interest expense related to the EIFEL legislation and expects further restrictions on interest deductibility. However, through on-going monitoring and management, we expect the disallowed interest to be utilized. We will also continue to monitor developments related to EIFEL legislation and assess its impacts to the business. 72 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Refer to the Other information - Financial risks and financial instruments sections for additional information. Interest expense included in comparable earnings in 2024 increased by $210 million compared to 2023 primarily due to the net effect of: • long-term debt issuances and maturities • interest expense allocated to discontinued operations for nine months in 2024 compared to a full year in 2023. Refer to the Discontinued operations section for additional information • the foreign exchange impact from a stronger U.S. dollar on translation of U.S. dollar-denominated interest expense • reduced levels of short-term borrowing. Interest expense included in comparable earnings in 2023 increased by $666 million compared to 2022 mainly due to the net effect of: • long-term debt issuances and maturities • the foreign exchange impact from a stronger U.S. dollar on translation of U.S. dollar-denominated interest expense • higher interest rates on our long-term debt that bears interest at a floating rate • higher capitalized interest, largely due to funding related to our investment in Coastal GasLink LP.

The decrease in Canadian dollar-denominated AFUDC is primarily related to NGTL System expansion projects placed in service. The increase in U.S. dollar-denominated AFUDC is primarily due to capital expenditures on the Southeast Gateway pipeline project and U.S. natural gas pipeline projects in 2024, partially offset by the suspension of AFUDC on the assets under construction for the Tula pipeline project due to the delay of an FID and placing the lateral section of Villa de Reyes pipeline in service in August 2023. AFUDC increased by $206 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in Canadian dollar-denominated AFUDC is primarily related to NGTL System expansion projects placed in service. The increase in U.S. dollar-denominated AFUDC is the result of the reactivation of AFUDC on the TGNH assets under construction following the new TSA with the CFE, as well as capital expenditures on the Southeast Gateway pipeline project in 2023, partially offset by projects placed in service on our U.S. natural gas pipelines. Effective November 1, 2023, AFUDC was suspended on the assets under construction for the Tula pipeline project, due to the delay of an FID.

Foreign exchange losses, net included in comparable earnings were $85 million in 2024 compared to foreign exchange gains, net of $118 million in 2023. The change was primarily due to the net effect of: • risk management activities used to manage our foreign exchange exposure to net liabilities in Mexico and to U.S. dollar‑denominated income • foreign exchange gains in 2024 compared to foreign exchange losses in 2023 on the revaluation of our peso-denominated net monetary liabilities to U.S. dollars • a net realized gain in the second quarter 2024 on the partial repayment of the peso-denominated intercompany loan between TCPL and TGNH. Foreign exchange gains, net included in comparable earnings were $118 million in 2023 compared to foreign exchange losses, net of $8 million in 2022. The change was primarily due to the net effect of: • risk management activities used to manage our foreign exchange exposure to net liabilities in Mexico and to U.S. dollar‑denominated income • higher foreign exchange losses on the revaluation of our peso-denominated net monetary liabilities to U.S. dollars.

Foreign exchange Foreign exchange related to U.S. dollar-denominated operations Certain of our businesses generate all or most of their earnings in U.S. dollars and, since we report our financial results in Canadian dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar directly affect our comparable EBITDA and may also impact comparable earnings. As our U.S. dollar-denominated operations continue to grow, this exposure increases. A portion of the U.S. dollar-denominated comparable EBITDA exposure is naturally offset by U.S. dollar-denominated amounts below comparable EBITDA within Depreciation and amortization, Interest expense and other income statement line items. A portion of the remaining exposure is actively managed on a rolling forward basis up to three years using foreign exchange derivatives; however, the natural exposure beyond that period remains. The net impact of the U.S. dollar movements on comparable earnings during the year ended December 31, 2024, after considering natural offsets and economic hedges, was not significant. The components of our financial results denominated in U.S. dollars are set out in the table below, including our U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines and Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines operations. Comparable EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

These inter-affiliate loans were fully repaid in 2022. Foreign exchange related to Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines Changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar can affect our comparable earnings as a portion of our Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines monetary assets and liabilities are peso-denominated, while our financial results are denominated in U.S. dollars for our Mexico operations. These peso-denominated balances are revalued to U.S. dollars, creating foreign exchange gains and losses that are included in Income (loss) from equity investments, Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net and Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in the Consolidated statement of income. In addition, foreign exchange gains or losses calculated for Mexico income tax purposes on the revaluation of U.S. dollar‑denominated monetary assets and liabilities result in a peso‑denominated income tax exposure for these entities, leading to fluctuations in Income from equity investments and Income tax expense. This exposure increases as our U.S. dollar‑denominated net monetary liabilities grow. The above exposures are managed using foreign exchange derivatives, although some unhedged exposure remains. The impacts of the foreign exchange derivatives are recorded in Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated statement of income.

Financial condition We strive to maintain financial strength and flexibility in all parts of the economic cycle. We rely on our operating cash flows to sustain our business, pay dividends and fund a portion of our growth. In addition, we access capital markets and engage in portfolio management activities to meet our financing needs and to manage our capital structure and credit ratings. More information on how our credit ratings can impact our financing costs, liquidity and operations is available in our Annual Information Form available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca). We believe we have the financial capacity to fund our existing capital program through predictable and growing cash flows from continuing operations, access to capital markets, portfolio management activities, joint ventures, asset-level financing, cash on hand and substantial committed credit facilities. Annually, in the fourth quarter, we renew and extend our credit facilities as required. Financial Plan Our capital program is comprised of approximately $25 billion of secured projects, as well as our projects under development, which are subject to key corporate and regulatory approvals. As discussed throughout this Financial condition section, our capital program is expected to be financed through our growing internally-generated cash flows and a combination of other funding options which may include: • senior debt • hybrid securities • preferred shares • asset divestitures and capital rotation • project financing • potential involvement of strategic or financial partners. In addition, we may access additional funding options, as deemed appropriate, including common shares issued from treasury under our DRP and discrete common equity issuances. Balance sheet analysis - from continuing operations At December 31, 2024, excluding discontinued operations, our current assets totaled $5.5 billion and current liabilities amounted to $10.3 billion, leaving us with a working capital deficit of $4.8 billion compared to $0.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Our working capital deficiency is considered to be in the normal course of business and is managed through: • our ability to generate predictable and growing cash flows from operations • a total of $8.0 billion of committed revolving credit facilities available for short-term borrowing capacity, of which $7.6 billion of short-term borrowing capacity remains available, net of $0.4 billion backstopping outstanding commercial paper balances. We also have arrangements in place for a further $2.0 billion of demand credit facilities on which $1.1 billion remains available as of December 31, 2024 • additional $2.2 billion committed revolving credit facilities at certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, on which no amounts have been drawn • our access to capital markets, including through securities issuances, incremental credit facilities, capital rotation and DRP, if deemed appropriate. Our total assets from continuing operations at December 31, 2024 were $117.9 billion compared to $109.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects our capital spending program, increased equity investments and a stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 on translation of our U.S. dollar-denominated assets, partially offset by depreciation and working capital. At December 31, 2024 our total liabilities from continuing operations were $79.6 billion, compared to $82.1 billion at December 31, 2023 due to the net effect of a reduction in debt, working capital and a stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 on translation of our U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities.

This is offset by a corresponding deferred tax recovery resulting in no net impact to tax expense. Net cash provided by operations Net cash provided by operations increased by $428 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher funds generated from operations. Net cash provided by operations increased by $893 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the amount and timing of working capital changes and higher funds generated from operations. Comparable funds generated from operations Comparable funds generated from operations, a non-GAAP measure, helps us assess the cash generating ability of our businesses by excluding the timing effects of working capital changes, as well as the cash impact of our specific items. Comparable funds generated from operations decreased by $90 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower comparable earnings, partially offset by increased distributions from our equity investments. Comparable funds generated from operations increased by $627 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher comparable EBITDA, increased distributions from our equity investments, higher interest earned on short-term investments and net realized gains on derivatives used to manage our foreign exchange exposures, partially offset by higher interest expense.

Capital expenditures Capital expenditures in 2024 were incurred primarily for the advancement of the Southeast Gateway pipeline, Columbia Gas and ANR projects, the NGTL System expansion as well as maintenance capital expenditures. Lower capital expenditures in 2024 compared to 2023 reflect reduced spending on NGTL System expansion and the Southeast Gateway pipeline. Capital projects in development Costs incurred during 2024 on Capital projects in development were primarily attributable to spending on projects in the Power and Energy Solutions segment. Contributions to equity investments Contributions to equity investments decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 mainly due to lower funds advanced to Coastal GasLink LP through the subordinated loan agreement. On December 17, 2024, following the declared commercial in-service of the pipeline, Coastal GasLink LP repaid the $3,147 million balance owing to us under the subordinated loan agreement. Our share of equity contributions required to fund Coastal GasLink LP's repayment of the outstanding loan balance amounted to $3,137 million. The Contributions to equity investments and Other distributions from equity investments with respect to these activities are presented above on a net basis, although they are reported on a gross basis in our Consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 7, Coastal GasLink, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. Contributions to equity investments increased in 2023 compared to 2022 mainly due to the draws of $2,520 million on the subordinated loan by Coastal GasLink LP in 2023 which were accounted for as in-substance equity contributions. As part of refinancing activities with the Sur de Texas joint venture, on March 15, 2022, our peso-denominated inter-affiliate loan was fully repaid upon maturity in the amount of $1.2 billion and was subsequently replaced with a new U.S. dollar-denominated inter-affiliate loan of an equivalent $1.2 billion.

Refer to the Other Information – Related party transactions section for additional information. Proceeds from sales of assets In 2024, TC Energy and its partner, Northern New England Investment Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Énergir, completed the sale of PNGTS to a third party. Our share of the proceeds was $743 million (US$546 million), net of transaction costs. In 2024, we also completed the sale of other non-core assets for gross proceeds of $48 million. In 2023, we completed the sale of a 20.1 per cent equity interest in Port Neches Link LLC to its joint venture partner, Motiva Enterprises, for gross proceeds of $33 million (US$25 million). As part of the Spinoff Transaction on October 1, 2024, our remaining interest in Port Neches Link LLC was transferred to South Bow. Other distributions from equity investments Other distributions from equity investments primarily relate to distributions from Millennium as a result of its debt financing program in 2024, as well as the return of capital from our equity investment in Iroquois. In 2022, other distributions from equity investments primarily relates to our proportionate share of the Sur de Texas debt repayments. Subsequent to the refinancing activities with the joint venture discussed above, on July 29, 2022, the joint venture entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with third parties, the proceeds of which were used to fully repay the U.S. dollar-denominated inter-affiliate loan with TC Energy. Acquisitions In 2023, we acquired 100 per cent of the Class B Membership Interests in the Fluvanna Wind Farm located in Scurry County, Texas for US$99 million, before post-closing adjustments. We also acquired 100 per cent of the Class B Membership Interests in the Blue Cloud Wind Farm located in Bailey County, Texas for US$125 million, before post-closing adjustments. Loans to affiliate Loans to affiliate (issued) repaid, net, represent issuances and repayments on the subordinated demand revolving credit facility and the subordinated loan agreement that we entered with Coastal GasLink LP to provide additional liquidity and funding to the Coastal GasLink project.

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $12.0 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower issuances and higher repayments of long-term debt, the receipt of the $5.3 billion (US$3.9 billion) proceeds in 2023 upon sale of a 40 per cent non-controlling equity interest in Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf, as well as higher dividends and distributions paid in 2024, partially offset by net issuances of notes payable in 2024 compared to net repayments in 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $7.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher net issuances of long-term debt and repayments of notes payable, as well as the receipt of the $5.3 billion (US$3.9 billion) proceeds upon sale of a 40 per cent non-controlling equity interest in Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf.

Refer to the Discontinued operations section for additional information. In October 2024, TCPL commenced and completed our cash tender offers to purchase and cancel certain senior unsecured notes and medium term notes at a 7.73 per cent weighted average discount. In addition, the Company repaid and retired outstanding callable notes at par. These extinguishments of debt resulted in a pre-tax net gain of $228 million, primarily due to the fair value discount and recognition of unamortized debt issue costs related to these notes. The net gain on debt extinguishment was recorded in Interest expense, in the Consolidated statement of income and has been excluded from comparable measures. For more information about long-term debt and junior subordinated notes issued and long-term debt repaid in 2024, 2023 and 2022, refer to the notes to our 2024 Consolidated financial statements.

Commencing with the dividends payable on January 31, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2024, the amounts reflect TC Energy’s proportionate allocation following the Spinoff Transaction. Refer to the Discontinued operations section for additional information. On February 14, 2025, we announced a quarterly dividend on our outstanding common shares of $0.85 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, which represents an increase of 3.3 per cent from TC Energy's proportionate allocation of the dividend following the Spinoff Transaction. This equates to an annual dividend of $3.40 per common share. Credit facilities We have several committed credit facilities that support our commercial paper programs and provide short-term liquidity for general corporate purposes. In addition, we have demand credit facilities that are also used for general corporate purposes, including issuing letters of credit and providing additional liquidity. At February 7, 2025, total committed revolving and demand credit facilities were $12.2 billion.

Some of our operating leases include the option to renew the agreement for one to 25 years. 3 Includes an estimated $110 million related to the transfer of pension assets to South Bow. The final transfer will be adjusted for investment returns and benefit payments from October 1, 2024, to the transfer date. Refer to the Obligations - pension and other post-retirement benefit plans section for more information. Notes payable Total notes payable outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $387 million (2023 – nil). Long-term debt and junior subordinated notes At December 31, 2024, we had $47.9 billion (2023 – $52.9 billion) of long-term debt and $11.0 billion (2023 – $10.3 billion) of junior subordinated notes. We attempt to ladder the maturity profile of our debt. The weighted-average maturity of our junior subordinated notes and long‑term debt, excluding call features is approximately 18 years. At December 31, 2024, scheduled interest payments related to our long-term debt and junior subordinated notes were as follows: at December 31, 2024 Total < 1 year 1 - 3 years 4 - 5 years > 5 years (millions of $) Long-term debt 25,071 2,379 4,308 3,729 14,655 Junior subordinated notes 50,755 660 1,557 1,742 46,796 75,826 3,039 5,865 5,471 61,451 Purchase obligations We have purchase obligations that are transacted at market prices and in the normal course of business, including long-term natural gas transportation and purchase arrangements. Capital expenditure commitments include obligations related to the construction of growth projects and are based on the projects proceeding as planned. Changes to these projects, including cancellation, would reduce or possibly eliminate these commitments as a result of cost mitigation efforts. We have entered into PPAs with solar and wind-power generating facilities ranging from 2025 to 2038, that require the purchase of generated energy and associated environmental attributes. At December 31, 2024, the total planned capacity secured under the PPAs is approximately 750 MW with the generation subject to operating availability and capacity factors. These PPAs do not meet the definition of a lease or derivative. Future payments and their timing cannot be reasonably estimated as they are dependent on when certain underlying facilities are placed in service and the amount of energy generated. Certain of these purchase commitments have offsetting sale PPAs for all or a portion of the related output from the facility. 90 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

GUARANTEES Sur de Texas We and our partner on the Sur de Texas pipeline, IEnova, have jointly guaranteed the financial performance of the entity which owns the pipeline. Such agreements include a guarantee and a letter of credit which are primarily related to the delivery of natural gas. The guarantee has terms that can be renewed in June 2025, with the annual option to extend for one year periods ending in 2053. At December 31, 2024, our share of potential exposure under the Sur de Texas pipeline guarantees was estimated to be $93 million with a carrying amount of less than $1 million. Bruce Power We and our joint venture partner on Bruce Power, BPC Generation Infrastructure Trust, have each severally guaranteed certain contingent financial obligations of Bruce Power related to a lease agreement. The Bruce Power guarantee has a term that can be renewed in December 2027 and is extendable for any number of successive two-year periods, with a final renewal period of three years ending in 2065. At December 31, 2024, our share of the potential exposure under the Bruce Power guarantee was estimated to be $88 million with no carrying amount. Other jointly-owned entities We and our partners in certain other jointly-owned entities have also guaranteed (jointly, severally, jointly and severally, or exclusively) the financial performance of these entities. Such agreements include guarantees and letters of credit which are primarily related to delivery of natural gas. The guarantees have terms ranging to 2032. Our share of the potential exposure under these assurances was estimated at December 31, 2024 to be approximately $59 million with a carrying amount of $1 million. In certain cases, if we make a payment that exceeds our ownership interest, the additional amount must be reimbursed by our partners. OBLIGATIONS – PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS In 2024, we made no funding contributions to our defined benefit pension plans (DB Plans), $8 million for other post-retirement benefit plans and $71 million for the savings plan and defined contribution plans. Total letters of credit provided for the funding of solvency requirements to the Canadian DB plan at December 31, 2024 was $111 million (2023 – $244 million; 2022 – $322 million). In 2025, we expect to make no contributions for the DB Plans, funding contributions of approximately $6 million for other post-retirement benefit plans and approximately $71 million for the savings plans and defined contribution pension plans. We do not expect to issue additional letters of credit to the Canadian DB Plan for the funding of solvency requirements. The net benefit cost for our DB Plans and other post-retirement plans decreased to $19 million in 2024 from $20 million in 2023 primarily due to a change in Canadian post-retirement benefits. South Bow - transition of pension assets As part of the Spinoff Transaction, certain TC Energy employees became employees of South Bow. Prior to the Spinoff Transaction, these employees in Canada and the U.S. participated in the DB Plans, DC Plans and savings plans, as applicable. As part of the Spinoff Transaction, the benefit obligations under the DB Plans in respect of the employees moving from TC Energy to South Bow were transferred to South Bow. An asset transfer application related to the Canadian DB Plan will be prepared in early 2025 outlining the proposed transfer of assets from TC Energy to South Bow. The Canadian DB Plan's assets to be transferred to South Bow are subject to regulatory approval and will be transferred when approval is received. As of December 31, 2024, these assets remain in the TC Energy DB Plan trust and have been reflected as Long-term assets of discontinued operations and a corresponding obligation to South Bow has been reflected as Long-term liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated balance sheet. The assets related to the U.S. DB Plan were fully transferred to South Bow as at December 31, 2024. 92 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Future net benefit costs and the amount we will need to contribute to fund our plans will depend on a range of factors including: • interest rates • actual returns on plan assets • changes to actuarial assumptions and plan design • actual plan experience versus projections • amendments to pension plan regulations and legislation. We do not expect future increases in the level of funding needed to maintain our plans to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial condition.

Discontinued operations On July 27, 2023, TC Energy announced plans to separate into two independent, investment-grade, publicly listed companies through the Spinoff Transaction. TC Energy shareholders voted to approve the spinoff in June 2024 and, on October 1, 2024, TC Energy completed the spinoff of its Liquids Pipelines business into the new public company, South Bow Corporation. TC Energy shareholders as of September 25, 2024 received one new TC Energy common share and 0.2 of a South Bow common share in exchange for each TC Energy common share held. TC Energy common shares resumed regular way trading on the TSX and NYSE on October 2, 2024. South Bow's common shares commenced regular way trading on the TSX on October 2, 2024 and on the NYSE on October 8, 2024, under the ticker symbol SOBO. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued operations, for additional information. Agreements TC Energy and South Bow have executed a series of agreements to outline the parameters and guidelines that govern their ongoing relationship and to specify the separation of assets and liabilities between the two corporations. A Transition Services Agreement has been established, the primary purpose of which is to specify certain services that TC Energy will provide to South Bow, for compensation, for a period of up to two years. These services primarily include access to and support of systems that South Bow will continue to use until it has fully implemented new systems to support its business processes and warehouse management services. As part of the Spinoff Transaction, a Tax Matters Agreement was executed to govern TC Energy and South Bow's tax rights and obligations after the Spinoff Transaction. The agreement imposes certain restrictions on both TC Energy and South Bow in order to preserve the tax-free status of the spinoff and allocates tax liabilities in the event the Spinoff Transaction is not tax-free. TC Energy and South Bow entered into a Separation Agreement setting forth the terms of the separation of the Liquids Pipelines business from the business of TC Energy, including the transfer of certain assets related to the Liquids Pipelines business from TC Energy to South Bow and the allocation of certain liabilities and obligations related to the Liquids Pipelines business between TC Energy and South Bow. The Separation Agreement provides, among other things, that TC Energy will indemnify South Bow for 86 per cent of total net liabilities and costs arising from the Milepost 14 incident that occurred on the Keystone Pipeline System in December 2022 and the existing variable toll disputes on the Keystone Pipeline System (excluding any future impacts to the variable toll after October 1, 2024) subject to a maximum liability to South Bow of $30 million, in aggregate, for those two matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the final amounts to be settled under these indemnities, any amounts that may ultimately be payable in respect of these net liabilities to South Bow could differ materially from those reported at December 31, 2024. Milepost 14 Incident In December 2022, a pipeline incident occurred in Washington County, Kansas on the Keystone Pipeline System, releasing 12,937 barrels of crude oil. In June 2023, we completed the recovery of all released volumes and in October 2023, we returned Mill Creek to its natural flowing state. South Bow will maintain the commitment for long-term reclamation and environmental monitoring activities. At December 31, 2023, we accrued a life-to-date environmental liability for the Milepost 14 incident of $794 million, before expected insurance recoveries and not including potential fines and penalties, which were indeterminable. Prior to the Spinoff Transaction, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounts paid for the environmental remediation liability were $92 million (twelve months ended December 31, 2023 – $676 million). For the year ended December 31, 2024, we received $99 million (2023 – $575 million) from insurance policies related to the costs for environmental remediation. We received insurance proceeds of $36 million related to the Milepost 14 incident that were collected from our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and resulted in an impact to net income in the consolidated financial results of TC Energy. This amount has been excluded from comparable measures from discontinued operations. As part of the Separation Agreement, all future insurance recoveries will remain with TC Energy. In fourth quarter 2024, we recorded a pre-tax expense of $37 million for our current estimate of potential incremental costs related to the Milepost 14 incident, which has been excluded from comparable measures from discontinued operations. This amount represents our 86 per cent share pursuant to the indemnity provisions in the Separation Agreement. 94 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

CER and FERC Proceedings In 2019 and 2020, three Keystone customers initiated complaints before FERC and the CER regarding certain costs within the variable toll calculation. In December 2022, the CER issued a decision in respect of the complaint that resulted in an adjustment to previously charged tolls of $38 million, of which $27 million pertained to amounts reflected in 2021 and 2020 and was excluded from comparable measures from discontinued operations. The CER has established a proceeding to consider Keystone’s compliance filing required by the decision regarding the allocation of costs for drag reducing agent in the variable toll. On July 25, 2024, FERC released its Order on Initial Decision in respect of the complaint. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an additional pre-tax charge of $12 million (2023 – $67 million including carrying charges) with respect to the decision, which has been excluded from comparable measures from discontinued operations. On October 8, 2024, South Bow submitted a compliance filing, which is subject to final FERC approval. Subsequent rulings from both the CER and FERC, if any, will be subject to the indemnity provisions as outlined in the Separation Agreement. Separation Costs Liquids Pipelines business separation costs primarily include internal costs related to separation activities, legal, income tax, audit and other consulting fees, insurance provisions and net financial charges related to debt issued and held in escrow. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Liquids Pipelines business separation costs of $197 million ($167 million after tax) and $40 million ($34 million after tax), respectively, were included in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated statement of income and have been excluded from our calculation of comparable measures from discontinued operations. South Bow Debt On August 28, 2024, South Bow Canadian Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. and 6297782 LLC, which were wholly-owned subsidiaries of TC Energy at the time, completed an offering of approximately $7.9 billion Canadian-dollar equivalent of senior unsecured notes and junior subordinated notes. Approximately $6.2 billion Canadian-dollar equivalent of the net proceeds was placed in escrow pending the completion of the Spinoff Transaction on October 1, 2024 and US$1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes were used to repay a TCPL term loan. Upon completion of the Spinoff Transaction, the escrowed funds were released to South Bow and used to repay indebtedness owed by South Bow and its subsidiaries to TC Energy and its subsidiaries. Liquids Pipelines business separation costs also included interest expense of $42 million and interest income of $28 million related to senior unsecured notes and junior subordinated notes issued on August 28, 2024 and held in escrow, which have been excluded from our calculation of comparable measures from discontinued operations. Presentation of Discontinued Operations Upon completion of the Spinoff Transaction, the Liquids Pipelines business was accounted for as a discontinued operation. Our presentation of discontinued operations includes revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Liquids Pipelines business. As such, the results of discontinued operations excludes shared costs related to TC Energy’s corporate services and governance functions that had provided support, and whose costs had been historically allocated, to the Liquids Pipelines segment. Depreciation expense related to Corporate shared assets has also been excluded from the results of discontinued operations. We have elected to allocate a portion of the interest expense incurred at the corporate level to discontinued operations. In 2024, discontinued operations represented nine months of Liquids Pipelines earnings compared to a full year of Liquids Pipelines earnings in 2023 and 2022.

Other information RISK OVERSIGHT AND ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is embedded in all activities at TC Energy and is integral to the successful operation of our business. Our strategy ensures that risks and related exposures are aligned with our business objectives and risk tolerances. We achieve this through a centralized Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which systematically identifies and assesses risks that could materially impact our strategic objectives. The ERM program addresses risks related to executing our business strategies and supports practices for identifying and monitoring emerging risks. Specifically, the ERM framework offers a comprehensive process for risk identification, analysis, evaluation and mitigation. It also ensures ongoing monitoring and reporting to the Board of Directors, CEO, Executive Vice-Presidents and the Chief Risk Officer. Board and Committee Oversight Our Board of Directors retains general oversight over all enterprise risks. Annually, the Board reviews the enterprise risk register and receives quarterly updates on emerging risks and their management and mitigation in accordance with TC Energy’s risk appetite and tolerances. Additionally, the Board receives detailed presentations on enterprise risks quarterly, with specific themes addressed during regular financial updates and strategic meetings. Special presentations are also delivered as needed or upon request. The Governance Committee of our Board oversees the ERM program, ensuring comprehensive oversight of our risk management activities. In addition, other Board committees oversee specific risk types within their mandates: • the Human Resources Committee oversees executive resourcing, organizational capabilities and compensation risk to ensure human and labour policies and remuneration practices align with our overall business strategy • the HSSE Committee oversees operational, major project execution, health, safety, sustainability and environmental risks, including climate-related risks • the Audit Committee oversees management's role in mitigating financial risk, including market risk, counterparty credit risk and cybersecurity risk. Executive Leadership and Risk Management Our Executive Leadership team is responsible for developing and implementing risk management plans and actions, with effective risk management reflected in their compensation. Each identified enterprise risk has a governance owner from the executive leadership team. Risk execution is overseen by an accountable Business Unit President or Senior Vice-President. These risk owners provide in-depth risk reviews to the Board annually. Segment-Specific Risks Key segment-specific financial, health, safety, and environment-related risks are covered in their respective sections of this MD&A. Further, our Report on Sustainability provides information on our approach to sustainability, including the oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Enterprise Risk Monitoring and Key Risk Indicators Risks related to our key enterprise risk themes are continuously monitored through our ERM program. The program includes a network of emerging risk liaisons strategically positioned across the organization, responsible for identifying potential enterprise-level risks and reporting them quarterly to the Board of Directors. Additionally, as part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing the ERM program, we have identified and are adopting Key Risk and Performance Indicators (KRIs) for risk events that could impact our strategic objectives. These KRIs provide quantifiable metrics, objective rationale and meaningful trends for each enterprise risk, helping to inform the annual in-depth review of enterprise risks conducted by the Board. 102 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Operational risk TC Energy operates a vast natural gas transmission network across North America, including numerous facilities, gas storage reservoirs and power-generation plants. Operational risks include the potential for significant ruptures or failures, especially in regions where pipelines traverse populated areas. Key factors contributing to these risks include integrity threats such as corrosion, cracking and manufacturing defects. Additionally, aging infrastructure and the potential for extreme weather conditions and other external forces further increase the likelihood of significant ruptures or operational failures. The consequences of a significant rupture or operational failure can be severe and multifaceted. Potential impacts include loss of human life or severe injuries, environmental damage and extensive operational disruptions. Financial repercussions are also considerable, encompassing costs related to incident response, repairs, fines and penalties. Furthermore, such incidents can lead to incremental regulatory enforcement and reputational harm, which may strain customer relationships and jeopardize future projects. To ensure the safe and reliable operation of its assets, TC Energy employs a robust Operational Management System, TOMS, that integrates comprehensive risk management and asset integrity practices. Current measures include a quantitative operational risk assessment process, integrity management programs and advanced inline inspection technologies. We also conduct failure investigations and root cause analyses to drive continuous improvement. Governance and oversight by senior management, along with an Emergency Management Program, ensure preparedness and effective response to potential incidents. TOMS standards, processes and procedures are continually improved based on lessons learned from internal and external incidents, as well as collaborative work with industry peers and regulators. Regulatory risk TC Energy operates in a highly regulated industry across North America, requiring various permits and approvals from federal, state, provincial and local government agencies. The regulatory landscape is highly complex, with overlapping and sometimes conflicting requirements from various levels of government. Changes in government can further introduce uncertainty and delays in obtaining necessary permits. Additionally, opposition groups can influence regulatory decisions through organized protests, legal challenges and negative media campaigns. Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for energy infrastructure projects can lead to substantial financial and operational consequences. These include delays or cancellations of critical projects, increased operating costs due to additional compliance requirements and disruptions to existing infrastructure. Financial impacts also encompass lost development costs, reduced investor confidence and higher capital costs. Moreover, negative publicity and public opposition can damage our reputation, erode public trust and hinder our ability to operate effectively. These challenges can ultimately affect our competitive position and ability to meet growth objectives. To address this risk, we have implemented several monitoring and mitigation strategies. These include proactive efforts to monitor the evolving regulatory environment, engage in strategic advocacy across all levels of government, cultivate enduring trust and alignment with stakeholders and respond promptly to emerging issues and concerns. These activities are designed to secure necessary approvals to support our growth objectives and mitigate potential delays and disruptions. Access to capital at a competitive cost We require significant capital in the form of debt and equity to finance our growth projects and manage maturing debt obligations. It is essential that we secure this capital at costs lower than the returns on our investments. Deterioration in market conditions, changes in investor and lender sentiment, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and persistent inflation could adversely affect our access to and cost of capital. Additionally, factors such as investor ESG exclusionary screening, capacity limitations in capital markets and economic uncertainties can further compound these risks, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs and constrained growth. A higher cost of capital can negatively impact our ability to deliver attractive returns on investments and inhibit both short and long-term growth. This could adversely affect our earnings and undermine the viability of capital projects. Additionally, higher costs can negatively impact investor confidence, the reported value of assets and liabilities and our overall financial performance.

TC Energy employs a comprehensive strategy to monitor and mitigate these risks. Current mitigations include maintaining a high-quality and diversified banking syndicate, proactive engagement with lenders and credit rating agencies and balancing issuance strategies across multiple capital markets. We also actively manage our foreign exchange risk through hedging strategies and maintain a balanced debt portfolio to manage interest rate exposure. Ongoing mitigations involve developing new lending relationships and enhancing engagement with ESG-focused investors. Additionally, TC Energy continuously monitors government policies and industry developments to proactively address potential influences on capital flows. Capital allocation To remain competitive, TC Energy must provide essential energy infrastructure services in both supply and demand areas, offering solutions that appeal to our customers, while maintaining alignment with our strategic objectives. Capital allocation challenges include balancing investments to defend our existing footprint and service our customer base, investing in the highest-return, lowest-risk opportunities within our discretionary annual net capital limit and shaping the capital program to optimally utilize available capital. Additionally, there is a risk of diversifying into lower-carbon opportunities before they have adequately developed commercial and regulatory constructs. Inefficient capital allocation can lead to the misallocation of financial resources to projects that do not align with our strategic objectives, increase exposure to high-risk projects and reduce financial performance. Additionally, failure to adapt to changing energy supply and demand fundamentals, including those related to lower-carbon forms of energy, may result in reputational damage, regulatory risks and the potential for stranded assets. Overall, these risks can cause strategic misalignment and diminish shareholder value. We have a rigorous governance process to maintain capital allocation discipline. We limit annual net capital expenditures and high-grade our project development pipeline for purposes of pursuing lower risk and higher value opportunities. We also conduct analyses to confirm the resilience of the supply and demand markets we serve as part of our strategic reviews and regularly monitor industry trends and regulatory developments. Continuous improvements to the capital allocation process include enhanced investment review and due diligence, as well as conducting long-term scenario analyses to understand the portfolio effects of capital allocation choices. Capital recovery risk Capital recovery risk pertains to the challenge of both earning an acceptable return on invested capital and recovering the initial investment. This risk arises from potential misalignment between deal structures and our risk preferences, leading to capital exposure. Key contributors include inadequate risk assessments, difficulties in stakeholder collaboration, unforeseen changes in project scope or environment, financial constraints, macroeconomic volatility, counterparty risk and evolving public policy. Collectively, these factors threaten our financial stability and strategic objectives. The inability to recover a return on capital can lead to unexpected capital expenditures, significant financial losses and reduced returns. It can erode trust and credibility with partners, investors, regulators and other key stakeholders. Additionally, poorly structured deals may divert management’s focus from core business activities to address arising issues, further impacting operational efficiency. The broader consequences include potential damage to our reputation and investor confidence, which are crucial for sustaining long-term growth and stability and preserving shareholder value. TC Energy employs a robust due diligence process that includes comprehensive risk assessments and detailed contract negotiations. Continuous monitoring of risk exposures and mitigation measures is conducted throughout the lifecycle of each deal, high-grading our project development pipeline to the lowest-risk, highest value opportunities. Proactive engagement with counterparties and strategic partnerships helps manage and share risks effectively. Depreciation is recovered through regulated pipeline rates, allowing us to accelerate or decelerate the return of capital from our assets. Additionally, we leverage our diversified asset base and long-term contracts to stabilize cash flows and reduce exposure to market volatility. 104 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Page 107
Project execution Investing in large infrastructure projects requires significant capital commitments and carries considerable project execution risks. Potential shortages of skilled labour and expertise, supply chain lead times and disruptions and increasing project and regulatory complexity are among these risks. Collectively, these factors can lead to cost overruns, schedule delays, suboptimal project performance and increased safety vulnerabilities, ultimately impacting our financial performance, reputation and strategic growth. Failure to effectively manage these risks can result in significant financial and operational consequences. Cost overruns and schedule delays can undermine the profitability and feasibility of projects, leading to increased contractual claims and disputes. Additionally, inadequate project execution can damage our reputation, reduce investor confidence and hinder future growth opportunities. To help mitigate these risks, our Project Delivery System is integrated with our capital allocation process and is aligned with TOMS, optimizing project execution for safe, timely and on-budget performance. We develop projects to a sufficient maturity level to fully understand scope, cost, schedule and execution risk prior to sanctioning. This approach enables us to identify and consult stakeholders and proactively address project-specific constraints and risks. Commercial contracts are structured to recover development costs and minimize the impact of potential cost overruns, explicitly sharing execution risk where warranted. Additionally, we leverage project financing and partner involvement to manage capital at risk. Talent risk TC Energy's success hinges on attracting, retaining and developing a talented workforce with a deep understanding of the energy industry, geopolitical environment and various regulatory regimes across North America. Key talent-related risks include the loss of critical personnel, difficulties in securing and retaining talent in a highly competitive market and health and wellness issues that could impact workforce productivity. Failure to manage talent-related risk can lead to several adverse outcomes, including a decline in employee morale and engagement, resulting in reduced productivity, efficiency and quality of work. High resignation rates, particularly among top talent, can disrupt operations and continuity, leading to increased recruitment and training costs. The organization may also face reputational damage if perceived as failing to address employee concerns, impacting its ability to attract and retain future talent. Furthermore, operational disruptions and a disengaged workforce can pose health and safety risks, ultimately affecting our overall performance and strategic execution. To mitigate these risks, TC Energy employs a comprehensive talent risk management framework to assess needs and prioritize initiatives. We focus on employee development, engagement and well-being to foster a positive work environment and retain top talent. Our company-wide Pay Equity Plan promotes fairness in compensation practices, while our succession planning process ensures a steady pipeline of talented individuals are prepared to assume critical roles. Regular employee engagement surveys provide valuable insights and inform targeted recommendations. Additionally, we have integrated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives into our talent management strategies and implemented a hybrid work schedule to offer greater flexibility. Collectively, this approach promotes employee retention, minimizes the impact of potential talent losses and guides targeted development actions. Enterprise security Ensuring the security of our stakeholders, staff, and our digital and physical assets is paramount to maintaining the safety and reliability of our operations. Security risks encompass potential cyberattacks on industrial control systems and corporate digital assets, unauthorized data disclosures and physical attacks on our infrastructure. These risks are heightened by the increasing sophistication of cyber tactics, rising geopolitical tensions and the critical nature of our infrastructure. A security incident can result in the misuse or disruption of critical information and functions, cause damage to our assets and potentially lead to safety and/or environmental incidents and inability to provide services. Resulting service interruptions may have cascading effects on supply chains, customer relationships and strategic goals. Additionally, such incidents can harm our reputation and trigger regulatory enforcement actions or litigation, negatively impacting our operations and/or financial position.

TC Energy maintains an enterprise security program covering cyber and physical security. Our program is based on standards, assurance, risk management and prevention and mitigation activities. Our cyber and physical security risk preventative efforts include deploying security technology, defining secure processes, enhanced security measures for high-risk staff or facilities, and cyber and physical security awareness programs. Our mitigative activities include proactive monitoring for and responding to potential security incidents. We also maintain and regularly test incident response plans to manage and mitigate the impact of potential security incidents including cyberattacks. To further mitigate potential risks, we maintain appropriate insurance coverage against cyber and physical security incidents. To mitigate risks associated with third-party vendors and suppliers, we conduct vendor risk assessments which includes risk assessments focused on security standards, contractual safeguards, and ongoing monitoring. We collaborate with government security agencies, law enforcement, and industry to stay informed and be proactive on evolving threats. Our prevention and mitigation strategies for both cyber and physical security are regularly reviewed and updated to align with regulatory and industry standards. The status of our enterprise security program is reported to the Audit Committee quarterly. TC Energy remains committed to continually improving our security posture and adapting to the ever-evolving threat landscape. By prioritizing security and investing in technologies and practices, we strive to protect our stakeholders, staff, assets, operations, and ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. Climate-related risks Our business, operations, financial condition and performance may be impacted by both the physical risks associated with climate change and the transition risks arising from the global transition to a lower-carbon economy. Climate-related risks, including climate policy and related developments, may intersect with and influence the enterprise risks outlined above. Therefore, these risks are systematically considered and assessed as part of the Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Physical Risks Climate change has the potential to create both acute and chronic physical risks that can negatively impact our operations. Acute physical risks could include extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires and floods, whereas chronic physical risks could include longer-term shifts in climate patterns, temperature, precipitation and sea levels. Due to the complex nature of climate systems, it is difficult to predict the timing, frequency or severity of such events. The physical risks from climate change could have significant financial implications, such as unexpected costs resulting from direct damage to our assets, loss of revenues due to business interruption or indirect effects such as value chain disruption. To mitigate these physical risks, we take climate change into account in the design and evaluation of our facilities and operating assets. Our engineering standards are regularly reviewed to ensure assets continue to be designed and operated to withstand the potential impacts of climate change. Additionally, our emergency response plans focus on quickly and effectively responding to severe weather events to minimize impacts. As a further risk mitigation measure, we maintain insurance coverage to reduce the financial impact associated with damage to our assets due to extreme weather events. We may experience an increase in insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. Transition Risks Transition risks arise from the global shift to a lower-carbon economy. Transition risks include policy, legal, technological, market and reputational risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in energy supply and demand trajectories, the pace and reliability of technological advancements, changes in decarbonization policies and regulations and stakeholder perceptions of our role in the transition to a lower-carbon economy. Financial implications from transition risks could include asset impairments due to new or amended climate-related regulations, reduced demand for fossil fuels, challenges in permitting projects and limited access to and/or increased cost of capital. Our financial performance could also be impacted by shifting consumer demands, insolvency of our significant customers and the development and deployment of new technologies. Our exposure to climate-related transition risks and resulting policy changes is mitigated through our long-term, low-risk business strategy whereby much of our earnings are underpinned by regulated cost-of-service arrangements and/or long-term contracts with credit-worthy counterparties. Additional information on how we manage climate-related risks and opportunities can be found in the comprehensive TCFD and IFRS S2 alignment sections of our annual Report on Sustainability. 106 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

We use an integrated management system that establishes a framework for managing these risks and is used to capture, organize, document, monitor and improve our related policies, standards and procedures. TC Energy's Operational Management System, TOMS, leverages industry best practices and standards and incorporates applicable regulatory requirements. TOMS governs health, safety, environment and operational integrity matters at TC Energy. It is applicable across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico throughout the lifecycle of our assets and employs a continuous improvement cycle. The TOMS framework leverages continuous improvement through an annual management review process. This ensures the ongoing effectiveness of our overarching management system and supports a tiered assurance structure across all business units. The TC Energy assurance model is designed to provide effective management of health, safety, environmental, and operational integrity risks. Lessons learned are consistently shared and applied across our system where applicable. Additionally, any findings or insights from periodic audits conducted by our external regulators are also shared across the elements of our management system to ensure continuous improvement. The HSSE Committee reviews performance and operational risk management. It receives updates and reports on: • overall HSSE corporate governance • operational performance • asset integrity • significant occupational safety and process safety incidents • occupational and process safety performance metrics • occupational health, safety and industrial hygiene, which includes physical and mental health, as well as psychological safety • emergency preparedness, incident response and evaluation • environment, including biodiversity and land reclamation • developments in and compliance with applicable legislation and regulations, including those related to the environment • prevention, mitigation and management of risks related to HSSE matters, including climate change or business interruption risks, such as pandemics, which may adversely impact TC Energy • sustainability matters, including social, environmental and climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as related non-regulatory public disclosures such as our annual Report on Sustainability and our Reconciliation Action Plan. There are two separate committees that report to the Board HSSE Committee: • a Sustainability Management Committee, comprised of senior leaders, that provides strategic leadership and direction on environmental, social and governance issues to integrate sustainability principles across the company’s operations and projects • an Operating Committee that is comprised of senior leaders, that is responsible for making enterprise decisions in support of safety improvements, management system governance and operational risk management.

Health, safety and asset integrity The safety of our employees, contractors and the public, the integrity of our pipelines and our power and energy solutions infrastructure, are a top priority. All assets are designed, constructed, commissioned, operated and maintained with full consideration given to safety and integrity and are placed in service only after all necessary requirements, both regulatory and internal, have been satisfied. In 2024, we spent $2.0 billion (2023 1 – $2.0 billion) for pipeline integrity on the natural gas pipelines we operate, which includes expenditures related to our modernization program within our U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines business. Pipeline integrity spending will fluctuate based on the results of on-going risk assessments conducted on our pipeline systems and evaluations of information obtained from recent inspections, incidents and maintenance activities. Under the approved regulatory models in Canada, non-capital pipeline integrity expenditures on CER-regulated natural gas pipelines are generally treated on a flow-through basis and, as a result, fluctuations in these expenditures generally have no impact on our earnings. Non-capital pipeline integrity expenditures on our U.S. natural gas pipelines are primarily treated as operations and maintenance expenditures and are typically recoverable through tolls approved by FERC. Spending associated with process safety and integrity is used to minimize risk to employees, contractors, the public, equipment and the surrounding environment and also prevent disruptions to serving the energy needs of our customers. As described in the Risk oversight and enterprise risk management section above, we have a set of procedures in place to manage our response to natural disasters, which include catastrophic events such as forest fires, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes. The procedures, which are included in our Emergency, Business Continuity and Security element of TOMS, are designed to help protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors, minimize risk to the public and limit the potential for adverse effects on the environment. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of all individuals involved in our activities. Occupational health, safety and industrial hygiene provides comprehensive strategies for health promotion and protection. We are committed to delivering effective programs that: • reduce the human and financial impact of illness and injury • ensure fitness for work • strengthen worker resiliency • build organizational capacity by focusing on individual wellbeing, health education, leader support and improved working conditions to sustain a productive workforce • increase mental wellbeing awareness, provide various health and wellness supports and training to employees and leaders, measure the success of programs and improve psychological safety • foster a positive safety culture by building human and organizational performance to strengthen our cultural defenses and develop error-tolerant systems to better protect our people. Environmental risk, compliance and liabilities Through the implementation of TOMS, TC Energy proactively and systematically manages environmental hazards and risks throughout the lifecycle of our assets. We complete environmental assessments for our projects, which include field studies that examine existing natural resources, biodiversity and land use along our proposed project footprint, such as vegetation, soils, wildlife, water resources, wetland and protected areas. We consider the information collected during environmental assessments and where sensitive habitats or areas of high biodiversity value are identified, we apply the biodiversity protection hierarchy and avoid those areas, as practicable. Where those areas cannot be avoided, we minimize our disturbance, restore and reclaim the disturbed area and provide offsets where required. To conserve and protect the environment during construction, information gathered for an environmental impact assessment is used to develop project-specific environmental protection plans. Whenever the potential exists for a proposed facility or pipeline to interact with water resources, we conduct evaluations to understand the full nature and extent of the interactions. When we temporarily use water to test the integrity of our pipelines, we adhere to strict regulatory requirements and ensure water meets applicable water quality standards before it is discharged or disposed of and when our construction activities involve crossing waterbodies, we implement protection measures to avoid or minimize potential adverse effects. Project plans are communicated with stakeholders and Indigenous communities, as applicable and engagement with these groups informs the environmental assessments and protection plans. 108 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 1 Prior year results have been recast to reflect continuing operations only.

Our primary sources of risk related to the environment include: • changing regulations and requirements coupled with increased costs related to impacts on the environment • product releases which may cause harm to the environment (land, water and air) • use, storage and disposal of chemicals and hazardous materials • natural disasters and other catastrophic events, including those related to climate change, which may impact our operations. Our assets are subject to federal, state, provincial and local environmental statutes and regulations governing environmental protection, including air and GHG emissions, water quality, species at risk, wastewater discharges and waste management. Operating our assets requires obtaining and complying with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals and requirements. Failure to comply could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial requirements, or orders affecting future operations. TOMS includes requirements for TC Energy to continually monitor our facilities for compliance with all material legal and regulatory environmental requirements across all jurisdictions where we operate. We also comply with all material legal and regulatory permitting requirements in our project routing and development. We routinely monitor proposed changes to environmental policy, legislation and regulation. Where the risks are uncertain or have the potential to affect our ability to effectively operate our business, we comment on proposals independently or through industry associations. We are not aware of any material outstanding orders, claims or lawsuits against us related to releasing or discharging any material into the environment. Compliance obligations can result in significant costs associated with installing and maintaining pollution controls, fines and penalties resulting from any failure to comply and potential limitations on operations. Remediation obligations can result in significant costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties and with damage claims arising from the contamination of properties. The timing and complete extent of future expenditures related to environmental matters is difficult to estimate accurately because: • environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations and enforcement change • new claims can be brought against our existing or discontinued assets • our pollution control and clean-up cost estimates may change, especially when our current estimates are based on preliminary site investigations or agreements • new contaminated sites may be found or what we know about existing sites could change • where there is potentially more than one responsible party involved in litigation, we cannot estimate our joint and several liability with certainty. At December 31, 2024, accruals related to these obligations totaled $8 million (2023 – $19 million) representing the estimated amount we will need to manage our currently known material environmental liabilities. We believe we have considered all necessary contingencies and established appropriate reserves for environmental liabilities; however, a risk exists that unforeseen matters may arise requiring us to set aside additional amounts. We adjust reserves regularly to account for changes in liabilities. Climate change and related regulation We own assets and have business interests in a number of regions subject to GHG emissions regulations, including GHG emissions management and carbon pricing policies. In 2024, we incurred $141 million (2023 – $109 million) of expenses under existing carbon pricing programs. Across North America, there are a variety of new and evolving initiatives and policies in development at the federal, regional, state and provincial levels aimed at reducing GHG emissions. We actively monitor, participate in the regulatory review process as appropriate and submit formal comments to regulators as initiatives are undertaken and as policies are implemented. We support transparent climate change policies that promote environmentally and economically responsible natural resource development. Our assets in specific geographies are currently subject to GHG regulations. While near-term government policy objectives may influence the pace of GHG regulations, we expect that the number of our assets subject to GHG regulations will continue to increase over time and across our footprint. Changes in regulations may result in higher operating costs, other expenses or capital expenditures to comply with new or more stringent regulations. The following existing jurisdictional policies and anticipated policies sections describe some of the more relevant existing and anticipated policies applicable to our business. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 109

Page 112
Existing jurisdictional policies Canadian jurisdictions • Federal: The Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) took effect in January 2020 to reduce the oil and gas sector's methane emissions by 40 to 45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan have released their own methane regulations that replace the federal regulations for provincially-regulated assets. For federally-regulated facilities in these jurisdictions, the federal methane regulations are applicable. Compliance with the regulations requires leak detection and repair (LDAR) surveys and a reduction of vented emissions from specific equipment. Power facilities are not affected by this regulation at the current time • Federal: The Federal OBPS regulation imposes carbon pricing for larger industrial facilities and sets federal benchmarks for GHG emissions for various industry sectors. This regulation applies to our assets in Manitoba. As a result of the Federal program, our assets across Canada are all subject to some type of carbon pricing and the costs under these programs are recovered through tolls. In 2024, the carbon price was $80/tonne, currently scheduled to increase by $15/tonne every year to $170/tonne in 2030 • Federal: On December 19, 2024, ECCC published the final Clean Electricity Regulations (CERs), targeting a net-zero electricity system by 2050. The CERs mandate an annual GHG emissions limit based on 65 tonnes CO 2 /GWh for fossil fuel power generation units with a capacity of 25 MW or more starting in 2035 and 0 tonnes CO 2 /GWh in 2050. Though there are limited compliance flexibilities, concerns persist on the CERs’ potential effect on energy affordability and reliability in certain jurisdictions. We continue to evaluate the operational and financial impact on our cogeneration fleet • British Columbia: As of April 2024, British Columbia implemented a provincial OBPS in place of the carbon tax, for taxing GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion at industrial facilities. The B.C. OBPS applies to our assets in British Columbia and compliance costs are recovered through tolls. With the implementation of the B.C. OBPS, the CleanBC Industrial Incentive Program, which offered carbon tax rebates to low emitting industrial facilities, will be phased out as of 2025 • Alberta: In Alberta, the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation has been in effect since January 2020. The TIER regulation requires established industrial facilities with GHG emissions above a certain threshold to reduce their emissions below an intensity baseline. The TIER system covers all of our natural gas pipelines and Power and Energy Solutions assets in Alberta. Compliance costs with respect to our regulated Canadian natural gas pipelines are recovered through tolls. A portion of the compliance costs for the Power and Energy Solutions assets are recovered through market pricing and hedging activities • Québec: Québec has a GHG cap-and-trade program under the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) GHG emissions market. In Québec, our Bécancour cogeneration plant is subject to this program as are the Canadian Mainline and TQM natural gas pipeline facilities. The provincial government allocates free emission units for a portion of Bécancour's compliance requirements. The remaining requirements are met with GHG instruments purchased at auctions or secondary markets. The costs of these emissions units are recovered through commercial contracts. For TQM and the Canadian Mainline assets in Québec, compliance instruments have been or will be purchased to comply with the WCI requirements with these compliance costs being recovered through tolls • Ontario: The Federal OBPS in Ontario was replaced on January 1, 2022 by the Ontario Emissions Performance Standards (OEPS) program. The OEPS program applies to our Canadian Mainline operations in the province and costs under this program are recovered in tolls • Saskatchewan: The Federal OBPS in Saskatchewan was replaced on January 1, 2023 by the Saskatchewan Output-Based Performance Standard program for pipeline transmission sector assets. The regulation applies to our Canadian Mainline and Foothills operations in the province and costs under this program are recovered in tolls. 110 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

U.S. jurisdictions • Federal: On December 2, 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) released a final rule that amends and supplements the New Source Performance Standards – Subpart OOOO series of volatile organic compound and methane emissions regulations for the oil and natural gas industry. The rule, collectively referred to as the “Methane Rule,” sets performance standards for new, modified, or reconstructed sources after December 2022 (OOOOb) and establishes emission guidelines (EGs) for existing sources prior to December 2022 (OOOOc). Under OOOOc, the states will submit their plans to meet the EGs for existing sources to the USEPA within 24 months after publication of the final rule and existing compressor stations would be required to comply with a state’s new EGs no later than 36 months after the state plan is submitted to USEPA. The Methane Rule includes fugitive component LDAR requirements, a zero-emission process (pneumatic) controller standard, emission limitations for reciprocating and centrifugal compressors and a third-party reporting program facilitated by USEPA for identifying large gas release events (Super Emitter program). The OOOOb standards will apply to a relatively limited number of facilities and the costs of compliance are anticipated to be incorporated into new and modified facilities moving forward. The OOOOc standards would apply to a larger number of existing facilities, but impacts will be subject to the requirements of yet to be issued state EG proposals and actual compliance deadlines, which will vary based on state and/or location • Federal: The USEPA “Good Neighbor Plan”, effective August 2023, sets new limits for emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) by May 2026. The rule could cost TC Energy over US$500 million in mitigation measures, but Federal Circuit courts have granted stays in 12 states, including eight states in which TC Energy has affected RICE, reducing our compliance obligations pending the outcomes of these proceedings. Additionally, TC Energy, among other peer companies and industry groups, is party to ongoing legal proceedings in the D.C. Circuit and on June 27, 2024, the Supreme Court granted a nationwide emergency stay of the Rule that will last for the duration of the pending litigation in the D.C. Circuit and until the Supreme Court resolves petitions for certiorari (if any are filed). The D.C. Circuit is expected to issue a final decision in the second half of 2025. If the rule is ultimately upheld, the USEPA is expected, but not required, to provide industry with additional time beyond its May 1, 2026 compliance deadline to come into compliance • Federal : USEPA finalized changes to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) for how oil and gas sources tally and report their methane emissions (Subpart W) on May 6, 2024. The Final Rule finalizes previously proposed GHGRP amendments and also addresses USEPA’s mandate, as defined in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to amend Subpart W for the purposes of improving methane emission estimates associated with the IRA waste emissions charge for natural gas operations. USEPA did not finalize changes in the GHGRP for how oil and gas sources tally and report their energy consumption (Subpart B) via a final rule at this time. The Final Rule effects various changes that would add new reporting sources, modify calculation and reporting methodologies and drive more granular data collection. The Final Rule is still being assessed, but the methodological changes could result in material changes to TC Energy’s publicly reported emissions • Federal: The IRA was passed and signed into law in August 2022. The IRA instructed USEPA to implement a waste methane fee program by 2024 based on GHG emissions reported to USEPA as required by 40 CFR 98 Subpart W. In response, on November 8, 2024, USEPA finalized a rule to implement the methane Waste Emissions Charge (“WEC”) program. TC Energy reports to Subpart W for the natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage and onshore natural gas transmission pipeline industry segments. For these industry segments, the WEC imposes and collects a fee on methane emissions that exceeds 0.11 per cent of the natural gas sent for sale from the facility. The proposed fee is US$900/tonne for 2024, US$1,200/tonne for 2025 and US$1,500/tonne for 2026 reporting and forward. In an initial assessment, there would be no fee impact to TC Energy based on 2023 emissions. Over the longer term, potential WEC liability is expected to be low as U.S. natural gas facilities are anticipated to become eligible for a regulatory exemption afforded by compliance with the Methane Rule • California: On September 27, 2024, California signed into law bill SB-219, which amends portions of Sections 38532 and 38533 of the California Health and Safety Code that were established in previous bills SB-253 and SB-261. SB-253 and SB-261 require public and private U.S. companies that perform certain business activities in California to disclose their GHG emissions and climate-related financial risks, respectively. Entities within the scope of SB-261 must prepare and make available on their public websites a climate-related financial risk report by January 1, 2026. Applicability to TC Energy is under evaluation TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 111

• California: California Air Resource Board has revised Subarticle 13 of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Facilities. The regulation applies to three Tuscarora facilities. The revised regulation required a new LDAR monitoring plan by July 1, 2024. The regulation also now requires monitoring and repair of components less than or equal to 0.5 inch and added new requirements for remotely detected plumes • California: California also has a GHG cap-and-trade program linked with Québec's program through the WCI. All Tuscarora facilities fall below the threshold requiring participation in the GHG cap-and-trade program. However, power trading activities in the state do trigger compliance thresholds. These requirements are met with GHG instruments purchased at auctions or secondary markets • Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has an LDAR program for new source installations which require leak repair within 15 days of discovery • Ohio: Effective March 2022, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) finalized Reasonable Available Control Technologies (RACT) requirements and limitations for emissions of NOx from stationary sources in the Cleveland non-attainment area. Columbia Gas Transmission has four facilities in the Cleveland non-attainment area, with two facilities impacted by the rule. A RACT Study was submitted for one of the stations subject to the rule, outlining the steps and cost necessary to install controls by March 2025 to comply with the rule. The other facility subject to the rule is required to perform annual tune-ups to achieve compliance • Maryland: Effective November 2020, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) finalized a methane regulation program for new and existing natural gas facilities that includes an LDAR program, emission control and reporting requirements, plus a requirement to notify not only the MDE, but also the public of any events above a specific threshold. We have one electric-powered compressor station and associated pipeline segments impacted by this regulation • Washington : In late 2022, the Washington Department of Ecology adopted the Cap-and-Invest Program (CIP), which became effective in January 2023 and established a comprehensive, market-based program to reduce carbon pollution and achieve the GHG emissions reduction goals established by the State legislature. The CIP sets a declining limit, or cap, on overall carbon emissions in the state and requires businesses to obtain allowances equal to their covered GHG emissions. Under the CIP, companies are incented to reduce emissions to avoid higher compliance costs, as the cost to obtain allowances will increase as the supply of allowances decreases over time. GTN has three impacted compressor station facilities and cost exposure under the CIP is mainly driven by throughput and fuel forecast data, as well as price volatility in the newly established CIP allowance market. As an active participant in the CIP allowance market, GTN met its first base compliance obligation for 2023 and projected obligation for 2024. Electricity imports are also covered under the CIP, however these remained below compliance thresholds in 2024 • New York: On February 2, 2022, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NY DEC) adopted 6 NYCRR Part 203, “Oil and Natural Gas Sector” with an effective date of March 3, 2022 and an initial compliance period commencing January 1, 2023. Part 203 regulates VOCs and methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Compliance obligations include leak detection and repair at operated storage wells, compressor stations and city gate meter and regulator sites; blowdown notifications, reporting of pigging activities, as well as a baseline inventory for all assets in New York • Michigan: In April 2023, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) published its final RACT requirements and emission limitations for major stationary sources of VOCs in specific counties of the state (2015 ozone non-attainment area). Specifically, storage vessels at two ANR compressor stations are impacted by this rule. Future storage vessels installed at compressor stations in specific counties in the state may require additional controls depending on their size and throughput. Mexico jurisdictions • Federal: The General Climate Change Law (LGCC) establishes various public policy instruments, including the National Emissions Registry and its regulations, which allow for the compilation of information on the emission of compounds and GHG emissions of the different productive sectors of the country. The LGCC defines the National Inventory of Emissions as the document that contains the estimate of anthropogenic emissions by sources and absorption by sinks in Mexico. The LGCC has the objective to reduce national emissions, through policies and programs that promote the transition to a sustainable, competitive and lower-carbon economy, including market instruments, incentives and other alternatives that improve the cost-efficiency of specific mitigation measures, reducing their economic costs and promoting competitiveness, technology transfer and the promotion of technological development. This law requires annual reporting of our GHG emissions 112 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Page 115
• Federal: The Government of Mexico published a regulation in 2018 that established guidelines for the prevention and control of methane emissions from the hydrocarbon sector. Companies are required to prepare a Program for the Comprehensive Prevention and Control of Methane Emissions (PPCIEM) which includes identification of sources of methane, quantification of baseline emissions and an estimate of the expected GHG emission reductions from prevention and control activities. This regulation requires the PPCIEM, through which operational and technological practices are adopted, to determine a GHG emissions intensity reduction goal that must be met within a period not exceeding six calendar years from the delivery of the PPCIEM. TC Energy developed and applied the PPCIEM to all of its facilities in Mexico in 2020 • Federal : The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources published an agreement to progressively and gradually establish an emissions commerce system in Mexico and comply with the LGCC. It functioned as a three-year pilot from 2020 to 2022 allowing the Secretariat to test the design and rules of the system, as well as evaluate its performance and then propose adjustments for a subsequent operational phase after 2022. The Emission Rights Tracking System is the electronic platform where the emission rights and compensation credits are issued, transacted and cancelled, through which the participants interact to fulfill their obligations. It has already been formally established and it is possible that we will have to participate as a company if we exceed 100 ktCO 2 e in any of our systems. However, currently all our systems in Mexico are below the emissions threshold, so this instrument has not been used • Federal: The Mexican accounting and sustainability standard setter, Consejo Mexicano de Normas de Información Financiera y Sostenibilidad (CINIF), published the Mexican sustainability standards (Normas de Información de Sostenibilidad or NIS) applicable to all private entities that report their financial statements under Mexican Financial Reporting Standards. The NIS requires the disclosure of 30 sustainability indicators across environmental, social and governance topics for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. These requirements will apply to certain TC Energy Mexican entities. Anticipated policies Canadian jurisdictions • Federal: ECCC committed to expand on the current methane reduction regulations and released draft amendments in December 2023 to reduce the oil and gas sector methane emissions by at least 75 per cent below 2012 levels by 2030. The draft amendments introduce a risk-based approach for the detection and repair of fugitive emissions, prohibit all venting with specific exceptions and offer an alternative performance-based approach using continuous monitoring. TC Energy has identified several areas for improvement and clarification. We participated in the 2024 public consultation process and provided recommendations, in collaboration with industry associations. The updated regulations are expected to come into force January 1, 2027, with phased requirements through 2030. We will continue to refine our internal emissions management strategies and update our compliance plans to align with the anticipated regulatory changes • Federal: On November 9, 2024, ECCC published draft Oil and Gas Sector Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cap Regulations. The draft regulations introduce a cap-and-trade system to reduce GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector, covering upstream activities and LNG production. The initial 2030-2032 compliance period will limit emissions to 27 per cent below 2026 emissions levels with some limited compliance flexibilities. Canada would be the first major oil and gas producing country to impose such limits. Although transmission pipelines are excluded from the draft regulations, there is a possibility of cascading effects and unintended consequences to our business. The draft regulations are set to be finalized in 2025 and phased-in between 2026-2029. We continue to monitor, assess and provide feedback to ECCC, as appropriate • British Columbia: The BC Energy Regulator is implementing amended regulations effective January 1, 2025 to further reduce methane emissions from the province's upstream oil and gas sector, in support of the CleanBC Roadmap to 2030 target of a 75 per cent reduction. The amendments update the Drilling and Production Regulation, Oil and Gas Processing Facility Regulation and Pipeline Regulation under the Energy Resource Activities Act. These amendments will be applicable to Coastal GasLink operations. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 113

U.S. jurisdictions • Federal: The U.S. Senate passed the PHMSA reauthorization bill, the PIPES Act of 2020, which required PHMSA to promulgate gas pipeline leak detection and repair regulations. On May 4, 2023, PHMSA released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to regulate methane emissions from new and existing gas transmission, distribution and gas gathering pipelines and underground storage and LNG facilities. PHMSA’s NPRM provides limited exemption for compressor stations recognizing USEPA’s Methane Rule requirements. The cost of compliance due to the proposed PHMSA regulations is subject to issuance of a final rule, which remains pending, but is expected to increase significantly due to new monitoring and repair requirements applicable to the entire natural gas transmission system. On January 17, 2025, PHMSA transmitted the final rule to the Federal Register; however, it was not published prior to the inauguration of the incoming administration. On January 20, 2025, an Executive Order was issued placing a freeze on all pending regulations not published to the Federal Register for review. At this time, the final release date of the Leak Detection and Repair Rule is uncertain. TC Energy will continue to monitor the potential outcome of the regulations following federal direction and additional industry level discussions • Federal: On November 22, 2024, the USEPA proposed amendments to the Standards of Performance for new, modified, and reconstructed stationary gas turbines (under 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart KKKKa). These amendments aim to limit emissions of criteria air pollutants, particularly nitrogen oxide (NOx), by establishing size-based subcategories and recognizing distinctions between turbines operating at varying loads or capacity factors. The USEPA also proposes that the best system of emission reduction for NOX emissions includes combustion controls with post-combustion selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”). Potential impacts to TC Energy could include additional costs for installation of SCR and other ancillary costs for operational maintenance for new gas turbines that operate at low temperatures and high utilization. However, the proposed rule is still being assessed, and there is currently no effective date for the proposed rule • Michigan: The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) is currently evaluating RACT requirements and emission limitations for major stationary sources of NOx in specific counties of the state (2015 ozone non-attainment area). This will lead to the development of laws and regulations that affect TC Energy through impacted ANR and Great Lakes facilities in the state • New York: The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) are developing New York’s Cap-and-Invest Program (NYCI), proposed in 2023, to meet the Climate Act’s GHG reduction and equity requirements. The NYCI is anticipated to set an annual cap on the amount of GHG emissions that are permitted to be emitted in the state. Publication of a draft rule was expected in early 2025, but on January 15, 2025, New York Governor Hochul announced a pause to allow for additional information gathering and enhanced engagement, such that a compliance commencement date is indeterminate at this time. NYCI will potentially impact TC Energy owned/operated assets in New York, but impacts will be further evaluated once a draft rule is published • Oregon: The state has reintroduced rules for its Climate Protection Plan. The previous version was struck down by a state court on technical grounds. Like the previous rule, the draft language appears to exclude TC Energy emissions in the state, as it would exempt "Emissions from an air contamination source that is owned or operated by an interstate natural gas pipeline and that is operating under authority of a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission". Changes to environmental remediation regulations – U.S. Jurisdictions • Federal: The USEPA proposed a rule entitled, Alternate Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Extraction Methods and Amendments to PCB Cleanup and Disposal Regulations in 2021. The rule addresses a myriad of issues related to laboratory methodologies, performance-based disposal options for PCB remediation waste and emergency situations, among other proposed changes. USEPA finalized the rule in August 2023 and the rule became effective February 26, 2024. We will continue to assess the impact of the rule on future projects on a case-by-case basis, which will depend on the site- and project-specific considerations and remediation efforts on each project. In addition to the policies above, there are new mandatory climate-related disclosure requirements being issued in jurisdictions in which we operate. These disclosure requirements may impact how we report our climate-related risks and opportunities, strategy, risk management and GHG emission metrics and targets. We continue to monitor these developments and progress activities in anticipation of these new requirements. 114 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Other sustainability related regulations • In 2024, the Government of Canada passed Bill C-59 including a provision to amend the Competition Act targeting unsubstantiated claims about the environmental benefits of products or business activities, commonly known as “greenwashing.” The Bill C-59 greenwashing provision affects a wide range of industries and companies, including TC Energy. Following the passage of Bill C-59, the Competition Bureau of Canada conducted a public consultation on implementation guidance and enforcement of the greenwashing provision. TC Energy participated in the public consultation process and will continue to seek clarity on how the new legislation will be interpreted and applied. There are other sustainability-related disclosure requirements being issued in jurisdictions in which we operate. While these disclosure requirements do not necessarily apply to us, they may impact how we report on non-climate related sustainability risks, opportunities, strategies, governance and incidents. We continue to monitor these developments and progress activities related to these new and anticipated requirements. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 115

Financial risks We are exposed to various financial risks and have strategies, policies and limits in place to manage the impact of these risks on our earnings, cash flows and, ultimately, shareholder value. Risk management strategies, policies and limits are designed to ensure our risks and related exposures are in line with our business objectives and risk tolerance. Our risks are managed within limits that are established by our Board of Directors, implemented by senior management and monitored by our risk management, internal audit and business segment groups. Our Board of Directors' Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with risk management policies and procedures and oversees management's review of the adequacy of the risk management framework. Market risk We construct and invest in energy infrastructure projects, purchase and sell commodities, issue short- and long-term debt, including amounts in foreign currencies and invest in foreign operations. Certain of these activities expose us to market risk from changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which may affect our earnings, cash flows and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. We assess contracts used to manage market risk to determine whether all, or a portion, meet the definition of a derivative. Derivative contracts used to assist in managing exposure to market risk may include the following: • forwards and futures contracts – agreements to purchase or sell a specific financial instrument or commodity at a specified price and date in the future • swaps – agreements between two parties to exchange streams of payments over time according to specified terms • options – agreements that convey the right, but not the obligation of the purchaser, to buy or sell a specific amount of a financial instrument or commodity at a fixed price, either at a fixed date or at any time within a specified period. Commodity price risk The following strategies may be used to manage our exposure to market risk resulting from commodity price risk management activities in our non-regulated businesses: • in our natural gas marketing business, we enter into natural gas transportation and storage contracts, as well as natural gas purchase and sale agreements. We manage our exposure on these contracts using financial instruments and hedging activities to offset market price volatility • in our power business, we manage the exposure to fluctuating commodity prices through long-term contracts and hedging activities including selling and purchasing electricity and natural gas in forward markets • in our non-regulated natural gas storage business, our exposure to seasonal natural gas price spreads is managed with a portfolio of third-party storage capacity contracts and through offsetting purchases and sales of natural gas in forward markets to lock in future positive margins. Lower natural gas or electricity prices could lead to reduced investment in the development, expansion and production of these commodities. A reduction in the demand for these commodities could negatively impact opportunities to expand our asset base and/or re-contract with our shippers and customers as contractual agreements expire. Interest rate risk We utilize both short- and long-term debt to finance our operations which exposes us to interest rate risk. We typically pay fixed rates of interest on our long-term debt and floating rates on short-term debt including our commercial paper programs and amounts drawn on our credit facilities. A small portion of our long-term debt bears interest at floating rates. In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk on financial instruments and contractual obligations containing variable interest rate components. We actively manage our interest rate risk using interest rate derivatives. 116 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Foreign exchange risk Certain of our businesses generate all or most of their earnings in U.S. dollars and, since we report our financial results in Canadian dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar directly affect our comparable EBITDA and may also impact comparable earnings. A portion of our Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines monetary assets and liabilities are peso-denominated, while our Mexico operations' financial results are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar can affect our comparable earnings. In addition, foreign exchange gains or losses calculated for Mexico income tax purposes on the revaluation of U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities result in a peso-denominated income tax exposure for these entities, leading to fluctuations in Income (loss) from equity investments and Income tax expense (recovery) in the Consolidated statement of income. We actively manage a portion of our foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange derivatives. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. We hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations (on an after-tax basis) with U.S. dollar-denominated debt, cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange options, as appropriate. Counterparty credit risk We have exposure to counterparty credit risk in a number of areas including: • cash and cash equivalents • accounts receivable • available-for-sale assets • fair value of derivative assets • net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico. At times, our counterparties may endure financial challenges resulting from commodity price and market volatility, economic instability and political or regulatory changes. In addition to actively monitoring these situations, there are a number of factors that reduce our counterparty credit risk exposure in the event of default, including: • contractual rights and remedies together with the utilization of contractually-based financial assurances • current regulatory frameworks governing certain of our operations • the competitive position of our assets and the demand for our services • potential recovery of unpaid amounts through bankruptcy and similar proceedings. We review financial assets carried at amortized cost for impairment using the lifetime expected loss of the financial asset at initial recognition and throughout the life of the financial asset. We use historical credit loss and recovery data, adjusted for our judgment regarding current economic and credit conditions, along with reasonable and supportable forecasts to determine any impairment, which is recognized in Plant operating costs and other. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no significant credit risk concentrations, with the exception of the CFE, which represents approximately 33 per cent of the gross exposure. Gross exposure is measured as the unmitigated full-term contract revenue exposure discounted in accordance with each contract’s discount rate, as applicable. At this time, there were no significant amounts past due or impaired. We recorded a pre-tax recovery of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 on the expected credit loss provision before tax recognized on TGNH net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico (2023 – $80 million recovery). Other than the expected credit loss provision noted above, we had no significant credit losses at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 28, Risk management and financial instruments, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have significant credit and performance exposure to financial institutions that hold cash deposits and provide committed credit lines and letters of credit that help manage our exposure to counterparties and provide liquidity in commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate derivative markets. Our portfolio of financial sector exposure consists primarily of highly-rated investment grade, systemically important financial institutions.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they come due. We manage our liquidity risk by continuously forecasting our cash flows and ensuring we have adequate cash balances, cash flows from operations, committed and demand credit facilities and access to capital markets to meet our operating, financing and capital expenditure obligations under both normal and stressed economic conditions. Refer to the Financial Condition section for additional information. Legal proceedings TC Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, arbitrations and actions arising in the normal course of business. We assess all legal matters on an ongoing basis, including those of our equity investments to determine if they meet the requirements for disclosure or accrual of a contingent loss. With the potential exception of the matters discussed in Note 31, Commitments, contingencies and guarantees, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of such proceedings and actions will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The claims discussed in Note 31, Commitments, contingencies and guarantees, are material and there is a reasonable possibility of loss; however, they have not been assessed as probable and a reasonable estimate of loss cannot be made. 118 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We meet Canadian and U.S. regulatory requirements for disclosure controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and related CEO and CFO certifications. Disclosure controls and procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our President and CEO and our CFO, we carried out quarterly evaluations of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including for the year ended December 31, 2024, as required by the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and by the SEC. Based on this evaluation, our President and CEO and our CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in that they are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports we file with or send to securities regulatory authorities is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately within the time periods specified under Canadian and U.S. securities laws. Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, which is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our President and CEO and our CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our President and CEO and our CFO, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting was conducted as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2024, the internal control over financial reporting was effective. Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included in our 2024 Consolidated financial statements. CEO and CFO certifications Our President and CEO and our CFO have attested to the quality of the public disclosure in our fiscal 2024 reports filed with Canadian securities regulators and the SEC and have filed certifications with them. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There were no changes during the year covered by this annual report that had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our internal control over financial reporting. On October 1, 2024, we completed the Spinoff Transaction. In connection with the Spinoff Transaction, the internal controls associated with the Liquids Pipelines business were transferred to South Bow. We are contractually obligated to maintain adequate controls post-spinoff for the provision of services under the Transition Services Agreement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the amount and timing of recording assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses since the determination of these items may be dependent on future events. We use the most current information available and exercise careful judgment in making these estimates and assumptions. Certain estimates and judgments have a material impact where the assumptions underlying these accounting estimates relate to matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate or judgment is made or are subjective. Refer to Note 2, Accounting policies, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. Impairment of goodwill We test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances lead us to believe it might be impaired. We can initially assess qualitative factors which include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current valuation multiples and discount rates, cost factors, historical and forecasted financial results, or events specific to that reporting unit. If we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, we will then perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. We can elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test for any reporting unit. If the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including its goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill disposed is determined based on the relative fair values of the business to be disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on our projections of future cash flows, which involves making estimates and assumptions about transportation rates, market supply and demand, growth opportunities, output levels, competition from other companies, operating costs, regulatory changes, discount rates and earnings and other multiples. In the determination of the fair value utilized in the quantitative goodwill impairment test performed in 2023 for the Columbia reporting unit, we performed a discounted cash flow analysis using projections of future cash flows and applied a risk-adjusted discount rate and terminal value multiple which involved significant estimates and judgments. It was determined that the fair value of the Columbia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. Although goodwill was not impaired, the estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value was less than 10 per cent. There is a risk that reductions in future cash flow forecasts and adverse changes in other key assumptions could result in a future impairment of a portion of the goodwill balance relating to Columbia. In March 2022, an impairment loss was recognized for the excess carrying value over the estimated fair value of our Great Lakes reporting unit. There is a risk that reductions in future cash flow forecasts and adverse changes in other key assumptions could result in future impairment of the remaining goodwill balance. Qualitative goodwill impairment indicators As part of the annual goodwill impairment assessment at December 31, 2024, we evaluated qualitative factors impacting the fair value of the underlying reporting units. It was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. 120 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS With the exception of Long-term debt and Junior subordinated notes, our derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value unless they were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery in accordance with our normal purchase and sales exemptions and are documented as such. In addition, fair value accounting is not required for other financial instruments that qualify for certain accounting exemptions. Derivative instruments We use derivative instruments to reduce volatility associated with fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Derivative instruments, including those that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting treatment, are recorded at fair value. The majority of derivative instruments that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment have been entered into as economic hedges to manage our exposure to market risk and are classified as held-for-trading. Changes in the fair value of held-for-trading derivative instruments are recorded in net income in the period of change. This may expose us to increased variability in reported operating results since the fair value of the held-for-trading derivative instruments can fluctuate significantly from period to period. The recognition of gains and losses on derivatives for Canadian natural gas regulated pipeline exposures is determined through the regulatory process. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as part of RRA, including those that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, are expected to be refunded or recovered through the tolls charged by us. As a result, these gains and losses are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets and are refunded to or collected from the ratepayers in subsequent years when the derivative settles. Balance sheet presentation of derivative instruments The balance sheet presentation of the fair value of derivative instruments is as follows: at December 31 (millions of $) 2024 2023 Other current assets 347 589 Other long-term assets 122 155 Accounts payable and other (507) (415) Other long-term liabilities (209) (106) (247) 223 Anticipated timing of settlement of derivative instruments The anticipated timing of settlement of derivative instruments assumes constant commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Related party transactions are conducted in the normal course of business and are measured at the exchange amount, which is the amount of consideration established and agreed to by the related parties. Coastal GasLink LP We hold a 35 per cent equity interest in Coastal GasLink LP, and have been contracted to develop, construct and operate the Coastal GasLink pipeline. We have a subordinated loan agreement with Coastal GasLink LP under which we advance non-revolving interest-bearing loans subject to floating market-based rates. In December 2024, following the commercial in-service of the pipeline, Coastal GasLink LP repaid the $3,147 million balance outstanding to TC Energy under the subordinated loan agreement. This repayment reduced our funding commitment under the subordinated loan agreement to $228 million at December 31, 2024. We also have a subordinated demand revolving credit facility agreement with Coastal GasLink LP to provide additional short- term liquidity and funding flexibility to projects under construction. Refer to Note 7, Coastal GasLink, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information about Coastal GasLink LP related party transactions. Sur de Texas We hold a 60 per cent equity interest in a joint venture with IEnova to own the Sur de Texas pipeline, for which we are the operator. In 2017, we entered into a MXN$21.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the joint venture, which bore interest at a floating rate and was fully repaid upon maturity on March 15, 2022 in the amount of $1.2 billion. Our Consolidated statement of income reflects the related interest income and foreign exchange impact on this loan receivable until its repayment on March 15, 2022, which were fully offset upon consolidation with corresponding amounts included in our proportionate share of Sur de Texas equity earnings as follows: year ended December 31 Affected line item in the Consolidated statement of income (millions of $) 2024 2023 2022 Interest income 1 — — 19 Interest income and other Interest expense 2 — — (19) Income (loss) from equity investments Foreign exchange losses 1 — — (28) Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net Foreign exchange gains 1 — — 28 Income (loss) from equity investments 1 Included in our Corporate segment. 2 Included in our Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines segment. On March 15, 2022, as part of refinancing activities with the Sur de Texas joint venture, the peso-denominated inter-affiliate loan discussed above was replaced with a new U.S. dollar-denominated inter-affiliate loan from us of an equivalent $1.2 billion (US$938 million) with a floating interest rate. On July 29, 2022, the Sur de Texas joint venture entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with third parties, the proceeds of which were used to fully repay the U.S. dollar-denominated inter-affiliate loan with TC Energy.

Factors affecting quarterly financial information by business segment Quarter-over-quarter revenues and net income fluctuate for reasons that vary across our business segments. In addition to the factors below, our revenues and segmented earnings (losses) are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, mainly related to our U.S. dollar-denominated operations and our peso-denominated exposure. As discussed on page 10 of the About this document section, results of the Liquids Pipelines business were accounted for as a discontinued operation starting October 1, 2024. To allow for a meaningful comparison, discussions throughout the Quarterly results section are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Prior year results have been recast to reflect the split between continuing and discontinued operations. Discontinued operations reflect nine months of Liquids Pipelines earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a full year of Liquids earnings in 2023. Refer to the Discontinued operations section for additional information. In our Natural Gas Pipelines business, except for seasonal fluctuations in short-term throughput volumes on U.S. pipelines, quarter-over-quarter revenues and segmented earnings (losses) generally remain relatively stable during any fiscal year. Over the long term, however, they fluctuate because of: • regulatory decisions • negotiated settlements with customers • newly constructed assets being placed in service • acquisitions and divestitures • natural gas marketing activities and commodity prices • developments outside of the normal course of operations • certain fair value adjustments • provisions for expected credit losses on net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico. In Power and Energy Solutions, quarter-over-quarter revenues and segmented earnings are affected by: • weather • customer demand • newly constructed assets being placed in service • acquisitions and divestitures • market prices for natural gas and power • capacity prices and payments • power marketing and trading activities • planned and unplanned plant outages • developments outside of the normal course of operations • certain fair value adjustments. Factors affecting financial information by quarter We calculate comparable measures by adjusting certain GAAP measures for specific items we believe are significant but not reflective of our underlying operations in the period. Except as otherwise described herein, these comparable measures are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period, as applicable. Refer to page 24 for more information on non-GAAP measures we use. In fourth quarter 2024, comparable earnings from continuing operations also excluded: • a pre-tax net gain on debt extinguishment of $228 million (after-tax $178 million) related to the purchase and cancellation of certain senior unsecured notes and medium term notes and the retirement of outstanding callable notes in October 2024 • pre-tax unrealized foreign exchange gains, net of $143 million (after-tax $153 million) on the peso-denominated intercompany loan between TCPL and TGNH, net of non-controlling interest • a pre-tax recovery of $3 million (after-tax $2 million) on the expected credit loss provision related to TGNH net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico, net of non-controlling interest • a deferred income tax expense of $96 million resulting from the revaluation of remaining deferred tax balances following the Spinoff Transaction • a pre-tax impairment charge of $36 million (after-tax $27 million) related to development costs incurred on Project Tundra, a next-generation technology carbon capture and storage project, following our decision to end our collaboration on the project • a pre-tax expense of $9 million (after-tax $7 million) related to Focus Project costs.

In addition, we retired outstanding callable notes at par. These extinguishments of debt resulted in a pre-tax net gain of $228 million, primarily due to fair value discounts and unamortized debt issue costs. The net gain on debt extinguishment was recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated statement of income. Refer to the Financial condition section for additional information. 3 In 2023, TCPL and TGNH became party to an unsecured revolving credit facility. The loan receivable and loan payable are eliminated upon consolidation; however, due to differences in the currency that each entity reports its financial results, there is an impact to net income reflecting the revaluation and translation of the loan receivable and loan payable to TC Energy's reporting currency. As the amounts do not accurately reflect what will be realized at settlement, we exclude from comparable measures the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on the loan receivable, as well as the corresponding unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on the loan payable, net of non-controlling interest. 4 In 2022, TGNH and the CFE executed agreements which consolidate several natural gas pipelines under one TSA. As this TSA contains a lease, we have recognized amounts in net investment in leases on our Consolidated balance sheet. As required by U.S. GAAP, we have recognized an expected credit loss provision related to net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico, which will fluctuate from period to period based on changing economic assumptions and forward-looking information. This provision is an estimate of losses that may occur over the duration of the TSA through 2055. This provision does not reflect losses or cash outflows that were incurred under this lease arrangement in the current period or from our underlying operations, and therefore, we have excluded any unrealized changes, net of non-controlling interest, from comparable measures. Refer to Note 28, Risk management and financial instruments, for additional information. 5 In 2022, we launched the Focus Project with benefits in the form of enhanced safety, productivity and cost-effectiveness expected to be realized in the future. Beginning in 2023, we recognized expenses in Plant operating costs and other, for external consulting and severance, some of which are not recoverable through regulatory and commercial tolling structures.

Comparable EBITDA from continuing operations Fourth quarter 2024 versus fourth quarter 2023 Comparable EBITDA from continuing operations decreased by $96 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the net effect of the following: • decreased EBITDA in Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines mainly due to lower earnings from Coastal GasLink related to the recognition of a $200 million incentive payment in 2023, partially offset by higher flow-through costs on the NGTL System • decreased U.S. dollar-denominated EBITDA from U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines mainly as a result of the sale of PNGTS, which was completed on August 15, 2024, lower realized earnings related to our U.S. natural gas marketing business primarily due to lower margins and lower equity earnings from Iroquois, partially offset by incremental earnings from growth projects placed in service and additional contract sales • increased Power and Energy Solutions EBITDA primarily attributable to higher contributions from Bruce Power due to higher generation, a higher contract price and lower outage costs, partially offset by decreased Canadian Power earnings primarily due to lower realized power prices, net of lower natural gas fuel costs • increased U.S. dollar-denominated EBITDA from Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines primarily due to higher equity earnings from Sur de Texas as a result of the impact of peso-denominated financial exposure and lower income tax expense, partially offset by lower earnings in TGNH primarily related to higher operating costs • the positive foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the Canadian dollar equivalent comparable EBITDA in our U.S. dollar-denominated operations. U.S. dollar-denominated comparable EBITDA decreased by US$27 million compared to 2023 and was translated at a rate of 1.40 in 2024 versus 1.36 in 2023. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. Due to the flow-through treatment of certain costs including income taxes, financial charges and depreciation in our Canadian rate-regulated pipelines, changes in these costs impact our comparable EBITDA despite having no significant effect on net income. Comparable earnings from continuing operations Fourth quarter 2024 versus fourth quarter 2023 Comparable earnings from continuing operations decreased by $98 million or $0.10 per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and was primarily the net effect of: • changes in comparable EBITDA described above • higher interest expense primarily due to lower capitalized interest, interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in 2023 and lower interest rates on increased levels of short-term borrowing, partially offset by long-term debt repayments, net of issuances and realized gains from risk management activities used to manage our interest rate risk • higher AFUDC primarily due to spending on the Southeast Gateway pipeline project, partially offset by projects placed in service • risk management activities used to manage our foreign exchange exposure to net liabilities in Mexico and to U.S. dollar‑denominated income and the revaluation of our peso-denominated net monetary liabilities to U.S. dollars • lower income tax expense due to lower earnings subject to income tax and Mexico foreign exchange exposure, partially offset by lower foreign income tax rate differentials and higher flow-through income taxes • higher net income attributable to non-controlling interests primarily due to the sale of a 13.01 per cent non-controlling equity interest in TGNH to the CFE completed in second quarter 2024, lower taxable earnings from the Texas Wind Farms and a stronger U.S. dollar on translation of U.S. dollar-denominated net income attributable to non-controlling interests. 130 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Foreign exchange Certain of our businesses generate all or most of their earnings in U.S. dollars and, since we report our financial results in Canadian dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar directly affect our comparable EBITDA and may also impact comparable earnings. As our U.S. dollar-denominated operations continue to grow, this exposure increases. A portion of the U.S. dollar-denominated comparable EBITDA exposure is naturally offset by U.S. dollar-denominated amounts below comparable EBITDA within Depreciation and amortization, Interest expense and other income statement line items. A portion of the remaining exposure is actively managed on a rolling forward basis up to three years using foreign exchange derivatives; however, the natural exposure beyond that period remains. The net impact of the U.S. dollar movements on comparable earnings during the three months ended December 31, 2024 after considering natural offsets and economic hedges was not significant. The components of our financial results denominated in U.S. dollars are set out in the table below, including our U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines and Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines operations. Comparable EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Pre-tax U.S. dollar-denominated income and expense items - from continuing operations three months ended December 31 (millions of US$) 2024 2023 1 Comparable EBITDA U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines 859 900 Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines 167 153 1,026 1,053 Depreciation and amortization (191) (192) Interest expense on long-term debt and junior subordinated notes (440) (473) Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations — 47 Allowance for funds used during construction 159 81 Net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests included in comparable earnings and other (125) (92) 429 424 Average exchange rate - U.S. to Canadian dollars 1.40 1.36 1 Prior year results have been recast to reflect continuing operations only. Foreign exchange related to Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines Changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar can affect our comparable earnings as a portion of our Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines monetary assets and liabilities are peso-denominated, while our financial results are denominated in U.S. dollars for our Mexico operations. These peso-denominated balances are revalued to U.S. dollars, creating foreign exchange gains and losses that are included in Income (loss) from equity investments, Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net and Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in the Consolidated statement of income. In addition, foreign exchange gains or losses calculated for Mexico income tax purposes on the revaluation of U.S. dollar‑denominated monetary assets and liabilities result in a peso-denominated income tax exposure for these entities, leading to fluctuations in Income from equity investments and Income tax expense. This exposure increases as our U.S. dollar‑denominated net monetary liabilities grow. The above exposures are managed using foreign exchange derivatives, although some unhedged exposure remains. The impacts of the foreign exchange derivatives are recorded in Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated statement of income.

Highlights by business segment Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings decreased by $186 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net income for the NGTL System decreased by $8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 mainly due to incentive losses. The NGTL System was operating under the 2020-2024 Revenue Requirement Settlement which included an approved ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity. This settlement provided the NGTL System the opportunity to increase depreciation rates if tolls fall below specified levels and an incentive mechanism for certain operating costs where variances from projected amounts are shared with our customers. Net income for the Canadian Mainline increased by $7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 mainly due to higher incentive earnings. The Canadian Mainline is operating under the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement which includes an approved ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity and an incentive to decrease costs and increase revenues on the pipeline under a beneficial sharing mechanism with our customers. Comparable EBITDA for Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines decreased by $183 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the net effect of: • earnings from Coastal GasLink in 2023 related to the recognition of a $200 million incentive payment upon meeting certain milestones • higher flow-through income taxes and depreciation on the NGTL System, partially offset by incentive losses. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was largely consistent with the same period in 2023. U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings decreased by $37 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and included unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives related to our U.S. natural gas marketing business, which have been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT. A stronger U.S. dollar for the three months ended December 31, 2024 had a positive impact on the Canadian dollar equivalent segmented earnings from our U.S. dollar-denominated operations. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. Comparable EBITDA for U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines decreased by US$41 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and was primarily due to the net effect of: • decreased earnings as a result of the sale of our 61.7 per cent equity interest in PNGTS, which was completed on August 15, 2024 • lower realized earnings related to our U.S. natural gas marketing business, primarily due to lower margins • lower equity earnings from Iroquois • decreased earnings due to higher operational costs, reflective of increased system utilization across our footprint • incremental earnings from growth and modernization projects placed in service, as well as increased earnings from additional contract sales on ANR. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was largely consistent with the same period in 2023. TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024 | 133

Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings increased by $64 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and included an unrealized recovery of $3 million (2023 – unrealized loss of $36 million), on the expected credit loss provision related to TGNH net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico, which has been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT. Refer to Note 28, Risk management and financial instruments, of our 2024 Consolidated financial statements for additional information. A stronger U.S. dollar for the three months ended December 31, 2024 had a positive impact on the Canadian dollar equivalent segmented earnings from our U.S. dollar-denominated operations in Mexico. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information. Comparable EBITDA for Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines increased by US$14 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the net effect of: • higher equity earnings in Sur de Texas primarily due to the foreign exchange impacts upon the revaluation of peso-denominated liabilities as a result of a weaker Mexican peso and lower income tax expense mainly due to foreign exchange impacts. We use foreign exchange derivatives to manage this exposure, the impact of which is recognized in Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated statement of income. Refer to the Foreign exchange section for additional information • lower earnings in TGNH primarily related to higher operating costs from integrity activities performed in fourth quarter 2024. Depreciation and amortization was consistent for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Power and Energy Solutions Power and Energy Solutions segmented earnings increased by $13 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and included the following specific items which have been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT: • a pre-tax impairment charge of $36 million related to development costs incurred on Project Tundra, a next-generation technology carbon capture and storage project, following our decision to end our collaboration on the project • our proportionate share of Bruce Power's unrealized gains and losses on funds invested for post-retirement benefits and risk management activities • unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce commodity exposures. Comparable EBITDA for Power and Energy Solutions increased by $75 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the net effect of: • improved contributions from Bruce Power primarily due to increased generation, a higher contract price and lower outage costs, partially offset by increased operating and depreciation costs. Refer to the Bruce Power section for additional information • decreased Canadian Power financial results primarily from lower realized power prices, net of lower natural gas fuel costs. Depreciation and amortization was consistent for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Corporate Corporate segmented losses decreased by $18 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Corporate segmented losses included a pre-tax charge of $9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 (2023 – $15 million) related to Focus Project costs, which has been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT. Comparable EBITDA for Corporate was a loss of $7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to a loss of $18 million for the same period in 2023 and includes shared costs in 2023 related to TC Energy's corporate services and governance functions that were not allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to the Discontinued operations section for additional information. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was largely consistent with the same period in 2023. 134 | TC Energy Management's discussion and analysis 2024

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) included in this Annual Report are the responsibility of the management of TC Energy Corporation (TC Energy or the Company) and have been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include amounts that are based on estimates and judgments. The MD&A is based on the Company's financial results. It compares the Company's financial and operating performance in 2024 to that in 2023, and highlights significant changes between 2023 and 2022. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Financial information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management has designed and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting, including a program of internal audits to carry out its responsibility. Management believes these controls provide reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable and form a proper basis for the preparation of financial statements. The internal control over financial reporting includes management's communication to employees of policies that govern ethical business conduct. Under the supervision and with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management concluded, based on its evaluation, that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes. The Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and approving the consolidated financial statements and MD&A and ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and internal control. The Board of Directors carries out these responsibilities primarily through the Audit Committee, which consists of independent, non-management directors. The Audit Committee meets with management at least four times a year and meets independently with internal and external auditors and as a group to review any significant accounting, internal control and auditing matters in accordance with the terms of the Charter of the Audit Committee, which is set out in the Annual Information Form. The Audit Committee's responsibilities include overseeing management's performance in carrying out its financial reporting responsibilities and reviewing the Annual Report, including the consolidated financial statements and MD&A, before these documents are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. The internal and independent external auditors have access to the Audit Committee without the requirement to obtain prior management approval. The Audit Committee approves the terms of engagement of the independent external auditors and reviews the annual audit plan, the Auditors' Report and the results of the audit. It also recommends to the Board of Directors the firm of external auditors to be appointed by the shareholders. The shareholders have appointed KPMG LLP as independent external auditors to express an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with GAAP. The reports of KPMG LLP outline the scope of its examinations and its opinions on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors TC Energy Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TC Energy Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements; and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for the Columbia and ANR reporting units As discussed in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of December 31, 2024 for the Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. (Columbia) and the American Natural Resources (ANR) reporting units was $10,588 million and $2,803 million, respectively. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, might be impaired. The Company performed qualitative assessments to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the Columbia and ANR reporting units’ goodwill might be impaired. These qualitative assessments were performed as of December 31, 2024. 140 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Page 143
We identified the evaluation of qualitative goodwill impairment indicators, or qualitative factors, for the Columbia and ANR reporting units as a critical audit matter. The assessment of the potential impact that these qualitative factors have on a reporting unit’s fair value required the application of subjective auditor judgment. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, valuation multiples and discount rates, cost factors, historical and forecasted financial results and events specific to the reporting units, which required a higher degree of auditor judgment to evaluate. These qualitative factors could have had a significant effect on the Company’s qualitative assessment and the potential for the need to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. In addition, the audit effort associated with this evaluation required specialized skills and knowledge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment process, including controls related to the assessment of potential qualitative factors. We evaluated the Company’s assessment of identified event-specific changes against our knowledge of event-specific changes obtained through other audit procedures. We evaluated information from analyst reports in the energy and utility industries, including global energy consumption forecasts and natural gas production forecasts, which were compared to geopolitical and market considerations used by the Company. We compared the current valuation multiples and discount rates, cost factors, historical and forecasted financial results of the reporting units, including the impact of newly approved growth projects, to assumptions used in the quantitative goodwill impairment tests performed in a previous period. In addition, we involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: • evaluating the Company’s determination of the valuation multiples by comparing them to independently observed, recent market transactions of comparable assets and using publicly available market data for comparable entities • evaluating the discount rates used by management in the assessment, by comparing them against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities. /s/ KPMG LLP Chartered Professional Accountants We have served as the Company's auditor since 1956.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors TC Energy Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited TC Energy Corporation’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in the Company's Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Chartered Professional Accountants Calgary, Canada February 13, 2025 142 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

These assets are located in Alberta, Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick and Texas. In addition, TC Energy has physical and virtual power purchase agreements (PPAs) in Canada and the U.S. to buy and/or sell power from wind and solar facilities. These PPAs have the potential to be leases, derivatives or revenue arrangements depending on the contractual terms of the agreement. Spinoff of Liquids Pipelines Business On July 27, 2023, TC Energy announced plans to separate into two independent, investment-grade, publicly listed companies through the spinoff of its Liquids Pipelines business. TC Energy shareholders voted to approve the plan in June 2024 and, on October 1, 2024, TC Energy completed the spinoff of its Liquids Pipelines business into the new public company, South Bow Corporation (South Bow) (the Spinoff Transaction). TC Energy shareholders as of September 25, 2024 received one new TC Energy common share and 0.2 of a South Bow common share in exchange for each TC Energy common share held. TC Energy common shares resumed regular way trading on the TSX and NYSE on October 2, 2024. South Bow's common shares commenced regular way trading on the TSX on October 2, 2024 and on the NYSE on October 8, 2024, under the ticker symbol SOBO.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TC Energy and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) for which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary as well as voting interest entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. To the extent there are interests owned by other parties, these interests are included in non-controlling interests. TC Energy uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures in which the Company is able to exercise joint control and for investments in which the Company is able to exercise significant influence. The Spinoff Transaction represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company's operations and consolidated financial results. Accordingly, the historical results of the Liquids Pipelines business are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations and segment disclosures for all periods presented. The Notes to the consolidated financial statements reflect continuing operations only, unless otherwise indicated. Prior to the spinoff, the operations of the Liquids Pipelines business were materially reported as the Company's Liquids Pipelines segment. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued operations, and Note 5, Segmented information, for additional information. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Use of Estimates and Judgments In preparing these consolidated financial statements, TC Energy is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the amount and timing of recording assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses since the determination of these items may be dependent on future events. The Company uses the most current information available and exercises careful judgment in making these estimates and assumptions. Certain estimates and judgments have a material impact where the assumptions underlying these accounting estimates relate to matters that are highly uncertain at the time they are made or are subjective. These estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the assessment of goodwill impairment indicators and fair value of reporting units that contain goodwill (Note 14). Some of the estimates and judgments the Company has to make have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, but do not involve significant subjectivity or uncertainty. These estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to: • provisions for indemnities related to the South Bow Separation Agreement (Note 4) • recoverability and depreciation rates of plant, property and equipment (Note 9) • allocation of consideration to lease and non-lease components in a contract that contains a lease (Note 10) • assumptions used to measure the carrying amount of and expected credit losses on net investment in leases and certain contract assets (Notes 10 and 28) • fair value of equity investments (Note 11) • carrying value of regulatory assets and liabilities (Note 13) • recognition of asset retirement obligations (Note 18) • provisions for income taxes, including valuation allowances and releases as well as tax positions that may be reviewed as part of an audit by tax authorities (Note 19) • assumptions used to measure retirement and other post-retirement benefit obligations (Note 27) • fair value of financial instruments (Note 28) • fair value of Fluvanna Wind Farm and Blue Cloud Wind Farm (Texas Wind Farms) assets (Note 30) • commitments and provisions for contingencies and guarantees (Note 31). TC Energy continues to assess climate-related impacts on the consolidated financial statements. There are ongoing developments in the ESG frameworks and regulatory initiatives that could further impact accounting estimates and judgments including, but not limited to, assessment of asset useful lives, goodwill valuation, impairment of plant, property and equipment, accrued environmental costs and asset retirement obligations. The impact of these changes is continuously assessed to ensure any changes in assumptions that would impact estimates listed above are adjusted on a timely basis. Actual results could differ from these estimates. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 149

Regulation Certain Canadian, U.S. and Mexico natural gas pipeline and storage assets are regulated with respect to construction, operations and the determination of tolls. In Canada, regulated natural gas pipelines are subject to the authority of the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), the Alberta Energy Regulator or the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission. In the U.S., regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and regulated natural gas storage assets are subject to the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In Mexico, regulated natural gas pipelines are subject to the authority of the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE). Rate-regulated accounting (RRA) standards may impact the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in TC Energy's rate-regulated businesses which may differ from that otherwise recognized in non-rate-regulated businesses to reflect the economic impact of the regulators' decisions regarding revenues and tolls. Regulatory assets represent costs that are expected to be recovered in customer rates in future periods and regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be returned to customers through future rate-setting processes. An operation qualifies for the use of RRA when it meets three criteria: • a regulator must establish or approve the rates for the regulated services or activities • the regulated rates must be designed to recover the cost of providing the services or products • it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels to recover the cost can be charged to and collected from customers because of the demand for services or products and the level of direct or indirect competition. TC Energy's businesses that apply RRA currently include natural gas pipelines in Canada, U.S. and Mexico and regulated U.S. natural gas storage. Revenue Recognition The total consideration for services and products to which the Company expects to be entitled can include fixed and variable amounts. The Company has variable revenue that is subject to factors outside the Company's influence, such as market prices, actions of third parties and weather conditions. The Company considers this variable revenue to be "constrained" as it cannot be reliably estimated and, therefore, recognizes variable revenue when the service is provided. Revenues from contracts with customers are recognized net of any commodity taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company's contracts with customers include natural gas pipelines capacity arrangements and transportation contracts, power generation contracts, natural gas storage and other contracts. Revenues from non-lease components associated with a lease arrangement are recognized systematically over the term of the contract. The majority of income earned from marketing activities, as it relates to the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity, is recorded on a net basis in the month of delivery. Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines Capacity Arrangements and Transportation Revenues from the Company's Canadian natural gas pipelines are generated from contractual arrangements for committed capacity and from the transportation of natural gas. Revenues earned from firm contracted capacity arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the contract regardless of the amount of natural gas that is transported. Transportation revenues for interruptible or volumetric-based services are recognized when the service is performed. Revenues from the Company's Canadian natural gas pipelines under federal jurisdiction are subject to regulatory decisions by the CER. The tolls charged on these pipelines are based on revenue requirements designed to recover the costs of providing natural gas capacity for transportation services, which includes a return of and on capital, as approved by the CER. The Company's Canadian natural gas pipelines are generally not subject to earnings volatility related to variances in revenues and costs. These variances, except as related to incentive arrangements, are generally subject to deferral treatment and are recovered or refunded in future tolls. Revenues recognized prior to a CER decision on rates for that period reflect the CER's last approved return on equity (ROE) assumptions. Adjustments to revenues are recorded when the CER decision is received. Canadian natural gas pipelines' revenues are invoiced and received on a monthly basis. The Company does not take ownership of the natural gas that it transports for customers. 150 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Other Through the year, the Company was contracted to provide pipeline construction services to a partially-owned entity for a development fee. The development fee was considered variable consideration due to refund provisions in the contract. The Company recognized its estimate of the most likely amount of the variable consideration to which it was entitled. The development fee was recognized over time as the services were provided based on the input method using an estimate of activity level. U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines Capacity Arrangements and Transportation Revenues from the Company's U.S. natural gas pipelines are generated from contractual arrangements for committed capacity and from the transportation of natural gas. Revenues earned from firm contracted capacity arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract regardless of the amount of natural gas that is transported. Transportation revenues for interruptible or volumetric-based services are recognized when the service is performed. The Company's U.S. interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to FERC regulations and, as a result, a portion of revenues collected may be subject to refund if invoiced during an interim period when a rate proceeding is ongoing. Allowances for these potential refunds are recognized using management's best estimate based on the facts and circumstances of the proceeding. Any allowances that are recognized during the proceeding process are refunded or retained at the time a regulatory decision becomes final. U.S. natural gas pipelines' revenues are invoiced and received on a monthly basis. The Company does not take ownership of the natural gas that it transports for customers. Natural Gas Storage and Other Revenues from the Company's regulated U.S. natural gas storage services are generated mainly from firm committed capacity storage contracts. The performance obligation in these contracts is the reservation of a specified amount of capacity for storage including specifications with regard to the amount of natural gas that can be injected or withdrawn on a daily basis. Revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period for firm committed capacity regardless of the amount of natural gas that is stored, and when gas is injected or withdrawn for interruptible or volumetric-based services. Natural gas storage services revenues are invoiced and received on a monthly basis. The Company does not take ownership of the natural gas that it stores for customers. The Company owns mineral rights associated with certain natural gas storage facilities. These mineral rights can be leased or contributed to producers of natural gas in return for a royalty interest which is recognized when natural gas and associated liquids are produced. Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines Capacity Arrangements and Transportation Revenues from certain of the Company's Mexico natural gas pipelines are primarily collected based on CRE-approved negotiated firm capacity contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Transportation revenues related to interruptible or volumetric-based services are recognized when the service is performed. Mexico natural gas pipelines' revenues are invoiced and received on a monthly basis. The Company does not take ownership of the natural gas that it transports for customers. Other The Company generates revenues from operating and maintenance services provided on leased pipelines. Revenues earned from these services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 151

Power and Energy Solutions Power Revenues from the Company's Power and Energy Solutions business are primarily derived from long-term contractual commitments to provide power capacity to meet the demands of the market and from the sale of electricity to both centralized markets and to customers. Power generation revenues also include revenues from the sale of steam to customers. Revenues and capacity payments are recognized as the services are provided and as electricity and steam is delivered. Power generation revenues are invoiced and received on a monthly basis. Natural Gas Storage and Other Non-regulated natural gas storage contracts include park, loan and term storage arrangements. Revenues are recognized as the services are provided. Term storage revenues are invoiced and received on a monthly basis. Revenues from ancillary services are recognized as the service is provided. The Company does not take ownership of the natural gas that it stores for customers. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company's Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Inventories Inventories primarily consist of materials and supplies including spare parts and fuel, proprietary natural gas inventory in storage and emissions allowances and credits not held for compliance. The Company purchases certain emissions allowances and credits as part of bundled arrangements that also include the purchase of electricity for a fixed price. The cost allocated to emissions allowances and credits under such arrangements is based on observable market prices. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Assets Held for Sale The Company classifies assets as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a disposal group and expects the sale to close within the next 12 months. Upon classifying an asset as held for sale, the asset is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, net of selling costs and any losses are recognized in net income. Gains related to the expected sale of these assets are not recognized until the transaction closes. Once an asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded. Plant, Property and Equipment Natural Gas Pipelines Plant, property and equipment for natural gas pipelines is carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis once the assets are ready for their intended use. Pipeline and compression equipment are depreciated at annual rates ranging from 0.75 per cent to 6.67 per cent and metering and other plant equipment are depreciated at various rates reflecting their estimated useful lives. The cost of major overhauls of equipment is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated service lives of the overhauls. The cost of regulated natural gas pipelines includes an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) consisting of a debt component and an equity component based on the rate of return on rate base approved by regulators. AFUDC is reflected as an increase in the cost of the assets in Plant, property and equipment with a corresponding credit recognized in Allowance for funds used during construction in the Consolidated statement of income. The equity component of AFUDC is a non-cash expenditure. Interest is capitalized during construction of non-regulated natural gas pipelines. Natural gas pipelines' linepack and natural gas storage base gas are valued at cost and are maintained to ensure adequate pressure exists to transport natural gas through pipelines and deliver natural gas held in storage. Linepack and base gas are not depreciated. When rate-regulated natural gas pipelines retire plant, property and equipment from service, the original book cost is removed from the gross plant amount and recorded as a reduction to accumulated depreciation with no amount recorded to net income. Costs incurred to remove plant, property and equipment from service, net of any salvage proceeds, are also recorded in accumulated depreciation. 152 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Other The Company participates as a working interest partner in the development of certain Marcellus and Utica acreage. The working interest allows the Company to invest in drilling activities in addition to receiving a royalty interest in well production. The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil resulting from its portion of drilling activities. Capitalized well costs are depleted based on the units of production method. Power and Energy Solutions Plant, property and equipment for Power and Energy Solutions assets are recorded at cost and, once the assets are ready for their intended use, depreciated by major component on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives at average annual rates ranging from two per cent to 20 per cent. Other equipment is depreciated at various rates reflecting their estimated useful lives. The cost of major overhauls of equipment is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated service lives of the overhauls. Interest is capitalized on facilities under construction. When these assets are retired from plant, property and equipment, the original book cost and related accumulated depreciation are derecognized and any gain or loss is recorded in net income. Natural gas storage base gas, which is valued at original cost, represents gas volumes that are maintained to ensure adequate reservoir pressure exists to deliver gas held in storage. Base gas is not depreciated. Corporate Corporate plant, property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life at average annual rates ranging from four per cent to 20 per cent. Capital Projects in Development The Company capitalizes project costs once advancement of the project to construction stage is probable or costs are otherwise likely to be recoverable. The Company capitalizes interest costs for non-regulated projects in development and AFUDC for regulated projects in development. Capital projects in development are included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated balance sheet. These represent larger projects that generally require regulatory or other approvals before physical construction can begin. Once approvals are received, projects are moved to plant, property and equipment under construction. Leases The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception of a contract by using judgment in assessing the following aspects: 1) the contract specifies an identified asset which is physically distinct or, if not physically distinct, represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset; 2) the contract provides the customer with the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and 3) the customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of the contract. If the contract is determined to contain a lease, further judgment is required to identify separate lease components of the arrangement by assessing whether the lessee can benefit from the right of use either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the lessee, as well as if the right of use is neither highly dependent on, nor highly interrelated, with the other rights to use the underlying assets in the contract. The Company considers non-lease components as distinct elements of a contract that are not related to the use of the leased asset. A good or service that is provided to a customer is distinct if: 1) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and 2) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company applies the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all lessee contracts and facilities for which the Company is the lessor in an operating lease.

Lessee Accounting Policy Operating leases are recognized as right-of-use (ROU) assets and included in Plant, property and equipment while corresponding liabilities are included in Accounts payable and other and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date of the lease agreement. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. As the Company's lease contracts do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in Plant operating costs and other in the Consolidated statement of income. The Company applies the practical expedient to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases that qualify for the short-term lease recognition exemption. Lessor Accounting Policy The Company provides transportation and other services on certain assets to customers according to long-term service agreements through sales-type and operating leases. In a sales-type lease, the Company measures the total consideration within the contract at lease commencement. When a lease arrangement contains more than one lease and/or non-lease component, a portion of the contract consideration is allocated to each component based on the stand-alone selling price for each distinct service. The Company applies judgment to determine reasonable estimates of the expected future cost of satisfying the performance obligations of each service. The payments associated with lease components are apportioned between a reduction in the lease receivable and sales-type lease income. At lease commencement, the Company recognizes a net investment in lease represented by the present value of both the future lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased asset. The plant, property and equipment of the leased asset is derecognized, with related gains/losses, if any, recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. Sales-type lease income is determined using the rate implicit in the lease and is recorded in Revenues. The Company is the lessor within certain other contracts, including PPAs, that are accounted for as operating leases. In an operating lease, the leased asset remains capitalized in Plant, property and equipment on the Consolidated balance sheet and is depreciated over its useful life, while lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. Variable lease payments are recognized as income in the period in which they occur. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets such as plant, property and equipment and capital projects in development for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the total of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for an asset within plant, property and equipment, or the estimated selling price of any long-lived asset is less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairment of Equity Method Investments The Company reviews equity method investments for impairment when an event or change in circumstances has a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value. Where the Company concludes an investment's fair value is below its carrying value, the Company then determines whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, and if so, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the investment, not exceeding the carrying value of the investment. Acquisitions and Goodwill The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities are primarily measured at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is classified as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. 154 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Page 157
The annual review for goodwill impairment is performed at the reporting unit level which is one level below the Company's operating segments. The Company can initially assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The factors the Company considers include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current valuation multiples and discount rates, cost factors, historical and forecasted financial results and events specific to that reporting unit. If the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, the Company will then perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company can elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units. If the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including its goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires the use of assumptions that may include, but are not limited to, revenue and capital expenditure projections, valuation multiples and discount rates. The Company has elected to allocate goodwill impairment charges first to goodwill that is non-deductible for income tax purposes, with any remaining charge allocated to tax-deductible goodwill. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill disposed is determined based on the relative fair values of the business to be disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. A goodwill impairment test will be completed for both the goodwill disposed and the portion of the goodwill that will be retained. Non-Controlling Interests Non-controlling interests (NCI) represent third-party ownership interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. Partial dispositions which result in a change in the Company's ownership interest, but do not result in a change in control, of a subsidiary that constitutes a business are accounted for as equity transactions. No gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At the time of partial disposition, NCI is recorded as the third party's ownership interest in the Company's carrying value of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in Additional paid-in capital and/or Retained earnings (Accumulated deficit). Loans and Receivables Loans receivable from affiliates and accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost. Impairment of Financial Assets The Company reviews financial assets, inclusive of net investment in leases and certain contract assets, carried at amortized cost for impairment using the lifetime expected loss of the financial asset at initial recognition and throughout the life of the financial asset. An expected credit loss (ECL) is calculated using a model and methodology based on assumptions and judgment considering historical data, current counterparty information as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The ECL is recognized in Plant operating costs and other in the Consolidated statement of income, and is presented on the Consolidated balance sheet as a reduction to the carrying value of the related financial asset. Restricted Investments The Company has certain investments that are restricted as to their withdrawal and use. These restricted investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the CER’s Land Matters Consultation Initiative (LMCI), TC Energy is required to collect funds to cover estimated future pipeline abandonment costs for larger CER-regulated Canadian pipelines. Funds collected are placed in trusts that hold and invest the funds and are accounted for as restricted investments (LMCI restricted investments). LMCI restricted investments may only be used to fund the abandonment of the CER-regulated pipeline facilities, therefore, a corresponding regulatory liability is recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company also has other restricted investments that have been set aside to fund insurance claim losses to be paid by the Company's wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 155

Page 158
Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates at the balance sheet date that are anticipated to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. Changes to these balances are recognized in net income in the period in which they occur, except for changes in balances related to regulated natural gas pipelines which are deferred until they are refunded or recovered in tolls, as permitted by the regulator. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s exposure to uncertain tax positions is evaluated and a provision is made where it is more likely than not that this exposure will materialize. Canadian income taxes are not provided for on the unremitted earnings of foreign investments that the Company does not intend to repatriate in the foreseeable future. Any interest and/or penalty incurred related to income tax is reflected in Income tax expense. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company recognizes the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations (ARO) in the period in which it is incurred, when a legal obligation exists and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and the liability is accreted through charges to Plant operating costs and other in the Consolidated statement of income. In determining the fair value of ARO, the following assumptions are used: • the expected retirement date • the scope and cost of abandonment and reclamation activities that are required • appropriate inflation and discount rates. The Company's AROs are substantially related to its power generation facilities. The scope and timing of asset retirements related to the Company's natural gas pipelines and storage facilities are indeterminable because the Company intends to operate them as long as there is supply and demand. As a result, the Company has not recorded an amount for ARO related to these assets. Environmental Liabilities and Emission Allowances and Credits The Company records liabilities on an undiscounted basis for environmental remediation efforts that are likely to occur and where the cost can be reasonably estimated. These estimates, including associated legal costs, are based on available information using existing technology and enacted laws and regulations and are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs incurred or new circumstances. TC Energy evaluates recoveries from insurers and other third parties separately from the liability and, when recovery is probable, an asset is recorded separately from the associated liability. These recoveries are presented, along with environmental remediation costs, on a net basis in Plant operating costs and other in the Consolidated statement of income. Variations in one or more of the categories described above could result in additional costs such as fines, penalties and/or expenditures associated with litigation and settlement of claims with respect to environmental liabilities. Emission allowances or credits purchased for compliance are recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet at historical cost and derecognized when they are utilized or cancelled/retired by government agencies. Compliance costs are expensed when incurred. Allowances granted to or internally generated by TC Energy are not attributed a value for accounting purposes. When required, TC Energy accrues emission liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet using the best estimate of the amount required to settle the compliance obligation. Allowances and credits not used for compliance are sold and any gain or loss is recorded in Revenues within the Power and Energy Solutions segment in the Consolidated statement of income. The Company records allowances and credits held for compliance in Other current assets and Other long-term assets on the Consolidated balance sheet. Allowances and credits not held for compliance are classified as Inventories on the Consolidated balance sheet. 156 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Page 159
Stock Options and Other Compensation Programs TC Energy's Stock Option Plan permits options for the purchase of common shares to be awarded to certain employees, including officers. Stock options granted are recorded using the fair value method. Under this method, compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value as calculated using a binomial model and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with an offset to Additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. Upon exercise of stock options, amounts originally recorded against Additional paid-in capital are reclassified to Common shares on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Company has medium-term incentive plans under which payments are made to eligible employees. The expense related to these incentive plans is accounted for on an accrual basis. Under these plans, benefits vest when certain conditions are met, including the employees' continued employment during a specified period and achievement of specified corporate performance targets. Employee Post-Retirement Benefits The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans (DB Plans), defined contribution plans (DC Plans), savings plans and other post-retirement benefit plans (OPEB Plans). Contributions made by the Company to the DC Plans and savings plans are expensed in the period in which contributions are made. The cost of the DB Plans and OPEB Plans received by employees is actuarially determined using the projected benefit method pro-rated based on service and management's best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation, retirement age of employees and expected health care costs. The DB Plans' assets are measured at fair value at December 31 of each year. The expected return on the DB Plans' assets is determined using market-related values based on a five-year moving average value for all of the DB Plans' assets. Past service costs are amortized over the expected average remaining service life (EARSL) of the employees. Adjustments arising from plan amendments are amortized on a straight-line basis over the EARSL of employees active at the date of amendment. The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its DB Plans as an asset or liability, respectively, on its Consolidated balance sheet and recognizes changes in that funded status through Other comprehensive income (loss)(OCI) in the year in which the change occurs. The excess of net actuarial gains or losses over 10 per cent of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related value of the DB Plans' assets, if any, is amortized out of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)(AOCI) and into net income over the EARSL of the active employees. When the restructuring of a benefit plan gives rise to both a curtailment and a settlement, the curtailment is accounted for prior to the settlement. For certain regulated operations, post-retirement benefit amounts are recoverable through tolls as benefits are funded. The Company records any unrecognized gains or losses or changes in actuarial assumptions related to these post-retirement benefit plans as either regulatory assets or liabilities. The regulatory assets or liabilities are amortized on a straight-line basis over the EARSL of active employees. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation Foreign currency transactions are those transactions whose terms are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company or reporting subsidiary operates. This is referred to as the functional currency. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date whereas non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historical rate of exchange in effect on the date of the transaction. Exchange gains and losses resulting from translation of monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in net income except for exchange gains and losses on any foreign currency debt related to Canadian regulated natural gas pipelines, which are deferred until they are refunded or recovered in tolls, as permitted by the CER. Gains and losses arising from translation of foreign operations' functional currencies to the Company's Canadian dollar reporting currency are reflected in OCI until the operations are sold, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to net income. Asset and liability accounts are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date while revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. The Company's U.S. dollar-denominated debt and certain derivative hedging instruments have been designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries and, as a result, the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on the U.S. dollar-denominated debt and derivatives are also reflected in OCI. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 157

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value, unless they qualify for and are designated under a normal purchase and normal sales exemption, or are considered to meet other permitted exemptions. The Company applies hedge accounting to arrangements that qualify for and are designated for hedge accounting treatment. This includes fair value and cash flow hedges as well as hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging relationship ceases to be effective or the hedging or hedged items cease to exist as a result of maturity, expiry, sale, termination, cancellation or exercise. In a fair value hedging relationship, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk and these changes are recognized in net income. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging item, which are also recorded in net income. Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange and interest rate fair value hedges are recorded in Interest income and other and Interest expense, respectively. If hedge accounting is discontinued, the carrying value of the hedged item is no longer adjusted and the cumulative fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are amortized to net income over the remaining term of the original hedging relationship. In a cash flow hedging relationship, the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in OCI. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the amounts recognized previously in AOCI are reclassified to Revenues, Interest expense and Interest income and other, as appropriate, during the periods when the variability in cash flows of the hedged item affects net income or as the original hedged item settles. Gains and losses on derivatives are reclassified immediately to net income from AOCI when the hedged item is sold or terminated early, or when it becomes probable that the anticipated transaction will not occur. Termination payments on interest rate derivatives are classified as a financing activity in the Consolidated statement of cash flows. In hedging the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments are recognized in OCI. The amounts recognized previously in AOCI are reclassified to net income in the event the Company reduces its net investment in a foreign operation. In some cases, derivatives do not meet the specific criteria for hedge accounting treatment. In these instances, the changes in fair value are recorded in net income in the period of change. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as part of RRA, including those that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, are refunded or recovered through the tolls charged by the Company. As a result, these gains and losses are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets and are refunded to or collected from rate payers in subsequent periods when the derivative settles. Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or contracts (host instrument) are recorded as separate derivatives. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value if their economic characteristics are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument, their terms are the same as those of a stand-alone derivative and the total contract is not held for trading or accounted for at fair value. When changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives are measured separately, they are included in net income. Long-Term Debt Transaction Costs and Issuance Costs The Company records long-term debt transaction costs and issuance costs as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability and amortizes these costs using the effective interest method except those related to the Canadian natural gas regulated pipelines, which continue to be amortized on a straight-line basis in accordance with the provisions of regulatory tolling mechanisms. Guarantees Upon issuance, the Company records the fair value of certain guarantees entered into by the Company on behalf of a partially-owned entity or by partially-owned entities for which contingent payments may be made. The fair value of these guarantees is estimated by discounting the cash flows that would be incurred by the Company if letters of credit were used in place of the guarantees as appropriate in the circumstances. Guarantees are recorded as an increase to Equity investments or Plant, property and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded in Other long-term liabilities. The release from the obligation is recognized either over the term of the guarantee or upon expiration or settlement of the guarantee. 158 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Variable Interest Entities A VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. The assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, is completed at the inception of the entity or at a reconsideration event. Consolidated VIEs The Company's consolidated VIEs consist of legal entities where the Company has a variable interest and for which it is considered the primary beneficiary. As the primary beneficiary, the Company has the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact economic performance including: purchasing or selling significant assets; maintenance and operations of assets; incurring additional indebtedness; or determining the strategic operating direction of the entity. In addition, the Company has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the consolidated VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Non-Consolidated VIEs The Company’s non-consolidated VIEs consist of legal entities where the Company has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power (either explicit or implicit), through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs or where this power is shared with third parties. The Company contributes capital to these VIEs and receives ownership interests that provide it with residual claims on assets after liabilities are paid. Non-consolidated VIEs are accounted for as equity investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss is the maximum loss that could potentially be recorded through net income in future periods as a result of the Company’s variable interest in a VIE.

3. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Changes in Accounting Policies for 2024 Segment Reporting In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance to improve disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. The guidance was effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2024. Refer to Note 5, Segmented information. Leases In March 2023, the FASB issued new guidance that clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements associated with common control leases. This new guidance was effective January 1, 2024 and adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Future Accounting Changes Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued new guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures through improvements to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The guidance also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025. The guidance is applied prospectively with retrospective application permitted. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements not yet issued. The Company intends to adopt the guidance prospectively and does not intend to early adopt the guidance. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses In November 2024, the FASB issued new guidance requiring additional disclosure on the nature of expenses included in the income statement. The new standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2027 and interim periods beginning January 1, 2028. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is applied prospectively with retrospective application permitted. The Company intends to adopt the guidance prospectively and does not intend to early adopt the guidance. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 160 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Spinoff of Liquids Pipelines Business Agreements Pursuant to the October 1, 2024 Spinoff Transaction described in Note 1, Description of TC Energy's business, TC Energy and South Bow have executed a series of agreements to outline the parameters and guidelines that govern their ongoing relationship. A Transition Services Agreement has been established to specify certain services that TC Energy will provide to South Bow for a period of up to two years. These services primarily include access to, and support of, systems that South Bow will continue to use until it has fully implemented new systems to support its business processes and warehouse management services. A Tax Matters Agreement was executed to govern TC Energy and South Bow's tax rights and obligations after the Spinoff Transaction. The agreement imposes certain restrictions on both TC Energy and South Bow in order to preserve the tax-free status of the spinoff. In the event the Spinoff Transaction is not tax-free, the agreement allocates tax liabilities by generally assigning responsibility to either TC Energy or South Bow to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions, or a breach of the representations or covenants made by that entity. A Separation Agreement was established to specify the separation of assets and liabilities between TC Energy and South Bow. The agreement states, among other things, that TC Energy will indemnify South Bow for 86 per cent of total net liabilities and costs arising from the Milepost 14 incident that occurred on the Keystone Pipeline System in December 2022 and the existing variable toll disputes on the Keystone Pipeline System (excluding any future impacts with respect to the variable toll after October 1, 2024), subject to a maximum liability to South Bow of $30 million, in aggregate, for those two matters. At December 31, 2023, the Company accrued a life-to-date environmental liability for the Milepost 14 incident of $794 million, before expected insurance recoveries and not including potential fines and penalties which were indeterminable. Prior to the Spinoff Transaction, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounts paid for the environmental remediation liability were $92 million (twelve months ended December 31, 2023 – $676 million). For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company received $99 million (2023 – $575 million) from its insurance policies related to the costs for environmental remediation. In addition, the Company also received insurance proceeds of $36 million that were collected from the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. As part of the Separation Agreement, all future insurance recoveries will remain with TC Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a pre-tax expense of $37 million for its current estimate of potential incremental costs related to the Milepost 14 incident. This amount represents TC Energy’s 86 per cent share pursuant to the indemnity provisions in the Separation Agreement. Amounts accrued for these matters are recorded as current assets and liabilities from discontinued operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the final amounts to be settled under these indemnities, any amounts that may ultimately be payable in respect of these net liabilities to South Bow could differ materially from those reported at December 31, 2024. Separation Costs Liquids Pipelines business separation costs primarily include internal costs related to separation activities, legal, income tax, audit and other consulting fees, insurance provisions and net financial charges related to debt issued and held in escrow. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Liquids Pipelines business separation costs of $197 million ($167 million after tax) and $40 million ($34 million after tax), respectively, were included in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated statement of income.

Pensions As part of the Spinoff Transaction, certain TC Energy employees became employees of South Bow. Prior to the Spinoff Transaction, these employees in Canada and the U.S. participated in DB Plans, DC Plans and savings plans, as applicable. Effective October 1, 2024, the benefit obligations under the DB Plans in respect of the employees moving from TC Energy to South Bow were transferred to South Bow. An asset transfer application related to the Canadian DB Plan will be prepared in early 2025 outlining the proposed transfer of assets from TC Energy to South Bow. The Canadian DB Plan's assets to be transferred to South Bow are subject to regulatory approval and will be transferred when approval is received. As at December 31, 2024, these assets remain in the TC Energy DB Plan trust and have been reflected as Long-term assets of discontinued operations and a corresponding obligation to South Bow has been reflected as Long-term liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated balance sheet. The assets related to the U.S. DB Plan were fully transferred to South Bow as at December 31, 2024. South Bow Debt On August 28, 2024, South Bow Canadian Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. and 6297782 LLC, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company at the time, completed an offering of approximately $7.9 billion Canadian-dollar equivalent of senior unsecured notes and junior subordinated notes. Approximately $6.2 billion Canadian-dollar equivalent of the net proceeds was placed in escrow pending the completion of the Spinoff Transaction on October 1, 2024 and US$1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes were used to repay a TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL) term loan. Upon completion of the Spinoff Transaction, the escrowed funds were released to South Bow and used to repay indebtedness owed by South Bow and its subsidiaries to TC Energy and its subsidiaries. Presentation of Discontinued Operations Upon completion of the Spinoff Transaction, the Liquids Pipelines business was accounted for as discontinued operations. The Company's presentation of discontinued operations includes revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Liquids Pipelines business. As such, the results of discontinued operations excludes shared costs related to TC Energy’s corporate services and governance functions that had provided support, and whose costs had been historically allocated, to the Liquids Pipelines segment. Depreciation expense related to Corporate shared assets has also been excluded from the results of discontinued operations. The Company has elected to allocate a portion of interest expense incurred at the corporate level to discontinued operations. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to present the Liquids Pipelines business as discontinued operations.

Contract assets and long-term contract assets primarily relate to the Company’s right to revenues for services completed but not invoiced at the reporting date on long-term committed capacity natural gas pipelines contracts. The change in contract assets is primarily related to the transfer to Accounts receivable when these rights become unconditional and the customer is invoiced, as well as the recognition of additional revenues that remain to be invoiced. Contract liabilities and long-term contract liabilities primarily represent unearned revenue for contracted services. Under the terms of the consolidated Transportation Service Agreement (TSA), the contract liability relating to current and future in-service pipelines of the Company's Mexico-based subsidiary, Transportadora de Gas Natural de la Huasteca (TGNH), is netted against certain contract asset balances. The resulting net contract liability is settled against Net investment in leases on the Consolidated balance sheet when the pipeline enters into service.

Future Revenues from Remaining Performance Obligations As at December 31, 2024, future revenues from long-term pipeline capacity arrangements and transportation as well as natural gas storage and other contracts extending through 2055 are approximately $29.1 billion, of which approximately $6.4 billion is expected to be recognized in 2025. A significant portion of the Company's revenues are not included in the future revenue disclosure above, as the Company has elected the following disclosure exemptions: • revenues related to flow-through operating costs, or other similar variable consideration, that are recognized at the amount for which the Company has the right to invoice the customer • variable consideration relating to interruptible transportation service revenues and power generation revenues where there is uncertainty in estimating the amount of future revenue • revenues for periods extending beyond the current rate settlement term for the Company’s U.S. natural gas pipelines' regulated transportation and storage contracts where the maximum tariff rate is to be collected from shippers • revenues for periods extending beyond the current rate settlement term for the Company's Canadian natural gas pipelines' regulated firm capacity contracts. 7. COASTAL GASLINK On November 18, 2024, Coastal GasLink Pipeline Limited Partnership (Coastal GasLink LP) executed a commercial agreement with LNG Canada (LNGC) and each of the five LNGC participants (LNGC Participants) that declared commercial in-service for the pipeline, allowing for the collection of tolls from customers retroactive to October 1, 2024. The agreement also includes a one-time payment of $199 million from LNGC Participants to TC Energy in recognition of the completion of certain work and the final settlement of costs. The payment is to be made by LNGC Participants upon the earlier of three months after the declared in-service of the LNGC facility, or December 15, 2025. The payment, which accrues in full to TC Energy in accordance with the contractual terms between the Coastal GasLink LP partners, has been accounted for as an in-substance equity distribution from Coastal GasLink LP and reflected in Accounts receivable and Equity investments on the Company's Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024. Subordinated Loan Agreement TC Energy has a subordinated loan agreement with Coastal GasLink LP under which the Company advances non-revolving interest-bearing loans subject to floating market-based rates to Coastal GasLink LP to fund capital costs to complete the Coastal GasLink pipeline. At December 31, 2023, this loan had a committed capacity of $3,375 million. Coastal GasLink LP partners, including TC Energy, were contractually obligated to contribute equity to Coastal GasLink LP to ultimately fund the settlement of amounts outstanding under the subordinated loan agreement. Because of the expectation that the Company would predominantly fund the settlement of the amounts outstanding, amounts drawn under the subordinated loan agreement have been accounted for as in-substance equity contributions and are presented as Contributions to equity investments in the Company’s Consolidated statement of cash flows. Repayments of amounts owed by Coastal GasLink LP to the Company are accounted for as in-substance equity distributions and are presented in Other distributions from equity investments in the Company's Consolidated statement of cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2024, draws of $627 million (2023 - $2,520 million) were made by Coastal GasLink LP under the subordinated loan agreement. On December 17, 2024, following the declared commercial in-service of the pipeline, Coastal GasLink LP repaid the $3,147 million balance owing to TC Energy under the subordinated loan agreement. The Company's share of equity contributions required to fund Coastal GasLink LP's repayment of the outstanding loan balance amounted to $3,137 million. This repayment reduced the Company's funding commitment under the subordinated loan agreement to $228 million at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, $228 million (December 31, 2023 - $855 million) in unused committed capacity remains available for use by Coastal GasLink LP. At December 31, 2024, the balance of loans outstanding under the subordinated loan agreement was nil (December 31, 2023 - $2,520 million). 170 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Subordinated Demand Revolving Credit Facility Agreement The Company has a subordinated demand revolving credit facility agreement with Coastal GasLink LP to provide additional short-term liquidity and funding flexibility to projects under construction. Facilities available through this agreement bear interest at floating market-based rates and have a combined capacity of $120 million (December 31, 2023 - $100 million) with no outstanding balances at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Impairment of Equity Investment in Coastal GasLink LP In February 2023, Coastal GasLink LP announced an increase in the revised capital cost of the Coastal GasLink pipeline. As noted above, the expectation was that equity contributions to fund the increased capital cost would be predominantly funded by TC Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2022 until the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the expectation that additional equity contributions under the subordinated loan agreement would be predominantly funded by TC Energy was an indication of significant adverse impact on the estimated fair value of the Company’s investment in Coastal GasLink LP. The Company completed valuation assessments in each of these periods and concluded that the fair value of its investment in Coastal GasLink LP was below its carrying value in each period assessed, reflecting other-than-temporary impairments. As a result, the Company recorded cumulative pre-tax impairment charges of $5,148 million, or $4,586 million after tax, between December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. No further indication of other-than-temporary impairments of the Company's investment in Coastal GasLink LP have since been identified and no further impairment charges have been recorded. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Coastal GasLink LP was $1,006 million (2023 – $294 million). 8.

Sales-Type Leases The Tamazunchale, Villa de Reyes and Tula pipelines are part of a U.S. dollar-denominated take-or-pay TSA that extends through 2055 between TGNH and the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE). The consolidated TSA contains a lease with multiple lease and non-lease components. The lease components within the TSA represent the capacity available to the CFE provided by the in-service pipelines within TGNH at December 31, 2024. The non-lease components represent the Company’s services with respect to operation and maintenance of the TGNH pipelines in service. The Company allocated a portion of the contract consideration to non-lease components for the provision of operating and maintenance services based on the stand-alone selling price using an expected cost plus margin approach. The remaining consideration was allocated to the lease components using the residual approach due to uncertainty surrounding the stand-alone selling price. During 2024, the Company did not enter into any new sales-type lease arrangements (2023 – $407 million). Future lease payments to be received under the existing sales-type leases are as follows: at December 31 (millions of Canadian $) 2024 2023 Less than one year 333 305 One to two years 333 305 Two to three years 333 305 Three to four years 333 305 Four to five years 333 305 More than five years 8,499 8,102 10,164 9,627 The following table lists the components of the aggregate net investment in leases reflected on the Company's Consolidated balance sheet: at December 31 (millions of Canadian $) 2024 2023 Net Investment in Leases Minimum lease payments 10,164 9,627 Unearned lease income (7,323) (7,006) Lease receivable 2,841 2,621 Expected credit loss provision 1 (59) (76) Present value of unguaranteed residual value 28 24 2,810 2,569 Current portion included in Other current assets (Note 8) (333) (306) 2,477 2,263 1 Includes $6 million (2023 – nil) of foreign currency translation losses.

Refer to Note 7, Coastal GasLink, for additional information. 12. LOANS RECEIVABLE FROM AFFILIATES Related party transactions are conducted in the normal course of business and are measured at the exchange amount, which is the amount of consideration established and agreed to by the related parties. Coastal GasLink Pipeline Limited Partnership TC Energy holds a 35 per cent equity interest in Coastal GasLink LP and has been contracted to develop, construct and operate the Coastal GasLink pipeline. The Company has a subordinated loan agreement and a subordinated demand revolving credit facility with Coastal GasLink LP. Refer to Note 7, Coastal GasLink, for additional information. Sur de Texas TC Energy holds a 60 per cent equity interest in a joint venture with IEnova to own the Sur de Texas pipeline, for which TC Energy is the operator. In 2017, TC Energy entered into a MXN$21.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the joint venture, which bore interest at a floating rate and was fully repaid upon maturity on March 15, 2022 in the amount of $1.2 billion. The Company's Consolidated statement of income reflects the related interest income and foreign exchange impact on this loan receivable until its repayment on March 15, 2022, which were fully offset upon consolidation with corresponding amounts included in TC Energy’s proportionate share of Sur de Texas equity earnings as follows: year ended December 31 Affected line item in the Consolidated statement of income (millions of Canadian $) 2024 2023 2022 Interest income 1 — — 19 Interest income and other Interest expense 2 — — (19) Income (loss) from equity investments Foreign exchange losses 1 — — (28) Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net Foreign exchange gains 1 — — 28 Income (loss) from equity investments 1 Included in the Corporate segment. 2 Included in the Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines segment. 178 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

On March 15, 2022, as part of refinancing activities with the Sur de Texas joint venture, the peso-denominated inter-affiliate loan discussed above was replaced with a new U.S. dollar-denominated inter-affiliate loan from TC Energy of an equivalent $1.2 billion (US$938 million) with a floating interest rate. On July 29, 2022, the Sur de Texas joint venture entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with third parties, the proceeds of which were used to fully repay the U.S. dollar-denominated inter-affiliate loan with TC Energy. 13. RATE-REGULATED BUSINESSES TC Energy's businesses that apply RRA currently include almost all of the Canadian, U.S. and Mexico natural gas pipelines and certain U.S. natural gas storage operations. Rate-regulated businesses account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the resulting economic impact of the regulators' established rates, provided the rates are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain revenues and expenses subject to utility regulation or rate determination that would otherwise be reflected in the statement of income are deferred on the balance sheet and are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers in future service rates. Canadian Regulated Operations The majority of TC Energy's Canadian natural gas pipelines are regulated by the CER under the Canadian Energy Regulator Act. The CER regulates the construction and operation of facilities and the terms and conditions of services, including rates, for the Company's Canadian regulated natural gas transmission systems under federal jurisdiction. The Impact Assessment Agency of Canada continues to assess designated projects. TC Energy's Canadian natural gas transmission services are supplied under natural gas transportation tariffs that provide for cost recovery, including return of and on capital as approved by the CER. Rates charged for these services are typically set through a process that involves filing an application with the regulator wherein forecasted operating costs, including a return of and on capital, determine the revenue requirement for the upcoming year or multiple years. To the extent actual costs and revenues are more or less than forecasted costs and revenues, the regulator generally allows the difference to be deferred to a future period and recovered or refunded in rates at that time. Differences between actual and forecasted costs that the regulator does not allow to be deferred are included in the determination of net income in the year they occur. The Company's most significant regulated Canadian natural gas pipelines, based on total operated pipe length, are described below. NGTL System Prior to December 31, 2024, the NGTL System operated under the 2020-2024 Revenue Requirement Settlement (the 2020-2024 Settlement). The 2020-2024 Settlement included an approved ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity, provided the NGTL System the opportunity to increase depreciation rates if tolls fell below specified levels and provided an incentive mechanism for certain operating costs where variances from projected amounts are shared with its customers. In September 2024, the CER approved a new five-year negotiated revenue requirement settlement (the 2025–2029 NGTL Settlement) which commenced on January 1, 2025. The settlement enables an investment framework that supports the approval by the Company's Board of Directors (Board) to allocate approximately $3.3 billion of capital towards progression of a new multi- year growth plan for expansion facilities on the NGTL System. It is comprised of multiple distinct projects with targeted in-service dates between 2027 and 2030 that are subject to final Company and regulatory approvals. The 2025-2029 NGTL Settlement maintains an ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity while increasing NGTL System depreciation rates, with an incentive that allows the NGTL System the opportunity to further increase depreciation rates if tolls fall below specified levels or if growth projects are undertaken. The 2025-2029 NGTL Settlement introduces a new incentive mechanism to reduce both physical emissions and emission compliance costs, which builds on the incentive mechanism for certain operating costs where variances from projected amounts and emissions savings are shared with customers. A provision for review exists in the current settlement if tolls exceed a pre-determined level or if final Company approvals of the multi-year growth plan are not obtained.

Canadian Mainline The Canadian Mainline currently operates under the terms of the 2015-2030 Tolls Application approved in 2014 (the 2014 Decision). In April 2020, the CER approved the six-year unanimous negotiated settlement (the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement) effective January 1, 2021. Similar to the previous settlement, the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement maintains a base equity return of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity and includes an incentive to either achieve cost efficiencies and/or increase revenues on the pipeline with a beneficial sharing mechanism to both customers and TC Energy. Toll stabilization is achieved using deferral accounts, including the toll-stabilization account and the short-term adjustment accounts (STAA), which capture the surplus or shortfall between system revenues and cost of service each year under the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement. A portion of the STAA commenced amortization in 2023 and the remainder commenced amortization in 2024, according to the terms outlined in the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement as predetermined thresholds per the settlement agreement were met. Similar to the STAA, the long-term adjustment account (LTAA) and bridging account were used to capture the surplus or shortfall between the Company's revenues and cost of service during the previous settlement and are amortized over the life of 2021-2026 Settlement and the 2014 Decision respectively. U.S. Regulated Operations TC Energy's U.S. regulated natural gas pipelines operate under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and are subject to the jurisdiction of FERC. The NGA grants FERC authority over the construction, acquisition and operation of pipelines and related facilities, including the regulation of tariffs which incorporates maximum and minimum rates for services and allows U.S. regulated natural gas pipelines to discount or negotiate rates on a non-discriminatory basis. The Company's most significant regulated U.S. natural gas pipelines, based on effective ownership and total operated pipe length, are described below. Columbia Gas Columbia Gas' natural gas transportation and storage services are provided under a tariff at rates subject to FERC approval. Columbia Gas operates under a settlement approved by FERC in February 2022 (the 2022 Columbia Gas Settlement). As part of the settlement, there is a moratorium on any further rate changes until April 1, 2025, and Columbia Gas must file for new rates with an effective date no later than April 1, 2026. Additionally, Columbia Gas maintains a FERC-approved modernization program allowing for the cost recovery and return on additional investment up to US$1.2 billion over a four-year period through 2024 to modernize the Columbia Gas system, thereby improving system integrity and enhancing service reliability and flexibility. In September 2024, Columbia Gas filed a general NGA Section 4 rate case with FERC requesting an increase to Columbia Gas’ maximum transportation rates effective April 1, 2025, subject to refund based on the outcome of the proceeding. ANR Pipeline ANR Pipeline operates under rates established through a 2022 FERC-approved rate settlement (the 2022 ANR Settlement). The 2022 ANR Settlement reflects the agreement of ANR Pipeline, its customers and FERC staff to resolve all outstanding issues pertaining to the original rate case filing in January 2022 and was effective August 2022. The 2022 ANR Settlement received FERC approval on April 11, 2023. As part of the settlement, there is a moratorium on any further rate changes until November 1, 2025. ANR must file for new rates with an effective date no later than August 1, 2028. The settlement also included an additional rate step up effective August 2024 related to certain modernization projects. In 2023, previously accrued rate refund liabilities, including interest, were refunded to customers. Columbia Gulf Columbia Gulf operates under a settlement approved by FERC in August 2023, effective March 1, 2024 (the 2023 Columbia Gulf Settlement). The 2023 Columbia Gulf Settlement includes a moratorium on further rate changes through February 28, 2027, and Columbia Gulf must file for new rates no later than March 1, 2029. Great Lakes Great Lakes operates under a rate settlement approved by FERC on April 26, 2022 (the 2022 Great Lakes Settlement), which maintains Great Lakes’ existing maximum transportation rates through October 31, 2025. The 2022 Great Lakes Settlement contains a moratorium until October 31, 2025. Great Lakes will be required to file for new rates no later than April 30, 2025, with such new rates effective no later than November 1, 2025. 180 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Tuscarora Tuscarora operates under rates established as part of the FERC-approved rate settlement on September 6, 2023 (the 2023 Tuscarora Settlement). The 2023 Tuscarora Settlement provided for phased rate reductions as of February 1, 2023, and additionally as of February 1, 2025. The 2023 Tuscarora Settlement contains a moratorium that expires December 1, 2028. Tuscarora is required to file new rates by December 1, 2028. Gas Transmission Northwest On September 29, 2023, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) filed a general NGA Section 4 Rate Case with FERC, requesting an increase to GTN's maximum rates to become effective April 1, 2024, and subject to refund. On August 9, 2024, GTN filed a settlement with FERC resolving all issues in the general NGA Section 4 Rate Case. On October 21, 2024, the settlement was approved by FERC. Mexico Regulated Operations TC Energy's Mexico natural gas pipelines are regulated by CRE and operate in accordance with CRE-approved tariffs. The rates in effect on TC Energy's Mexico natural gas pipelines provide for cost recovery, including a return of and on invested capital. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 181

Accordingly, these regulatory assets or liabilities are not included in rate base and do not yield a return on investment during the recovery period. 2 Operating and debt-service regulatory assets and liabilities represent the accumulation of cost and revenue variances to be included in determination of rates in the following year. 3 These balances represent the regulatory offset to pension plan and other post-retirement benefit obligations to the extent the amounts are expected to be collected from or refunded to customers in future rates. 4 Foreign exchange on long-term debt of the NGTL System represents the variance resulting from revaluing foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to the current foreign exchange rate from the historical foreign exchange rate at the time of issue. Foreign exchange gains and losses realized when foreign debt matures or is redeemed early are expected to be recovered or refunded through the determination of future tolls. 5 This balance represents the amounts collected in tolls from customers and included in the LMCI restricted investments to fund future abandonment of the Company's CER-regulated pipeline facilities. 6 The U.S. corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35 per cent to 21 per cent in 2017 as a result of H.R.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform). This U.S. regulated operations balance, where applicable, represents established regulatory liabilities driven by 2018 FERC prescribed changes related to U.S. Tax Reform being amortized over varying terms that approximate the expected reversal of the underlying deferred tax liabilities that gave rise to the regulatory liabilities. 7 These regulatory accounts are used to capture revenue and cost variances plus toll-stabilization adjustments during the 2015-2030 settlement term. 8 Under the terms of the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement, a portion of the STAA account commenced amortization in 2023 and the remainder commenced amortization in 2024, as predetermined thresholds were met, over the terms outlined per the settlement agreement. 9 This balance represents anticipated costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of certain rate-regulated operations for future costs to be incurred. 10 Under the terms of the 2021-2026 Mainline Settlement, $223 million is amortized over the six-year settlement term. 11 This balance represents the amount ANR estimates it would be required to refund to its customers for post-retirement and post-employment benefit amounts collected through its FERC-approved rates that have not been used to pay benefits to its employees. Pursuant to a FERC-approved rate settlement, the $45 million (US$32 million) balance at December 31, 2024 is subject to resolution through future regulatory proceedings and, accordingly, a settlement period cannot be determined at this time. 182 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

14. GOODWILL The Company's Goodwill balance on the Consolidated balance sheet is comprised of the following amounts: at December 31 2024 2023 (millions) Canadian dollars U.S. dollars Canadian dollars U.S. dollars Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 10,588 7,351 9,708 7,351 ANR 2,803 1,946 2,570 1,946 Great Lakes 176 122 161 122 North Baja 70 48 63 48 Tuscarora 33 23 30 23 13,670 9,490 12,532 9,490 Changes in Goodwill were as follows: (millions of Canadian $) U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines Balance at January 1, 2023 12,843 Foreign exchange rate changes (311) Balance at December 31, 2023 1 12,532 Foreign exchange rate changes 1,138 Balance at December 31, 2024 1 13,670 1 Represents gross amounts of goodwill as at December 31, 2024 of $15,405 million (2023 – $14,267 million), net of accumulated impairment of $1,735 million (2023 – $1,735 million). As part of the annual goodwill impairment assessment at December 31, 2024, the Company evaluated qualitative factors impacting the fair value of the underlying reporting units. It was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. Columbia On October 4, 2023, as part of the asset divestiture program announced in 2022, the Company successfully completed the sale of a 40 per cent non-controlling equity interest in Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf. In conjunction with the process leading up to the sale, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test at June 30, 2023. The estimated fair value measurements used in the Company's goodwill impairment analysis are classified as Level III of the fair value hierarchy. In the determination of the fair value utilized in the quantitative goodwill impairment test for the Columbia reporting unit, the Company performed a discounted cash flow model analysis using projections of future cash flows and applied a risk-adjusted discount rate and value multiple which involved significant estimates and judgments. It was determined that the fair value of the Columbia reporting unit, inclusive of the Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf business units, exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. Although goodwill was not impaired, the estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value was less than 10 per cent. There is a risk that reductions in future cash flow forecasts and adverse changes in other key assumptions could result in a future impairment of a portion of the goodwill balance relating to Columbia. Great Lakes In March 2022, an impairment loss of $571 million ($531 million after tax) was recognized for the excess carrying value over the estimated fair value of our Great Lakes reporting unit. There is a risk that reductions in future cash flow forecasts and adverse changes in other key assumptions could result in future impairment of the remaining goodwill balance.

The increase in the valuation allowance is primarily a result of the foreign exchange movement on unrecognized capital losses. At December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a total of $358 million in valuation allowance as a result of the Coastal GasLink equity investment impairment that resulted in a portion of the impairment having unrealized non-taxable capital losses. These losses have not been recognized as of December 31, 2024. At each reporting date, the Company considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2024, the Company determined there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2024, the Company has recognized the benefit of non-capital loss carryforwards of $6,740 million (2023 – $6,593 million) for federal and provincial purposes in Canada, which expire from 2030 to 2044. The Company has not yet recognized the benefit of capital loss carryforwards of $599 million (2023 – $478 million) for federal and provincial purposes in Canada which have no expiry date. The Company has Ontario corporate minimum tax (CMT) credits of $161 million (2023 – $140 million), which expire from 2026 to 2044. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not recognized the benefit of CMT credits of $22 million (2023 – $22 million). As of December 31, 2024, the Company has recognized the benefit of disallowed Canadian interest expense of $480 million (2023 - nil) which may be carried forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2024, the Company has recognized the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards of US$518 million (2023 – US$47 million) in Mexico, which expire from 2024 to 2034. 188 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Unremitted Earnings of Foreign Investments Income taxes have not been provided on the unremitted earnings of foreign investments that the Company does not intend to repatriate in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax liabilities would have increased at December 31, 2024 by approximately $1,728 million (2023 – $1,443 million) if there had been a provision for these taxes. Income Tax Payments Income tax payments of $387 million, net of refunds, were made in 2024 (2023 – payments, net of refunds, of $791 million; 2022 – payments, net of refunds, of $394 million). Reconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefit Below is the reconciliation of the annual changes in the total unrecognized tax benefit: at December 31 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian $) Unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year 85 91 80 Gross increases – tax positions in prior years 3 9 6 Gross decreases – tax positions in prior years (2) (1) — Gross increases – tax positions in current year 5 16 7 Gross decrease – tax positions in current year (2) — — Settlement (13) — — Lapse of statutes of limitations (4) (30) (2) Unrecognized Tax Benefit at End of Year 72 85 91 TC Energy's practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax uncertainties in Income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 reflects $1 million interest recovery (2023 – $3 million expense; 2022 – $6 million expense). At December 31, 2024, the Company accrued $19 million in interest expense (2023 – $20 million; 2022 – $18 million). The Company incurred no penalties associated with income tax uncertainties related to income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and no penalties were accrued as at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Subject to the results of audit examinations by taxing authorities and other legislative amendments, TC Energy does not anticipate further adjustments to the unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that would have a material impact on its financial statements. TC Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to either Canadian federal and provincial income tax, U.S. federal, state and local income tax or the relevant income tax in other international jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all Canadian federal and provincial income tax matters for the years through 2016. Substantially all material U.S. federal, state and local income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2016. Substantially all material Mexico income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2018. Mexico Tax Audit In 2019, the Mexican tax authority, the Tax Administration Services (SAT), completed an audit of the 2013 tax return of one of the Company’s subsidiaries in Mexico. The audit resulted in a tax assessment that denied the deduction for all interest expense and an assessment of additional tax, penalties and financial charges totaling less than US$1 million. The Company disagreed with this assessment and commenced litigation to challenge it. In January 2022, TC Energy received the tax court’s ruling on the 2013 tax return, which upheld the SAT assessment. From September 2021 to February 2022, the SAT issued assessments for tax years 2014 through 2017 which denied the deduction of all interest expense as well as assessed incremental withholding tax on the interest. These assessments totaled approximately US$490 million in income and withholding taxes, interest, penalties and other financial charges. During 2022, TC Energy settled with the SAT on all of the above matters for the tax years 2013 through 2021 and recorded $196 million (US$153 million) of income tax expense, inclusive of withholding taxes, interest, penalties and other financial charges for the year ended December 31, 2022.

While the obligations of the Trust are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TCPL on a subordinated basis, the Trust is not consolidated in TC Energy's financial statements since TCPL does not have a variable interest in the Trust and the only substantive assets of the Trust are junior subordinated notes of TCPL. 4 The coupon rate is initially a fixed interest rate for the first 10 years and converts to a floating rate thereafter. 5 The coupon rate is initially a fixed interest rate for the first 10 years and resets every five years thereafter. The Junior subordinated notes are subordinated in right of payment to existing and future senior indebtedness or other obligations of TCPL. In March 2022, TransCanada Trust (the Trust) issued US$800 million of Trust Notes – Series 2022-A to investors with a fixed interest rate of 5.60 per cent per annum for the first 10 years and resetting on the 10th anniversary and every five years thereafter. All of the proceeds of the issuance by the Trust were loaned to TCPL for US$800 million of junior subordinated notes of TCPL at an initial fixed rate of 5.85 per cent per annum, including a 0.25 per cent administration charge. The rate on the junior subordinated notes of TCPL will reset every five years commencing March 2032 until March 2052 to the then Five-Year Treasury Rate, as defined in the document governing the subordinated notes, plus 4.236 per cent per annum; from March 2052 until March 2082, the interest rate will reset every five years to the then Five-Year Treasury Rate plus 4.986 per cent per annum. The junior subordinated notes are callable at TCPL's option at any time from December 7, 2031 to March 7, 2032 and on each interest payment and reset date thereafter at 100 per cent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Pursuant to the terms of the notes issued between the Trust and TCPL (the Trust Notes) and related agreements, in certain circumstances: 1) TCPL may issue deferral preferred shares to holders of the Trust Notes in lieu of interest; and 2) TC Energy and TCPL would be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on or redeeming their outstanding preferred shares (or, if none are outstanding, their respective common shares) until all deferral preferred shares are redeemed by TCPL. The Trust Notes may also be automatically exchanged for preferred shares of TCPL upon certain kinds of bankruptcy and insolvency events. All of these preferred shares would rank equally with any other outstanding first preferred shares of TCPL. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 195

Common Shares Issued Under Public Offering On August 10, 2022, TC Energy issued 28,400,000 common shares at a price of $63.50 each for total gross proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan Under the Company's Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (DRP), eligible holders of common and preferred shares of TC Energy can reinvest their dividends and make optional cash payments to obtain additional TC Energy common shares. From August 31, 2022 to July 31, 2023, common shares were issued from treasury at a discount of two per cent to market prices over a specified period. For the periods between January 1, 2021 and August 31, 2022, and after July 31, 2023, common shares purchased with reinvested cash dividends under TC Energy's DRP are acquired on the open market at 100 per cent of the weighted average purchase price. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share Net income (loss) from continuing operations per common share is calculated by dividing Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations is calculated by dividing Net income (loss) from discontinued operations by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The weighted average number of shares for the diluted earnings per share calculation includes options exercisable under TC Energy's Stock Option Plan and, from August 31, 2022 to July 31, 2023, common shares issuable from treasury under the DRP.

The exercise prices of the new TC Energy stock options were adjusted for the change in value of the TC Energy common shares following the Spinoff Transaction. No other stock options were granted in 2024. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 197

Page 200
At December 31, 2024, an additional 3,621,343 common shares were reserved for future issuance from treasury under TC Energy's Stock Option Plan. The contractual life of options granted is seven years. Options may be exercised at a price determined at the time the option is awarded and vest equally on the anniversary date in each of the three years following the award. Forfeiture of stock options results from their expiration and, if not previously vested, upon resignation or termination of the option holder's employment. Commencing in 2024, the Company no longer issues stock options to employees or officers. The Company used a binomial model for determining the fair value of options granted and applied the following weighted average assumptions: year ended December 31 2024 1 2023 2022 Weighted average fair value — $7.88 $8.24 Expected life (years) 2 — 5.1 5.4 Interest rate — 2.9% 1.6% Volatility 3 — 24% 22% Dividend yield — 6.3% 5.5% 1 Commencing in 2024, the Company no longer issues stock options to employees or officers. 2 Expected life is based on historical exercise activity. 3 Volatility is derived based on the average of both the historical and implied volatility of the Company's common shares. The amount expensed for stock options, with a corresponding increase in Additional paid-in capital, was $6 million in 2024 (2023 – $9 million; 2022 – $10 million). At December 31, 2024, unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested stock options were less than $1 million. The cost is expected to be fully recognized over a weighted average period of 0.7 years. The following table summarizes additional stock option information: year ended December 31 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian $, unless otherwise noted) Total intrinsic value of options exercised 17 — 33 Total fair value of options that have vested 99 76 89 Total options vested 1.5 million 1.5 million 1.6 million As at December 31, 2024, the aggregate intrinsic values of the total options exercisable and the total options outstanding were $20 million and $34 million, respectively. Shareholder Rights Plan TC Energy's Shareholder Rights Plan is designed to provide the Board of Directors with sufficient time to explore and develop alternatives for maximizing shareholder value in the event of a takeover offer for the Company and to encourage the fair treatment of shareholders in connection with any such offer. Attached to each common share is one right that, under certain circumstances, entitles certain holders to purchase an additional common share of the Company. 198 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

27. EMPLOYEE POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company sponsors DB Plans for certain employees. Pension benefits provided under the DB Plans are generally based on years of service and highest average earnings over three to five consecutive years of employment. Effective January 1, 2019, there were certain amendments made to the Canadian DB Plan for new members. Subsequent to that date, benefits provided for new members were based on years of service and highest average earnings over five consecutive years of employment. Upon commencement of retirement, pension benefits in the Canadian DB Plan increase annually by a portion of the increase in the Consumer Price Index for employees hired prior to January 1, 2019. On January 1, 2024 the Canadian DB Plans were closed to new entrants. In 2023, TC Energy announced a plan amendment to the Canadian OPEB Plan. This plan will be closed for any eligible active employees that did not retire by December 31, 2024. All active employees who no longer meet the eligibility for the OPEB Plan will be eligible for a new plan that provides an annual health spending account to retirees and their dependents from retirement to age 65. The Company's U.S. DB Plan is closed to non-union new entrants and all non-union hires participate in the DC Plan. Net actuarial gains or losses are amortized out of AOCI over the EARSL of Plan participants, which was approximately nine years at December 31, 2024 (2023 – nine years; 2022 – nine years). The Company also provides its employees with DC Plans and savings plans in Canada, DC Plans in Mexico, DC Plans consisting of a 401(k) Plan in the U.S. and post-employment benefits other than pensions, including termination benefits and life insurance and medical benefits beyond those provided by government-sponsored plans. Net actuarial gains or losses for the plans are amortized out of AOCI over the EARSL of employees, which was approximately 12 years at December 31, 2024 (2023 – 12 years and 2022 – 12 years). In 2024, the Company expensed $71 million (2023 – $64 million and 2022 – $64 million) for the savings and DC Plans. As part of the Spinoff Transaction, certain TC Energy employees became employees of South Bow. Prior to the Spinoff Transaction, these employees in Canada and the U.S. participated in DB Plans, DC Plans and savings plans, as applicable. Effective October 1, 2024, the benefit obligations under the DB Plans in respect of the employees moving from TC Energy to South Bow were transferred to South Bow. An asset transfer application related to the Canadian DB Plan will be prepared in early 2025 outlining the proposed transfer of assets from TC Energy to South Bow. The Canadian DB Plan's assets to be transferred to South Bow are subject to regulatory approval and will be transferred when approval is received. As at December 31, 2024, these assets remain in the TC Energy DB Plan trust and have been reflected as Long-term assets of discontinued operations and a corresponding obligation to South Bow has been reflected as Long-term liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated balance sheet. The assets related to the U.S. DB Plan were fully transferred to South Bow as at December 31, 2024. Total cash contributions by the Company for employee post-retirement benefits were as follows: year ended December 31 2024 2023 2022 (millions of Canadian $) DB Plans — 28 78 Other post-retirement benefit plans 8 9 8 Savings and DC Plans 71 64 64 79 101 150 Current Canadian pension legislation allows for partial funding of solvency requirements over a number of years through letters of credit in lieu of cash contributions, up to certain limits. Total letters of credit provided to the Canadian DB plan at December 31, 2024 was $111 million (2023 – $244 million; 2022 – $322 million). The most recent actuarial valuation of the pension plans for funding purposes was as at January 1, 2024 and the next required valuation is at January 1, 2025.

Additional pension benefit plan assets were as follows: at December 31 Pension Benefit Plans (millions of Canadian $) 2024 2023 TC Energy plan assets at fair value 3,948 3,697 South Bow plan assets held in trust 1 110 — Plan assets at fair value – end of year 4,058 3,697 1 Related to the transfer of pension assets to South Bow. The final transfer will be adjusted for investment returns and benefit payments from October 1, 2024 to the transfer date. The $110 million is reflected in Long-term assets of discontinued operations. The actuarial gain realized on the defined benefit plan obligation is primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average discount rate from 4.75 per cent in 2023 to 4.90 per cent in 2024. The actuarial gain realized on the OPEB Plan obligation is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average discount rate from 5.10 per cent in 2023 to 5.45 per cent in 2024. 204 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Asset mix strategies consider plan demographics and may include traditional equity and debt securities as well as alternative assets such as infrastructure, private equity, real estate and derivatives to diversify risk. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes and may be used to hedge certain liabilities. All investments are measured at fair value using market prices. Where the fair value cannot be readily determined by reference to generally available price quotations, the fair value is determined by considering the discounted cash flows on a risk-adjusted basis and by comparison to similar assets which are publicly traded. In Level I, the fair value of assets is determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. In Level II, the fair value of assets is determined using valuation techniques such as option pricing models and extrapolation using significant inputs which are observable directly or indirectly. In Level III, the fair value of assets is determined using a market approach based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 206 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

This yield curve is used to develop spot rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the spot rate curve to derive a weighted average discount rate. The significant weighted average actuarial assumptions adopted in measuring the Company's benefit obligations were as follows: at December 31 Pension Benefit Plans Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 2024 2023 2024 2023 Discount rate 4.90% 4.75% 5.45% 5.10% Rate of compensation increase 3.05% 3.20% — — The significant weighted average actuarial assumptions adopted in measuring the Company's net benefit plan costs were as follows: year ended December 31 Pension Benefit Plans Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022 Discount rate 4.75% 5.15% 3.05% 5.15% 5.45% 3.10% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.60% 6.45% 6.10% 4.50% 4.50% 3.25% Rate of compensation increase 3.15% 3.25% 3.00% — — — 208 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for the portfolio in aggregate and for each asset class in the portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return are selected after analyzing historical experience and estimating future levels and volatility of returns. Asset class benchmark returns and asset mix are also considered in determining the overall expected rate of return. The discount rate is based on market interest rates of high-quality bonds that match the timing and benefits expected to be paid under each plan. A 6.15 per cent weighted-average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2025 measurement purposes. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.85 per cent by 2032 and remain at this level thereafter. The net benefit cost recognized for the Company’s pension benefit plans and other post-retirement benefit plans was as follows: year ended December 31 Pension Benefit Plans Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (millions of Canadian $) 2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022 Service cost 1 108 93 145 1 3 5 Other components of net benefit cost 1 Interest cost 160 158 125 14 16 13 Expected return on plan assets (248) (234) (239) (14) (16) (14) Amortization of actuarial loss — — 10 — — 1 Amortization of regulatory asset — — 12 (2) — 1 Settlement gain – AOCI — — (2) — — — (88) (76) (94) (2) — 1 Net Benefit Cost Recognized 20 17 51 (1) 3 6 1 Service cost and other components of net benefit cost are included in Plant operating costs and other in the Consolidated statement of income.

28. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risk Management Overview TC Energy has exposure to various financial risks and has strategies, policies and limits in place to manage the impact of these risks on its earnings, cash flows and, ultimately, shareholder value. Risk management strategies, policies and limits are designed to ensure TC Energy's risks and related exposures are in line with the Company's business objectives and risk tolerance. TC Energy's risks are managed within limits that are established by the Company's Board, implemented by senior management and monitored by the Company's risk management, internal audit and business segment groups. The Board's Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with risk management policies and procedures and oversees management's review of the adequacy of the risk management framework. Market Risk The Company constructs and invests in energy infrastructure projects, purchases and sells commodities, issues short- and long‑term debt, including amounts in foreign currencies and invests in foreign operations. Certain of these activities expose the Company to market risk from changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which may affect the Company's earnings, cash flows and the value of its financial assets and liabilities. The Company assesses contracts used to manage market risk to determine whether all, or a portion, meets the definition of a derivative. Derivative contracts the Company uses to assist in managing exposure to market risk may include the following: • forwards and futures contracts – agreements to purchase or sell a specific financial instrument or commodity at a specified price and date in the future • swaps – agreements between two parties to exchange streams of payments over time according to specified terms • options – agreements that convey the right, but not the obligation of the purchaser to buy or sell a specific amount of a financial instrument or commodity at a fixed price, either at a fixed date or at any time within a specified period. Commodity price risk The following strategies may be used to manage the Company's exposure to market risk resulting from commodity price risk management activities in the Company's non-regulated businesses: • in the Company's natural gas marketing business, TC Energy enters into natural gas transportation and storage contracts as well as natural gas purchase and sale agreements. The Company manages exposure on these contracts using financial instruments and hedging activities to offset market price volatility • in the Company's power businesses, TC Energy manages the exposure to fluctuating commodity prices through long-term contracts and hedging activities including selling and purchasing electricity and natural gas in forward markets • in the Company's non-regulated natural gas storage business, TC Energy's exposure to seasonal natural gas price spreads is managed with a portfolio of third-party storage capacity contracts and through offsetting purchases and sales of natural gas in forward markets to lock in future positive margins. Lower natural gas and electricity prices could lead to reduced investment in the development, expansion and production of these commodities. A reduction in the demand for these commodities could negatively impact opportunities to expand the Company's asset base and/or re-contract with TC Energy's shippers and customers as contractual agreements expire. Physical and transition risks The physical and transition risks related to climate change could impact commodity prices and fossil fuel supply and demand dynamics which could affect the Company's financial performance. TC Energy evaluates the financial resilience of its asset portfolio against a range of future pricing and supply and demand outcomes as part of its strategic planning process. TC Energy’s exposure to climate change-related transition risks and resulting policy changes is managed through its business model, which is based on a long-term, low-risk strategy whereby the majority of TC Energy’s earnings are underpinned by regulated cost-of-service arrangements and/or long-term contracts. The Company factors physical and transition risks into capital planning, financial risk management and operational activities and is working towards reducing the GHG emissions intensity of existing operations. 210 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Interest rate risk TC Energy utilizes short- and long-term debt to finance its operations which exposes the Company to interest rate risk. TC Energy typically pays fixed rates of interest on its long-term debt and floating rates on short-term debt including its commercial paper programs and amounts drawn on its credit facilities. A small portion of TC Energy's long-term debt bears interest at floating rates. In addition, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk on financial instruments and contractual obligations containing variable interest rate components. The Company actively manages its interest rate risk using interest rate derivatives. Foreign exchange risk Certain of TC Energy's businesses generate all or most of their earnings in U.S. dollars and, since the Company reports its financial results in Canadian dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar can affect its net income. This exposure grows as the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated operations grow. A portion of this risk is offset by interest expense on U.S. dollar-denominated debt. The balance of the exposure is actively managed on a rolling basis up to three years in advance using foreign exchange derivatives; however, the natural exposure beyond that period remains. A portion of the Company's Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines monetary assets and liabilities are peso-denominated, while TC Energy's Mexico operations' financial results are denominated in U.S. dollars. These peso‑denominated balances are revalued to U.S. dollars and, as a result, changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar can affect the Company's net income. In addition, foreign exchange gains or losses calculated for Mexico income tax purposes on the revaluation of U.S. dollar‑denominated monetary assets and liabilities result in a peso‑denominated income tax exposure for these entities, leading to fluctuations in Income (loss) from equity investments and Income tax expense (recovery). These exposures are actively managed using foreign exchange derivatives, although some unhedged exposure remains. Net investment in foreign operations The Company hedges a portion of its net investment in foreign operations (on an after-tax basis) with U.S. dollar‑denominated debt, cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange options as appropriate. The fair values and notional amounts for the derivatives designated as a net investment hedge were as follows: at December 31 2024 2023 Fair Value 1,2 Notional Amount Fair Value 1,2 Notional Amount (millions of Canadian $, unless otherwise noted) U.S. dollar cross-currency interest rate swaps (maturing 2025) 3 (11) US 100 2 US 200 U.S. dollar foreign exchange options — — 8 US 1,000 (11) US 100 10 US 1,200 1 Fair value equals carrying value. 2 No amounts have been excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 3 In 2024 and 2023, Net income (loss) included net realized gains of less than $1 million related to the interest component of cross-currency swap settlements which are reported within Interest expense. The notional amounts and fair values of U.S. dollar-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge were as follows: at December 31 2024 2023 (millions of Canadian $, unless otherwise noted) Notional amount 26,000 (US 18,000) 27,800 (US 21,100) Fair value 25,700 (US 17,800) 26,600 (US 20,200) TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 211

Counterparty Credit Risk TC Energy's exposure to counterparty credit risk includes its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, available-for-sale assets, the fair value of derivative assets, net investment in leases and certain contract assets in Mexico. At times, the Company's counterparties may endure financial challenges resulting from commodity price and market volatility, economic instability and political or regulatory changes. In addition to actively monitoring these situations, there are a number of factors that reduce TC Energy's counterparty credit risk exposure in the event of default, including: • contractual rights and remedies together with the utilization of contractually-based financial assurances • current regulatory frameworks governing certain TC Energy operations • the competitive position of the Company's assets and the demand for the Company's services • potential recovery of unpaid amounts through bankruptcy and similar proceedings. The Company reviews financial assets carried at amortized cost for impairment using the lifetime expected loss of the financial asset at initial recognition and throughout the life of the financial asset. TC Energy uses historical credit loss and recovery data, adjusted for management's judgment regarding current economic and credit conditions, along with reasonable and supportable forecasts to determine any impairment, which is recognized in Plant operating costs and other. The Company’s net investment in leases and certain contract assets are financial assets subject to ECL. TC Energy’s methodology for assessing the ECL regarding these financial assets includes consideration of the probability of default (the probability that the customer will default on its obligation), the loss given default (the economic loss as a proportion of the financial asset balance in the event of a default) and the exposure at default (the financial asset balance at the time of a hypothetical default) with one‑year forward-looking information that includes assumptions for future macroeconomic conditions under three probability‑weighted future scenarios. The macroeconomic factors considered most relevant to the Company's net investment in leases and contract assets include Mexico's GDP, Mexico's government debt to GDP and Mexico's inflation. The ECL amount is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in assumptions and forecasts for future economic conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $23 million ECL recovery (2023 – $73 million recovery; 2022 ‑ $149 million expense) with respect to the net investment in leases associated with the in-service TGNH pipelines and $1 million ECL expense (2023 – $10 million recovery; 2022 – $14 million expense) for contract assets related to certain other Mexico natural gas pipelines. Other than the ECL provision noted above, the Company had no significant credit losses at December 31, 2024 and 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no significant credit risk concentrations and no significant amounts past due or impaired. TC Energy has significant credit and performance exposure to financial institutions that hold cash deposits and provide committed credit lines and letters of credit that help manage the Company's exposure to counterparties and provide liquidity in commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate derivative markets. TC Energy's portfolio of financial sector exposure consists primarily of highly-rated investment grade, systemically important financial institutions. Non-Derivative Financial Instruments Fair value of non-derivative financial instruments Available-for-sale assets are recorded at fair value which is calculated using quoted market prices where available including the Company's LMCI equity securities which are classified in Level I of the fair value hierarchy. Certain other non-derivative financial instruments included in Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Other current assets, Net investment in leases, Restricted investments, Other long-term assets, Notes payable, Accounts payable and other, Dividends payable, Accrued interest and Other long-term liabilities have carrying amounts that approximate their fair value due to the nature of the item or the short time to maturity. Credit risk has been taken into consideration when calculating the fair value of non-derivative financial instruments. 212 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Derivative Instruments Fair value of derivative instruments The fair value of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives has been calculated using the income approach which uses year‑end market rates and applies a discounted cash flow valuation model. The fair value of commodity derivatives has been calculated using quoted market prices where available. In the absence of quoted market prices, third-party broker quotes or other valuation techniques have been used. The fair value of options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Credit risk has been taken into consideration when calculating the fair value of derivative instruments. Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments are not necessarily representative of the amounts that will be realized on settlement. In some cases, even though the derivatives are considered to be effective economic hedges, they do not meet the specific criteria for hedge accounting treatment or are not designated as a hedge and are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in net income in the period of change. This may expose the Company to increased variability in reported earnings because the fair value of the derivative instruments can fluctuate significantly from period to period. The recognition of gains and losses on derivatives for Canadian natural gas regulated pipeline exposures is determined through the regulatory process. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as part of RRA, including those that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, are expected to be refunded or recovered through the tolls charged by the Company. As a result, these gains and losses are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets and are refunded to or collected from the rate payers in subsequent years when the derivative settles.

In 2024, unrealized gains of $6 million were reclassified to Net Income (loss) from AOCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges (2023 and 2022– nil). Offsetting of derivative instruments The Company enters into derivative contracts with the right to offset in the normal course of business as well as in the event of default. TC Energy has no master netting agreements; however, similar contracts are entered into containing rights to offset. The Company has elected to present the fair value of derivative instruments with the right to offset on a gross basis on the Consolidated balance sheet. TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 | 217

The following tables show the impact on the presentation of the fair value of derivative instrument assets and liabilities had the Company elected to present these contracts on a net basis: at December 31, 2024 Gross Derivative Instruments Amounts Available for Offset 1 Net Amounts (millions of Canadian $) Derivative Instrument Assets Commodities 418 (290) 128 Foreign exchange 51 (49) 2 469 (339) 130 Derivative Instrument Liabilities Commodities (339) 290 (49) Foreign exchange (238) 49 (189) Interest rate (139) — (139) (716) 339 (377) 1 Amounts available for offset do not include cash collateral pledged or received. at December 31, 2023 Gross Derivative Instruments Amounts Available for Offset 1 Net Amounts (millions of Canadian $) Derivative Instrument Assets Commodities 597 (418) 179 Foreign exchange 111 (16) 95 Interest rate 36 (5) 31 744 (439) 305 Derivative Instrument Liabilities Commodities (458) 418 (40) Foreign exchange (16) 16 — Interest rate (47) 5 (42) (521) 439 (82) 1 Amounts available for offset do not include cash collateral pledged or received. With respect to the derivative instruments presented above, the Company provided cash collateral of $133 million and letters of credit of $59 million at December 31, 2024 (2023 – $57 million and $83 million, respectively) to its counterparties. At December 31, 2024, the Company held less than $1 million in cash collateral and $75 million in letters of credit (2023 – less than $1 million and $12 million, respectively) from counterparties on asset exposures. Credit-risk-related contingent features of derivative instruments Derivative contracts entered into to manage market risk often contain financial assurance provisions that allow parties to the contracts to manage credit risk. These provisions may require collateral to be provided if a credit-risk-related contingent event occurs, such as a downgrade in the Company's credit rating to non-investment grade. The Company may also need to provide collateral if the fair value of its derivative financial instruments exceeds pre-defined exposure limits. Based on contracts in place and market prices at December 31, 2024, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position was $10 million (2023 – $3 million), for which the Company has provided no collateral in the normal course of business. If the credit-risk-related contingent features in these agreements were triggered on December 31, 2024, the Company would have been required to provide collateral equal to the fair value of the related derivative instruments discussed above. Collateral may also need to be provided should the fair value of derivative instruments exceed pre-defined contractual exposure limit thresholds. The Company has sufficient liquidity in the form of cash and undrawn committed revolving credit facilities to meet these contingent obligations should they arise. 218 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Fair Value Hierarchy The Company's financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized into three categories based on a fair value hierarchy. Levels How Fair Value Has Been Determined Level I Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is a market in which frequency and volume of transactions provides pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level II This category includes interest rate and foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities where fair value is determined using the income approach and commodity derivatives where fair value is determined using the market approach. Inputs include published exchange rates, interest rates, interest rate swap curves, yield curves and broker quotes from external data service providers. Level III This category includes long-dated commodity transactions in certain markets where liquidity is low. The Company uses the most observable inputs available or alternatively long-term broker quotes or negotiated commodity prices that have been contracted for under similar terms in determining an appropriate estimate of these transactions. Where appropriate, these long-dated prices are discounted to reflect the expected pricing from the applicable markets. There is uncertainty caused by using unobservable market data which may not accurately reflect possible future changes in fair value. The fair value of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis, including both current and non‑current portions, were categorized as follows: at December 31, 2024 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level I) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level II) 1 Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level III) 1 Total (millions of Canadian $) Derivative Instrument Assets Commodities 126 214 78 418 Foreign exchange — 51 — 51 Derivative Instrument Liabilities Commodities (116) (217) (6) (339) Foreign exchange — (238) — (238) Interest rate — (139) — (139) 10 (329) 72 (247) 1 There were no transfers from Level II to Level III for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company has entered into contracts to sell 50 MW of power commencing in 2025 with terms ranging from 15 to 20 years provided from specified renewable sources in the Province of Alberta. The fair value of these contracts is classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy and is based on the assumption that the contract volumes will be sourced approximately 80 per cent from wind generation, 10 per cent from solar generation and 10 per cent from the market.

30. STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines Portland Natural Gas Transmission System (PNGTS) In August 2024, the Company and its partner, Northern New England Investment Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Énergir L.P. (Énergir), completed the sale of PNGTS to a third party for a gross purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion (US$1.1 billion), including the third party's assumption of US$250 million of senior notes outstanding at PNGTS, split pro-rata according to the PNGTS ownership interests (TC Energy – 61.7 per cent, Énergir – 38.3 per cent). The Company's share of the proceeds was $743 million (US$546 million), net of transaction costs. The pre-tax gain attributable to the Company of $572 million (US$408 million) was included in Net gain (loss) on sale of assets in the Consolidated statement of income, and the after-tax gain attributable to the Company was $456 million (US$323 million). The gain includes foreign currency translation gains of $15 million which were reclassified from AOCI to Net income (loss). TC Energy is providing customary transition services and will continue to work jointly with the purchaser to facilitate a safe and orderly transition. Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf In October 2023, TC Energy completed the sale of a 40 per cent non-controlling equity interest in Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for proceeds of $5.3 billion (US$3.9 billion). The Company continues to have a controlling interest in these companies and will remain the operator of the pipelines. TC Energy and GIP will each fund their proportionate share of annual maintenance, modernization and sanctioned growth capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows, debt financing within the Columbia entities, or from proportionate contributions from TC Energy and GIP. The sale was accounted for as an equity transaction of which $9.5 billion (US$6.9 billion) was recorded as non-controlling interests to reflect the 40 per cent change in the Company’s ownership interest in Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas. The difference between the non-controlling ownership interest recognized and the consideration received was recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital of $3.5 billion (US$3.0 billion), net of tax and transaction costs. At December 31, 2024, as part of the contingent consideration included in the sale, TC Energy accrued a one-time special distribution to GIP of $33 million (US$23 million), or $24 million (US$17 million) net of tax, in Additional paid-in capital. Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines Transportadora de Gas Natural de la Huasteca In second quarter 2024, in accordance with the terms of the Company's strategic alliance, and in exchange for cash and non-cash consideration of $561 million (US$411 million), the CFE became a partner in TGNH with a 13.01 per cent equity interest in TGNH. The transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction of which $588 million was recognized as non-controlling interests and $21 million was recognized as AOCI attributable to the CFE’s non-controlling interest. The difference between these amounts and the consideration received was recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital of $27 million. Power and Energy Solutions Texas Wind Farms In the first half of 2023, TC Energy acquired 100 per cent of the Class B Membership Interests in Fluvanna Wind Farm (Fluvanna) and Blue Cloud Wind Farm (Blue Cloud), respectively. Each of these operating assets has a tax equity investor which owns 100 per cent of the Class A Membership Interests, to which a percentage of earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated. The tax equity investors' interests were recorded as non-controlling interests at their aggregate estimated fair value of $222 million (US$167 million). TC Energy has determined that the use of the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) method of allocating earnings between the Company and the tax equity investors is appropriate as the earnings, tax attributes and cash flows from Fluvanna and Blue Cloud are allocated to its Class A and Class B Membership Interest owners on a basis other than ownership percentages. Using the HLBV method, the Company's earnings from the projects is calculated based on how the projects would allocate and distribute cash if the net assets were sold at their carrying amounts on the reporting date under the provisions of the tax equity agreements.

TC Energy determined it has a controlling financial interest in both projects and has consolidated the acquired entities as voting interest entities. The tax equity investors’ interests were recorded as non-controlling interests at their estimated fair values of $106 million (US$80 million) for Fluvanna and $116 million (US$87 million) for Blue Cloud. These transactions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and therefore did not result in the recognition of goodwill. 31. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES Commitments TC Energy and its affiliates have long-term natural gas transportation and natural gas purchase arrangements as well as other purchase obligations, all of which are transacted at market prices and in the normal course of business. Purchases under these contracts in 2024 were $347 million (2023 – $335 million; 2022 – $314 million). The Company has entered into PPAs with solar and wind-power generating facilities ranging from 2025 to 2038 that require the purchase of generated energy and associated environmental attributes. At December 31, 2024, the total planned capacity secured under the PPAs is approximately 750 MW with the generation subject to operating availability and capacity factors. These PPAs do not meet the definition of a lease or derivative. Future payments and their timing cannot be reasonably estimated as they are dependent on when certain underlying facilities are placed into service and the amount of energy generated. Certain of these purchase commitments have offsetting sale PPAs for all or a portion of the related output from the facility. Capital expenditure commitments include obligations related to the construction of growth projects and are based on the projects proceeding as planned. Changes to these projects, including cancellation, would reduce or possibly eliminate these commitments as a result of cost mitigation efforts. At December 31, 2024, TC Energy had approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditure commitments, primarily consisting of: • $0.4 billion for its U.S. natural gas pipelines, primarily related to construction costs associated with ANR and other pipeline projects • $0.3 billion for its Canadian natural gas pipelines related to construction costs associated with the Valhalla North and Berland River projects. Contingencies TC Energy is subject to laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. At December 31, 2024, the Company had accrued approximately $8 million (2023 – $19 million) related to operating facilities, which represents the present value of the estimated future amount it expects to spend to remediate the sites. However, additional liabilities may be incurred as assessments take place and remediation efforts continue. TC Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, arbitrations and actions arising in the normal course of business. The Company assesses all legal matters on an ongoing basis, including those of its equity investments, to determine if they meet the requirements for disclosure or accrual of a contingent loss. With the potential exception of the matters discussed below, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of such proceedings and actions will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. The claims discussed below are material and there is a reasonable possibility of loss; however, they have not been assessed as probable and a reasonable estimate of loss cannot be made. 222 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

Coastal GasLink LP Coastal GasLink LP is in dispute with a number of contractors related to construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline. Material legal matters pertaining to Coastal GasLink are summarized as follows: Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd. Coastal GasLink LP is in arbitration with one of its previous prime contractors, Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd. (PAPC). Coastal GasLink LP terminated its contract with PAPC for cause, due to the failure of PAPC to complete work as scheduled and made a demand on the parental guarantee for payment of the guaranteed obligations. Following Coastal GasLink LP’s demand on the guarantee, in August 2022, PAPC initiated arbitration. As of December 31, 2024, PAPC purports to seek at least $460 million in damages for wrongful termination for cause, termination damages and payments alleged to be outstanding. Coastal GasLink LP disputes the merits of PAPC’s claims and has counterclaimed against PAPC and its parent company and guarantor, Bonatti S.p.A., citing delays and failures by PAPC to perform and manage work in accordance with the terms of its contract. Coastal GasLink LP estimates its damages to be $1.3 billion. PAPC and Bonatti S.p.A. dispute Coastal GasLink LP's claims and assert that Coastal GasLink LP's damages, if any, are subject to a contractual limit of approximately $220 million. The hearing previously scheduled to commence in November 2024 has now been rescheduled to third quarter 2025. At December 31, 2024, the final outcome of this matter cannot be reasonably estimated. Separately, Coastal GasLink LP has drawn on a $117 million irrevocable standby letter of credit (LOC) provided by PAPC based on a bona fide belief that Coastal GasLink LP’s damages are in excess of the face value of the LOC. PAPC applied for an injunction restraining Coastal GasLink LP from drawing on the LOC pending the completion of the arbitration between Coastal GasLink LP, PAPC and Bonatti S.p.A., but was unsuccessful. Coastal GasLink LP is now able to use the recovered LOC funds. PAPC and Bonatti S.p.A. have amended their original claims to seek additional damages in relation to the draw on the LOC. The amount claimed has not been articulated beyond the $117 million. The parties have agreed that the issue of damages arising from Coastal GasLink LP's draw on the LOC will be determined, if necessary, at a date subsequent to the arbitration hearing noted above. Macro Spiecapag Coastal GasLink Joint Venture Coastal GasLink LP is in arbitration with its former prime contractor, Macro Spiecapag Coastal GasLink Joint Venture (MSJV). In May 2021, Coastal GasLink LP terminated a portion of the work under its contract with MSJV. MSJV continued as prime contractor for the remaining portion of the work; however, it did not complete the remaining work as scheduled. Coastal GasLink LP claims damages in the approximate amount of $560 million for delay, owner indirect costs, contractor replacement costs and repayment of payments made on a without prejudice basis. MSJV has counterclaimed against Coastal GasLink LP for damages for wrongful termination and outstanding costs in the approximate amount of $480 million. An arbitration schedule is expected to be established in second quarter 2025. At December 31, 2024, the final outcome of this matter cannot be reasonably estimated. 2016 Columbia Pipeline Acquisition Lawsuit In 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court (the Court) issued its decision in the class action lawsuit commenced by former shareholders of Columbia Pipeline Group Inc. (CPG) related to the acquisition of CPG by TC Energy in 2016. The Court found that the former CPG executives breached their fiduciary duties, that the former CPG Board breached its duty of care in overseeing the sale process and that TC Energy aided and abetted those breaches. On May 15, 2024, the Court allocated responsibility for the total sale process damages of US$398 million in the amount of 50 per cent to the former Columbia CEO and CFO, collectively, and 50 per cent to TC Energy. Pursuant to the Final Order and Judgment (Final Judgment), TC Energy’s allocated share of the sale process claim damages is US$199 million, plus US$153 million in interest as of June 14, 2024. The Court also entered judgment related to a disclosure claim for which TC Energy’s allocated share of damages is US$84 million, plus US$64 million in interest as of June 14, 2024. The damages for the two claims are not cumulative and TC Energy would only be required to pay the greater of the sale process damages and disclosure claim damages after final determination of those amounts on appeal, including any additional interest assessed to the date of payment. TC Energy disagrees with many of the Court’s findings and believes the Court’s ruling departs from established Delaware law. TC Energy has filed a notice of appeal, which is scheduled to be heard by the Delaware Supreme Court on March 12, 2025. A final decision is expected in mid-2025. During the appeal process, in lieu of paying the judgment, TC Energy posted an appeal bond in the amount of US$380 million, which approximates the amount of the Final Judgment plus nine months of post-judgment interest. The Company’s legal assessment is that it is not probable that TC Energy will incur a loss upon completion of the appeal process, and therefore, the Company has not accrued a provision for this claim at December 31, 2024.

Guarantees TC Energy and its partner on the Sur de Texas pipeline, IEnova, have jointly guaranteed the financial performance of the entity which owns the pipeline. Such agreements include a guarantee and a letter of credit which are primarily related to the delivery of natural gas. TC Energy and its joint venture partner on Bruce Power, BPC Generation Infrastructure Trust, have each severally guaranteed certain contingent financial obligations of Bruce Power related to a lease agreement and contractor and supplier services. The Company and its partners in certain other jointly-owned entities have either: i) jointly and severally; ii) jointly or iii) severally guaranteed the financial performance of these entities. Such agreements include guarantees and letters of credit which are primarily related to delivery of natural gas. For certain of these entities, any payments made by TC Energy under these guarantees in excess of its ownership interest are to be reimbursed by its partners. The carrying value of these guarantees has been recorded in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. Information regarding the Company’s guarantees were as follows: at December 31 2024 2023 Term Potential Exposure 1 Carrying Value Potential Exposure 1 Carrying Value (millions of Canadian $) Sur de Texas Renewable to 2053 93 — 97 — Bruce Power Renewable to 2065 88 — 88 — Other jointly-owned entities to 2032 59 1 24 1 240 1 209 1 1 TC Energy's share of the potential estimated current or contingent exposure. 224 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

32. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES Consolidated VIEs A significant portion of the Company’s assets are held through VIEs in which the Company holds a 100 per cent voting interest, the VIE meets the definition of a business and the VIE’s assets can be used for general corporate purposes. The consolidated VIEs whose assets cannot be used for purposes other than for the settlement of the VIE’s obligations, or are not considered a business, were as follows: at December 31 (millions of Canadian $) 2024 1 2023 2 ASSETS Current Assets Cash and cash equivalents 311 188 Accounts receivable 839 473 Inventories 205 90 Other current assets 121 49 Current assets of discontinued operations — 5 1,476 805 Plant, Property and Equipment 49,904 27,477 Equity Investments 865 823 Restricted Investments 950 — Goodwill 479 439 Regulatory Assets 53 12 Other Long-Term Assets 59 — Long-Term Assets of Discontinued Operations — 172 53,786 29,728 LIABILITIES Current Liabilities Accounts payable and other 1,866 1,092 Accrued interest 202 210 Current portion of long-term debt 2,062 28 Current liabilities of discontinued operations — 43 4,130 1,373 Regulatory Liabilities 1,232 280 Other Long-Term Liabilities 70 46 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities 7 22 Long-Term Debt 12,387 11,388 Long-Term Liabilities of Discontinued Operations — 10 17,826 13,119 1 On April 1, 2024, the NGTL System was classified as a VIE when its ownership was transferred from Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. to NGTL GP Ltd. on behalf of NGTL Limited Partnership. 2 Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf were classified as a VIE upon TC Energy's sale of a 40 per cent non-controlling equity interest on October 4, 2023.

Non-Consolidated VIEs The carrying value of these VIEs and the maximum exposure to loss as a result of the Company's involvement with these VIEs were as follows: at December 31 (millions of Canadian $) 2024 2023 Balance Sheet Exposure Equity Investments Bruce Power 7,043 6,241 Coastal GasLink 1,006 294 Pipeline equity investments and other 160 166 Long-Term Assets of Discontinued Operations Pipeline equity investments and other — 951 Off-Balance Sheet Exposure 1 Bruce Power 1,877 1,538 Coastal GasLink 2 265 855 Pipeline equity investments and other 2 2 Discontinued operations — 56 Maximum exposure to loss 10,353 10,103 1 Includes maximum potential exposure to guarantees and future funding commitments. 2 TC Energy is contractually obligated to fund the capital costs to complete the Coastal GasLink pipeline by funding the remaining equity requirements of Coastal GasLink LP through incremental capacity on the subordinated loan agreement with Coastal GasLink LP until final costs are determined. In December 2024, TC Energy made an equity contribution of $3,137 million to Coastal GasLink LP, which used the funds to repay the $3,147 million balance owing to TC Energy under the subordinated loan agreement. The repayment reduced the Company's funding commitment under the subordinated loan agreement to $228 million. In addition to the subordinated loan agreement, TC Energy has entered into an equity contribution agreement to fund a maximum of $37 million for its proportionate share of the equity requirements related to the Cedar Link project. Refer to Note 7, Coastal GasLink, for additional information. 226 | TC Energy Consolidated Financial Statements 2024

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the TC Energy Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder all the participants are in listen only mode and the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gavin Wylie, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gavin Wylie Thanks very much, and good morning. I'd like to welcome you to TC Energy's 2023 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Joining me are Francois Poirier, President and Chief Executive Officer; Joel Hunter, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; along with other members of our senior leadership team. Francois and Joel will begin today with some comments on our financial results and operational highlights. A copy of the slide presentation that will accompany their remarks is available on our website under the Investors section. Following their remarks, we'll take questions from the investment community. We ask that you limit yourself to 2 questions. And if you're a member of the media, please contact our media team. Before Francois begins, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information, please see the reports filed by TC Energy with Canadian securities regulators and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, during the presentation, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP measures that may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures are used to provide additional information on TC Energy's operating performance, liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. A reconciliation of various GAAP and non-GAAP measures is contained in the appendix of the presentation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Francois. Francois Poirier Thanks, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. At the beginning of 2023, we set out to deliver on 3 clearly defined priorities that focused on maximizing the value of our assets, project execution and enhancing balance sheet strength, and I'm pleased to report that we delivered on all 3 of those commitments. Our focus on safety and operational excellence resulted in high availability and several utilization records across our systems that  󰍉 TRP 󰍝  3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 1/17

contributed to 2023 comparable EBITDA being 11% higher compared to 2022, another record year for operational and financial results. We also announced our intention to spin off our Liquids Pipelines business to create 2 stand-alone investment-grade companies with greater flexibility to implement distinct strategies to unlock their full potential and deliver incremental long-term shareholder value. Our focus on project execution resulted in placing approximately $5.3 billion of projects into service on budget. And our major projects, including CGL and Southeast Gateway, remained on track or ahead of our 2023 targets. We committed to enhance our balance sheet strength through capital rotation and successfully closed the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Columbia pipelines with cash proceeds totaling $5.3 billion and that reduced our 2023 debt-to-EBITDA leverage metric by over 0.4x. A major step towards reaching our 2024 year-end objective of 4.75x debt to EBITDA. And with this positive momentum, building into 2024, we have increased our dividend for the 24th consecutive year and reaffirm 2024 comparable EBITDA outlook to be between $11.2 billion and $11.5 billion. Now after 5 years of construction and 55 million hours worked, we achieved the monumental milestone of mechanical completion on Coastal GasLink. This was one of the most technically challenging pipelines ever built in Canada, and our team applied project execution and safety excellence to deliver this project ahead of our year- end target. Following mechanical completion, we completed the required commissioning process safely in 2023, and we are now ready to deliver natural gas to LNG Canada's facility as soon as they are ready to receive it. Reflecting the team's monumental efforts to achieve these milestones, as the project developer, TC Energy earned a $200 million incentive payment that was settled through a cash distribution earlier this week. Post construction and reclamation activities will continue throughout 2024 with the project remaining on track with its cost estimate of approximately $14.5 billion. The success of this project is not only important for TC Energy and for our customer, LNG Canada. It's a nation-building project that will provide Canada's first direct path for sustainably produced Canadian natural gas to reach global LNG markets. In Mexico, we are making meaningful progress on our Southeast Gateway Marine pipeline. We reached a milestone in the fourth quarter when we began offshore pipe installation for the project. We've now completed 100% of the concrete weight coating on all of the offshore pipe and the remainder of the offshore pipe installation will continue throughout this year. And with all critical permits for construction obtained, the onshore construction at all landfall sites continues to progress on plan. Importantly, the project continues to track schedule and expected cost of USD 4.5 billion as we continue to see benefits from sanctioning this project under our enhanced capital allocation governance process that included a Class III estimate prior to our final investment decision. Now while our utility-like assets do not carry any material volumetric or commodity price risk, continued high utilization throughout the fourth quarter continue to reflect volume growth and the incremental demand for our services that underpins our future investments. Within our integrated natural gas business, total NGTL system deliveries in Canada averaged 14.5 Bcf a day, while our investment base grew by 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., various pipelines achieved record throughput volumes, including our GTN system, which achieved an all-time delivery record of 3.1 Bcf in November. And our Mexico Pipeline's daily throughput was also higher, averaging 2.7 Bcf per day, which is up 30% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 levels. 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 2/17

In our Power and Energy Solutions business, our focus on operational excellence, centers around our assets being available to deliver power when it was needed most. And our Alberta cogen power fleet achieved 99% availability in the fourth quarter, and Bruce Power also had strong performance and averaged a 92% availability throughout 2023, which is well above our historical averages. Bruce Power's Unit 6 returned to commercial operations in 2023 following its major component replacement outage ahead of schedule and within budget. Bruce also submitted its final basis of estimate for the Unit 4 MCR with the ISO in the fourth quarter and we have now received the ISOs approval last week. Unit 4 will be the third of 6 units in the Bruce MCR program, where we are extending its asset life for the next 40 years. This exceptional, emissionless asset produces 30% of the electricity in Ontario. On South Bow, Bevin and team continue to make progress on the proposed spin-off of our Liquids Pipelines business into a stand-alone investment-grade entity. Van Dafoe has been named as incoming Senior VP and CFO. With over 30 years of experience in the energy industry, including being the CFO of a public company for 8 years, Van will be instrumental in leading South Bow's financial and strategic affairs. Additionally, Lori Muratta was named as incoming Senior VP and General Counsel. Lori will oversee South Bow's legal, compliance and regulatory activities, bringing over 20 years of experience in the energy industry and 30 years overall practicing law. For next steps, we expect our proxy circular will be filed in the first half of this year, and we remain on track to advance a shareholder vote by midyear. It is expected that we will hold our AGM concurrently with a shareholder vote on the spinoff transaction. And now I'll turn the call over to Joel. Joel Hunter Thanks, Francois. Strong operational performance during the fourth quarter delivered 16% year-over-year growth in comparable EBITDA. The primary driver of this growth relates to increased comparable EBITDA from our Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines business largely related to the recognition of a $200 million incentive payment upon meeting certain project milestones on Coastal GasLink. This amount was settled through a cash distribution on February 12, 2024, and was recognized as income from equity investments in our consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023. I'll note that even when excluding the $200 million incentive payment, we delivered approximately 8% growth in comparable EBITDA versus fourth quarter 2022. As Francois mentioned, our base business performed exceptionally well during the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, our team safely placed approximately $5.3 billion of projects into service on budget. We also delivered a 24% increase in quarterly comparable earnings relative to last year. This largely resulted from increased comparable EBITDA partially offset by higher interest expense and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests following the Columbia sale in 2023. For 2024, we expect comparable EBITDA to be between $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion, consistent with what we announced at our November 2023 Investor Day. This growth is primarily driven by an increase in the NGTL system, the full year impact of projects placed into service in 2023 and approximately $7 billion of new projects expected to be placed in service this year. Comparable earnings per common share is expected to be lower than 2023, largely due to higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the Columbia sale. Total net capital expenditures for this year are expected to be approximately $8 billion to $8.5 billion. 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 3/17

I'll now discuss a few highlights from our 2024 outlook. Within our integrated natural gas pipelines business comparable EBITDA is expected to be consistent in Canada due to the continued growth of our NGTL system, partially offset by the absence of the Coastal GasLink incentive payment that was recognized this year. Higher in the U.S., largely due to assets placed in service in 2023 and projects we expect to place into service in 2024, including Gillis Access and GTN XPress and higher in Mexico with growth that underpinned by a full year of incremental revenue from the BDR lateral that was placed into service in Q3 2023. With Bruce Power Unit 6 having returned to service comparable EBITDA from our Power and Energy Solutions business is also expected to increase relative to 2023. Without taking into account impacts related to the proposed spin-off, comparable EBITDA from the Liquids Pipelines business is expected to be consistent with 2023. Consistent with what we showed at Investor Day and excluding contributions from the Liquids Pipelines business, shown on the left-hand side of this slide, Comparable EBITDA out to 2026 is expected to be in the range of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion. Growth out to 2026 is underpinned by high-quality assets that are expected to be placed into service further supported by the highly rate-regulated and long-term contracted nature of our business. I'll note that recent announcements related to our Heartland project and the Bruce Unit 4 MCR, were included in our net capital expenditures outlook shown at Investor Day. These projects do not change our commitment to limiting net capital spending to $6 billion to $7 billion with a bias to the lower end in 2025 and beyond. Looking to the right-hand side of this slide, South Bow's long-term outlook also remains consistent with what Bevin showed at Investor Day. The South Bow team expects to see comparable EBITDA growth averaging 2% to 3% out to 2026 delivering low-risk, double-digit shareholder returns. Bevin and his team have the intention to have the majority, if not all, of the capital structure in place prior to the spin-off, subject to a successful shareholder vote. Anticipated proceeds from the senior and subordinated debt issued at South Bow will be used to repay approximately $8 billion of TC Energy debt and help meet future funding requirements. Underpinned by our strong performance last year, TC Energy's Board of Directors has declared a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.96 per common share which is equivalent to $3.84 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 3.2% year-over-year increase. This is the 24th consecutive year the Board has raised the dividend which is foundational to the enduring value proposition of TC Energy. Thank you, and I'll pass the call back to Francois. Francois Poirier Thanks, Joel. We had a great success in 2023, focusing on executing a clearly defined set of priorities that directly align to our strategic vision and value proposition. So for 2024, there should be no surprise that our strategic priorities will look very similar to 2023. First, we'll continue to maximize the value of our assets through safety and operational excellence and by successfully executing the spin-off of South Bow. Second, we will remain focused on project execution delivering on time and on budget, including Bruce Power's MCR-3 and advancing Southeast Gateways mechanical completion by the end of 2024. And third, we will continue our path to achieving and sustaining our 4.75 debt-to-EBITDA upper limit by the end of 2024 by advancing our divestiture program and continuing to streamline our business through our efficiency efforts. 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 4/17

By executing on our high-quality secured capital program, we expect to deliver 2024 comparable EBITDA of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion and incremental long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Rob Hope of Scotiabank. Robert Hope Questions on Mexico. So [indiscernible] we had over half the spend out the door already. As we take a look into 2024, what key milestones should we be watching for? What do you view as the highest risk factors? And how is spend -- have you seen an increase in any contingencies there? Stanley Chapman Rob, this is Stan. As Francois pointed out, we have no change in our cost or schedule, and we're continuing to track to the $4.5 billion cost estimate in summer 2025 in service date. And we spent about $2.5 billion or so to date. We'll spend another $1.5 billion this year and about $500 million or $600 million or closing things out in 2025. Just a couple of highlights. As of earlier this week, we've laid about 225 kilometers, which is about 34% of our subsea pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico. The work that we're doing onshore is progressing nicely at all three of our landfalls. As a matter of fact, at [ Potecio ], we actually completed our drill last week on time and on schedule. The micro tunnel that we're building in [indiscernible] should be completed sometime by the end of this month. So going forward, when I think about next milestones, we should have all of the deepwater portion of the subsea pipeline completed by early summer. The shallow water tie-in work should be completed by the end of the summer. And then the compressor work will be completed this fall so that we could then turn our attentions to commissioning activities and putting the project in service for summer 2025. So no changes to capital costs, no changes to contingencies at this point in time, but the project is progressing nicely as planned. Robert Hope Excellent. And then just keeping on Mexico, is there any updated thinking on how to get to the 10% Mexico EBITDA limit? And is this more of a near-term or a longer-term target? Or where can we see some additional clarity there? Francois Poirier Rob, it's Francois. I'll take that one. As we've said before, we remain committed to reducing our exposure as a percentage of consolidated EBITDA. That 10% threshold was prior to the spin or post spin, if we're successful, probably more in the 12% range. We are exploring a variety of different avenues to begin lowering our exposure. We are prepared to transact in 2024 but we're not going to give up shareholder value to do that. We're progressing nicely on construction on Southeast Gateway. So we're going to take our time and do this in an orderly fashion. And look over the next 2 or 3 years to be reducing to that 10% to 12% level. 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 5/17

Operator The next question comes from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Theresa Chen Maybe hitting on that last point and you put it into the broader asset divestiture program. As you seek to delever towards your target by the end of this year, can you provide any updates on the progress of additional asset sales this year and just the steps from here transaction timing, size and such. Anything we can think about there? Francois Poirier Theresa, we have a number of processes in market right now. So I'm going to maintain deal discipline to every extent possible, but still try and help you here. As we've mentioned in the past, we're not looking to do a single transaction to achieve the $3 billion like we did last year with the very sizable GIP transaction think of us doing anywhere from, let's say, 2 to 4 transactions to get to that $3 billion number. Those smaller transaction sizes tend to widen the buyer universe because more people can write those check sizes. So we have seen good interest in the different processes that we have underway. These processes tend to have their natural pace and cadence. We're hopeful that we'll be able to make at least one announcement in the first half of the year. But again, we're going to be disciplined and make sure that we're preserving value for our shareholders. Theresa Chen That is helpful. And then turning to South Bow and the anticipated growth post spin in order to aid in its own deleveraging. When we think about the potential upside opportunity in Marketlink going forward, just given the many moving pieces in that [ mid content ] or Permian to Gulf Coast part of the world. So you have no certain competitors expanding capacity, others having contract roll off near term, others converting crude back to NGL service and vice versa. How should we think about market length potential expansion earnings with this background? Bevin Wirzba Theresa, this is Bevin. You basically just acknowledge the premise for the spin. There's a tremendous opportunity for South Bow to address the tremendous demand that we've been seeing in the Gulf Coast. We had over 150,000 barrels additional demand on our Marketlink system here in the last half of 2023. And that allowed us to underpin over 200,000 barrels a day of incremental contracts on that Marketlink system here in the balance of the year. So we accelerated a bit of the growth that we were anticipating in '24 into '23. A lot of that came from -- I've shared previously the [ fingers and toe ] strategy. So we added the Port Neches Link last year on time and on budget, and that began seeing consistent flows providing that additional outlet for those customers on Marketlink. In addition, we brought on the capability to hit Tidewater. So as you mentioned, many are providing different access to Tidewater. We have 6 terminals that can now provide that capability for our customers. So our South Bow strategy is to leverage that pre-capitalized system on the Gulf Coast, but also we're seeing similar 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 6/17

opportunities in Alberta where we have underutilized or under -- we've already capitalized our Grand Rapids system, for example. And bringing on additional volumes onto that system is very accretive. And so that underpins our ability to have our own capital structure to attend to those opportunities is a really strong opportunity for our shareholders. Operator The next question comes from Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish Maybe just back to the asset sales for a second. I'm just wondering how the interest rate environment could influence the timing of asset sales over the balance of the year. I mean, I know you mentioned you expect to potentially transact at least one deal in the first half of this year. But I think the general consensus is that interest rates will fall over the balance of the year. So does that favor maybe weighting towards the latter half of the year to announce more asset sales. Just curious for your thoughts on that, whether that makes a difference in how you perceive the cadence of sales. Francois Poirier Thanks, Praneeth, interesting question. As I said in the Theresa's prior question, these transactions tend to have their own cadence and momentum is a very powerful thing. No question that in the current environment, certainly, when you're thinking about financial buyers that the underlying interest rate environment does have an impact on valuation. We're being really disciplined here. We're not in a rush. The agencies have given us the feedback that we do have until the end of 2024 to get to our below the upper limit of 4.75 debt to EBITDA, and we're going to take our time. And it's not lost on us that as monetary policy starts to ease in the second half of the year, we may benefit from that. But having said that, our first priority is to achieve a minimum of $3 billion of divestitures and to do that by the end of the year. And while we're not going to undertake prior sales, if we see reasonable value today, we will transact on it. Praneeth Satish Got it. And then it looks like gas deliveries from power -- gas deliveries to power plants set another record. Just wondering if you could talk about how much of this uptick is being driven by demand from data centers as that seems to be picking up quite a bit here. And whether you're seeing any data centers reach out to you directly for gas supply to maybe power cogen units and go around the grid. Stanley Chapman This is Stan. I can take that one. Data centers, as you know, tend to be high demand consumers that need a constant and reliable energy source such as provided by natural gas, and we are looking at several options across our footprint. That includes some of our smaller pipes out West, opportunities on the Columbia system in Virginia. And maybe most recently on ANR, where the assets that we have in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin are going to indirectly serve Microsoft's new data center via a local distribution company that will be in between us 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 7/17

and them. So Yes, this is a growing demand source for us and something that we are well aware of and expect to take advantage of in the future. Operator The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet Just wanted to kind of expand on the LNG outlook, I guess, as well, with the moratorium in the U.S., just wondering your thoughts, I guess, on positioning for West Coast Canada there, future growth and possible expansion on those facilities, it seems like with the cost put into those facilities overall, economies of scale would argue for further expansion. Just wondering how you see North American LNG export outlook going forward and the impact on [indiscernible]. Francois Poirier I'll start at a high level there, Jeremy, and then I'll ask Stan to provide a little bit more detail. Look, we're the only gas transmission company that has a dominant footprint in all three countries, and we have access to all shores of North America. So LNG demand growth is as our customer is going to be a big source of our growth going forward. You're right, brownfield economics typically beat greenfield economics all day long. So where we are already serving LNG export, we see opportunities for us to grow throughput. And Stan, over to you for a little bit more detail. Stanley Chapman Jeremy, just to maybe double click on that. From a macro perspective, we're exporting around 14 Bcf of LNG from the U.S. today. We see that growing to somewhere north of 30 Bcf by the end of the decade. Across all of North America with maybe 3 to 4 Bcf coming from Canada and 2 to 3 Bcf coming from Mexico. But you also referenced the moratorium or the stay and maybe just a couple of points on it. First of all, the stay impacts about 20 or so projects that are currently in the approval queue, but it does not impact projects that are already approved. So projects like our Gillis project, which is slated for in-service later this year, and our East Lateral Xpress project, which is slated for in-service in 2025 are not going to be impacted. But today, our assets transport about 25% of the delivered LNG terminals, and those two projects are just going to further enhance that. A bigger picture, though, what I would note is it really is the diversity of our pipeline network across North America, which is one of our biggest strengths. And we're going to continue to see strong demand for our assets across the LDC, power generation and LNG export sector and should a pause in LNG exports in the U.S. be extended for a significant period of time. The geographical diversity that our pipelines afford us may well see opportunities both in Mexico and Canada. And as a matter of fact, we heard the Canadian Energy Minister, Wilkinson, expressed that exact sentiment just a few weeks ago. Jeremy Tonet Got it. That's very helpful. And Stan, maybe kind of expanding on the U.S. gas pipe network outlook. Just wondering, as far as future growth is concerned, where do you see, I guess, more of the growth coming from? Is 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 8/17

Page 9
it just more of these kind of bolt-ons? Or do you see the potential for anything like bigger brownfield expansions or even greenfield expansions here just given increased, [ peaking ] need for natural gas across the U.S. Stanley Chapman Again, given our best-in-class footprint, we're going to leverage our in-corridor expansions to the greatest to be possible. So I don't see us doing a lot of greenfield expansions. Particularly it makes it more challenging on the permitting and the construction front. But I continue to point out to you the growth in the power generation sector and our Heartland project that we just announced today is another example of that, where coal fire power generation is retiring, demand for energy continues to grow, and our assets are uniquely positioned to fill that gap. So growth in power generation, both in LNG exports longer term, as well as increased connectivity with our LDC customers, I think, are going to be the main drivers for our U.S. pipes. Operator The next question comes from Linda Ezergailis of TD Cowen. Linda Ezergailis Just wondering if you can give us any update on how you're progressing on your productivity and cost effectiveness initiatives in your natural gas business. Where are you at in terms of identifying opportunities and implementing them. Stanley Chapman Linda, this is Stan. I think you're referring to what we call our Project Focus initiative and you may recall that, that is all about creating value by fundamentally changing the way we do our work around safety, operational excellence and cost and capital discipline. Last year, we announced a target run rate of about $750 million of efficiencies that would be realized by the end of 2025. And you can think of that as being made up of things like capital reductions, expense reductions and revenue enhancements. At the end of last year, we actually captured and implemented run rate efficiencies of about $230 million. We expect to generate another $270 million of efficiencies by the end of this year. So we'll have a cumulative amount of around $500 million. And the balance of the $750 million will be generated in 2025. So I would say things are progressing nicely and according to plan. Linda Ezergailis And maybe just as a bigger picture follow-up. Realizing that you've got a lot of priorities. I'm just wondering if you could also give us a regulatory update in terms of how you're thinking about any sort of significant natural gas pipeline filings, any sort of settlements and with the backdrop of the Chevron Doctrine being challenged as well, maybe influencing how you approach your regulatory relationships. I mean it's been pretty foundational for the agencies being able to interpret any sort of ambiguous statutes in the U.S. and that the courts would defer to that. And if that gets discarded or clawed back, just any sort of early thoughts on how that might shift your approach to managing your regulatory relationships and strategies. Francois Poirier 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 9/17

Page 10
Linda, I'll start and pass it over to Stan for a bit more detail. Just sort of bigger picture pulling up to 40,000 feet. We've had very good success getting permits for our projects. As a matter of fact, we recently received FERC approval for one of our projects in Virginia, about 4 months early. So it's going to allow us to actually accelerate a little bit of our capital spend, which will generate incremental EBITDA earlier than we had expected, and that's going to improve the IRR of the project. As a general matter, as you know, we're spending more capital on maintenance because the utilization of our assets is so high. So we are, as a strategy in order to minimize regulatory lag in the United States going to be continuing to file rate cases more frequently, wherever we are allowed to do that. And of course, we are going to be proceeding in that regard on Columbia in 2025. With respect to the Chevron doctrine and some of the other details, I'll kick it over to Stan. Stanley Chapman Yes. Linda, I would maybe preface my remarks by saying that given that we are making as an industry and a company, long-term, large dollar capital investments in [indiscernible] energy infrastructure predictability and stability in the regulatory, judicial and legislative process is really critical for us. I really don't see absent there being something unforeseen. A drastic changes in terms of how we file and prosecute rate cases, for example, due to the Chevron doctrine. And that you may recall that in the U.S., most of our rate cases tend to be settled with our customers rather than litigated nor do I see there being any significant changes with respect to how we operate the pipe. Given that this could lead to more of the tedious outcomes, we may have to build in longer lead times for originating and constructing our projects. But at the end of the day, we need to wait and see what if anything comes out of the Supreme Court decision, and then we'll respond to those changes accordingly. Operator The next question comes from Ben Pham of BMO. Benjamin Pham Maybe to go back on the asset sale program. You mentioned more positive backdrop year-to-date versus last year. I'm wondering what's your willingness then to maybe perhaps execute on more than $3 billion this year and just push the leverage down even more. Francois Poirier Ben, we have an openness to that but it's going to be on the basis of compelling valuations in our various processes, given that we want to make sure that we achieve our $3 billion target for 2024. We've got many conversations going on, not only is there competition within processes, but there's competition between processes. So to the extent we could see some compelling valuations, we would be open to considering exceeding the $3 billion target. Benjamin Pham Okay. Got it. And then maybe a question on liquids performance this year and going forward, just given the better result, I guess, for [indiscernible] or so, doesn't that warrant or just more directionally, maybe a bit more upside ties to your middle decade EBITDA guidance for the liquid segment? 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 10/17

Page 11
Bevin Wirzba So Ben, this is Bevin. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned earlier, we were able to accelerate a little bit of the growth that we're anticipating in '24 back into '23. I do want to temper our outlook for Q1 of this year. As you know, we have a marketing affiliate that optimizes the utilization of our Gulf Coast system primarily. And we have some basically accounting differences between physical and financial trades that we think we'll have a bit of a headwind here in Q1. So I'd just temper our results here in the near term. We want to reaffirm our outlook of that 2% to 3% long-term growth that is we believe we'll be able to underwrite that growth consistently, and that's what we want to be as a very predictable deliver of EBITDA growth for our shareholders. Operator The next question comes from Brian Reynolds of UBS. Brian Reynolds Maybe to follow-up on some of the South Bow questions as it relates to the future debt issuance used to repay TC just given some of the outperformance we've seen [ center ] spend from TC, but also liquids and now you have the $200 million CGL payment, which it sounds like that wasn't originally in the guide because you had made some performance metrics. Just kind of curious if we could see any evolution, whether it's a couple of hundred million here or anything more material as it relates to that ultimate debt issuance to TC from South Bow. Bevin Wirzba Yes. So Brian, this is Bevin again. So first off, we are going to come out with an investment-grade rating post the successful shareholder vote will be going out to the market, which, fortunately, we've seen some improvement in the debt capital markets here over since the announcement of the spin back in July. We'll look to set up that capital structure that allows us to underwrite the future performance. And if we're able to have -- we have to balance the needs of both TC and South Bow as we divide the dividend and the debt going forward, and we'll optimize that for our shareholders. But right now, I would say it's more constructive than what we would have thought last July. So that's a good thing for the outlook of both entities. Joel Hunter Brian, it's Joel here. I'll just add to that, too. And what we showed you at Investor Day back in November is that just given the current rate environment, the proceeds that we'll receive from South Bow where it's around $8 billion that we have the ability to buy back some of our debt to discount. So we expect to take out more than what the proceeds are from South Bow given that our debt would be trading at a discount. Brian Reynolds Sounds like more to come. On Northern Border switching to the gas side, Natgas constraints seem to get into a pretty tough level at this point with expansion really need it soon. So kind of just curious if you can give us an update on Bison Xpress. And ultimately, how does that flow through to it's potential cost implications as it relates to your $6 billion to $7 billion outlook. You guys are very committed to that, kind of how does the basins need for expansion intertwined with your commitment to that $6 billion to $7 billion outlook. 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 11/17

Page 12
Stanley Chapman Yes. I would just say that our Bison Xpress project is progressing as planned. We have every expectation of bringing that in service on time line budget. And as you pointed out, there is a need for additional [ egress ] capacity out of the basin. These dollars are included in our $6 billion capital plan going forward and the expectation on executing on that accordingly. Operator The next question comes from Robert Kwan of RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan On the back of the sanctioning of Heartland and as it relates just to the placeholder CapEx in your plan through 2026, can you just talk about what segments and what types of projects would be the largest contributors, especially the 2026 bucket. And with that comment, just specifically building on stand [ dancer ], if the pause on the non-FDA export permits is made more permanent? How much of that grade bucket is at risk? Francois Poirier It's Francois. I'll take that one, Robert. When you think about our capital stack, not just in 2026, but as a general matter, think of about $2 billion a year of recoverable maintenance capital across our 3 pipeline systems would be one contributor. Secondly, $800 million or $900 million a year on average of Bruce Power capital for the major component replacement program as well as the Project 2030 efficiencies on the non-reactor side of the plant. And then predominantly growth capital across our 3 natural gas footprints. When you look at our projects and the impact of the pause on the capital stack. As Stan mentioned, one of our projects, Gillis could be impacted by any meaningful delays in its sanctioning. But these are small dollars, low hundreds of millions. And so as we mentioned at our Investor Day in November, our capital is pretty much spoken for through '26 and now with the Heartland project '27 we haven't increased the aggregate limits. In November, we included some of the unsanctioned capital in our disclosures, both the MCR 4 at Bruce and Heartland were in November in the unsanctioned or as yet to be sanctioned growth. And we remain steadfast in our focus on maintaining our capital spend, not just within the $6 billion to $7 billion, but frankly, to the lower end of that range from a value creation standpoint, the prize there is if we execute on plan for roughly $6 billion a year, and it might be plus or minus $100 million or $200 million in any given year, then we have excess capital to either accelerate deleveraging or to ultimately proceed with share buybacks. We're building in that optionality on an annual basis which is something that we have not done in the past. So from my perspective, if for some reason, a project -- an individual project is deferred and we end up at $5.5 billion instead of $6 billion, for example, we still have good uses for that capital in accelerating our deleveraging and ultimately doing share buybacks because those are value accretive to our shareholders. Robert Kwan And if I can just finish with the interplay between the 4.75x target and the comments on executing the asset sale program in a manner that is positive to shareholder value or put differently, that you're not going to fire sale 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 12/17

assets. If the markets work against you, how are you thinking about that target, particularly as well into 2025, which is kind of just a bridge year at roughly a Southeast Gateway and really the goal being 2026. So how do you, like I said, think about that target in 2025 as well. Francois Poirier Yes. So good question, Robert. Based on conversations we're having and how our processes are going to date, we're very confident on achieving the $3 billion number in 2024, and we are steadfast in achieving that amount of deleveraging. It's a high priority for us to get to below 4.75 upper limit by the end of 2024. With respect to 2025, we would need either incremental divestitures or incremental EBITDA above $400 million of incremental EBITDA in order to stay below that 4.75 level. And to the extent as was asked previously, we have an opportunity to perhaps upsize the program in '24, we'll consider that. We also feel that we can get to the $3 billion number without transacting in Mexico in 2024. But as we said, we're focused on reducing our exposure in Mexico over the next 2 or 3 years to get to that 10% to 12% of consolidated EBITDA level. So you could look to us pulling on some of those levers, including how successful our efficiency program is around revenue increases and cost reductions to fill any gaps that we see in 2025 and beyond. Operator The next question comes from Robert Catellier of CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier Congratulations on all the accomplishments in 2023. I had a quick follow-up on the liquid side. I wondered if you could give an update on where you are with Keystone in returning that asset to its previous level of pressure? Bevin Wirzba Robert, this is Bevin. So we've had, as I mentioned earlier, outstanding performance operationally here year-over- year, we continue to increase our system operating factor. We achieved record levels here at the end of the year and early this year. That is only as a result of our prime focus on operating our system very safely, and that included doing all the integrity work last year. We've done full in-line inspections on over 80% of our system to date. That will be all complete prior to any spin transaction. In doing those in-line inspections as well as all of the physical digs over 60 digs this past year to do confirmation of anything that we do see in areas of potential concern, we have found no potential incident or issues with the integrity of our systems. So our confidence increased significantly here since undertaking that work. We're working very closely with both our regulators, both [ FIMSA ] and the United States as well as the CER we've managed to address all the issues so far that they have raised. But their determination is up to them as to returning the system to its original operating pressure. That said, because of our operational performance, we were able to deliver all of our contract capacity, and we've been able to move spot batches as well. So our operational excellence is allowing us to continue to deliver strong performance. Robert Catellier 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 13/17

Okay. Thanks for that detailed answer, Bevin. I just wanted to move on to the asset development and the regulatory side. Specifically on cost sharing on development costs before projects are permitted. I wondered if you've -- what your approach there is to cost sharing might be in light of the high utilization of assets across the industry and just the tough permitting environment. And maybe specifically, you can address what type of progress you're making with government funding for predevelopment on key projects in Ontario, such as the Ontario pump storage. Francois Poirier Thanks, Robert. I'll start with a very high level. I'll ask Stan to provide some context on cost sharing in the U.S., and then Annesley can touch on our Power and Energy Solutions projects in Ontario. And the only comment I wanted to make before passing it over is that just to remind you that in Canada, we have mechanisms to have reimbursement of development costs or inclusion of development costs as spent in our tariff structure and so the notion of cost sharing for development is really more of a U.S. question rather than one in Canada. So over to you, Stan and then over to Annesley. Stanley Chapman Robert, again, I would just reiterate, first of all, that the progress in all of our projects is going really, really well. This year, we're on track to put 3 projects in service. We put our Virginia electrification project in service on time and on budget. A couple of weeks ago, later this summer, we'll put our Gillis project into service. And then assuming we get timely and favorable recurring order on GTA and we'll put the balance of that project in service by the end of the year. With respect to things like risk-sharing mechanisms, we've been doing that for a very, very long time in the U.S. As a matter of fact, many, if not almost all of our projects have some sort of a cost sharing that's usually around a 50-50 split between us and our customers, should we have cost overruns. We also have other protections where in certain instances, should a customer not reach FID, they will reimburse us for 100% of our development costs. That's something that we've been doing for a long time, just as part of our DNA. The regulatory slides with respect to building projects has gotten a little bit more complex. But I think we have the skills and the talent to navigate that. And I see us continuing to originate and build new projects within this 5 to 7x build multiple and within our $6 billion go-forward annual capital spend. Annesley Wallace Robert, it's Annesley. In the Power and Energy Solutions business, our near-term focus is really on nuclear and pumped hydro. And a big part of the reason for that is the policy support that we see for both of those 2 sectors, particularly in Ontario. And so we are in discussions with the province on cost recovery agreements for those projects. As we progress them, we will remain very disciplined with respect to our capital that we would put at risk. And so we do anticipate advancing those agreements in the near term, both with respect to the work that we have begun on Bruce Power, a nuclear new build [ Bruce C ] at that site as well as our Ontario pump storage project. Operator The next question comes from Patrick Kenny of National Bank Financial. 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 14/17

Patrick Kenny Just on CGL and these potential cost recoveries from contractors, I'm not sure if you can comment on or confirm if all claims have been filed with the courts at this point, what the total amount of all claims might look like? And also if you've assumed any successful litigation or settlements within your 4.75 leverage target by year-end or if we should be thinking about these potential recoveries being 2025 at the earliest? Greg Grant Yes, sure. It's Greg Grant here. I'll go first, and then Joel can talk to the 4.75. But First, just given, you gave me the mic, I'm going to thank the team again. I think this is a monumental effort that the team was able to achieve here on CGL. It took everybody operations, commercial, project execution, stakeholder team effort to achieve the readiness by the end of the year. So that $200 million was quite important to the team. As you think about moving forward into 2024, safe execution is the mandate and what we're going to continue to focus on as we work through some of the reclamation work. We're not really going to get into talking about individual claims or what that looks like. I think what I would say is we will vigorously defend the claims, but also in pursuing cost recoveries, which we do expect net recoveries and just to highlight, we remain on track to the $14.5 billion. Joel Hunter And Pat, it's Joel here. Just with respect to the net recoveries that Greg has highlighted, we're not going to give you a dollar amount on that, but we do factor that into our funding plan here as it relates to this year. Patrick Kenny Okay. Great. And then just on NGTL. I'm wondering if you might have an update on where you're at with rolling over the 5-year revenue requirement settlement. And I know you can't comment too much either on what a potential minority stake in NGTL might look like. But just curious if having the new revenue settlement in place represents any sort of precursor to executing on any type of ownership transaction with NGTL? Greg Grant Sure. Greg here. I'll talk about the settlement. Just as a reminder, settlements in place until the end of 2024 discussions are going well with customers. Can't talked too much around the actual settlement itself. But you've seen the system and the health of the basin here recently, we've hit all-time highs on NGTL here in January, continuing to seeing significant usage in decade level highs heading out of mainline. So we're quite happy with the health of the basin. I think the conversations are going well with the customers. We'll be looking probably not until midyear before we start to get closer to settlement, but we expect a settlement with customers here later this year where we can comment more. Francois Poirier 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 15/17

Page 16
And with respect to the impact of the settlement on the timing of any potential minority interest sale on NGTL, Pat, we obviously have -- it's public information that our settlement expires at the end of the year that we are working towards a renewal of that settlement with our customers and we have, in our own minds of view as to what a fair outcome is, and we will obviously factor that into our view of fairness of any transaction for a minority interest in NGTL. Operator The next question comes from Olivia [ Halpert ] of Goldman Sachs. Unknown Attendee Wondering if we could just start on Bruce. Availability continues to be strong, though I acknowledge the maintenance heavy fourth quarter. Is there any planned maintenance you can point us to for 2024 and more broadly following the successful and accelerated MCR on Unit 6. Are there any lessons learned that you can apply to future MCRs and how much conservatism would you say is baked into the MCR time lines? Annesley Wallace Olivia, it's Annesley. I'll take that question. So we definitely did see strong performance from Bruce Power last year across both the operating units as well as with the performance of Unit 6 MCR program. Heading into 2024, we can expect availability to be similar to what we've seen in 2023. So we expect continued strong performance. There will be regular planned outages as we also saw in 2023. But that is factored into that guidance. From a MCR perspective, we certainly have taken many lessons learned from the Unit 6 MCR project and have applied them to the planning and the execution of the future units. So we're currently in execution on Unit 3, and we're seeing some of the benefits of those lessons learned already on Unit 4. It will be a similar story. Beyond just the lessons at Bruce Power, we have also certainly engaged with industry and have continued to apply lessons learned from outside of Bruce Power as well. Maybe the last thing I would highlight with respect to Bruce Power performance for 2024. We do expect our annual price increase to come in April, and so we'll share more at that point in time. Unknown Attendee Okay. And then I guess, just more broadly on the 2024 EBITDA guidance, what is the largest driver of potential variability and maybe you could sensitize what could drive performance to the high end versus the low end of the target growth range. Francois Poirier Thanks for that question, Olivia. We don't take a meaningful amount of commodity price or volumetric risk. So essentially, the drivers of performance for us are operational excellence through strong availability of our assets and bringing in our projects on time and on budget. So if we perform according to plan, we will fall within that range. And to the extent we find more efficiencies or increased availability in operations, you could see us move to the upper end or as you saw in 2023 above the upper end of the range of our guidance. And then the other factor, of course, is on delivering on our projects on time. 3/1/25, 2:57 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1869584038&ts=3027472&ref=l6cin7 16/17

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the TC Energy First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gavin Wylie, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gavin Wylie Thanks very much and good morning. I'd like to welcome you to TC Energy's 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. Joining me are Francois Poirier, President and Chief Executive Officer; Joel Hunter, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; along with other members of our senior leadership team. Francois and Joel will begin today with some comments on our financial results and operational highlights. A copy of the slide presentation that will accompany their remarks is available on our website under the Investors section. Following their remarks, we will take questions from the investment community. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. And if you're a member of the media, please contact our media team. Before Francois begins, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information, please see the reports filed by TC Energy with the Canadian Securities Regulators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, during the presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures that may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures are used to provide additional information on TC Energy's operating performance, liquidity, and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. A reconciliation of various GAAP and non-GAAP measures is contained in the appendix of this presentation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Francois. Francois Poirier Thanks, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. We set out with three clearly defined priorities for 2024 that focus on maximizing the value of our assets, project execution, and enhancing our balance sheet strength. And I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver on all of these commitments.  󰍉 TRP 󰍝  3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 1/18

We saw another quarter of record earnings with comparable EBITDA up 11% compared to the first quarter of last year. With a relentless focus on safety and operational excellence, the company saw high availability and utilization across our asset base, including multiple first quarter all-time records. Our secured capital program continues to progress on plan and we are tracking the cost and schedule with our major projects, Southeast Gateway and the Bruce Power Unit 3 MCR. In March of 2024, the USD 300 million Gillis Access project was placed into service with a build multiple of approximately 6x. This greenfield pipeline system connects gas production sourced from the Gillis hub to downstream markets in Southeast Louisiana. Gillis, along with projects on our NGTL system, mean that we've placed approximately $1 billion of projects into service so far this year, largely on budget. Additionally, $200 million of maintenance capital was placed into service over the quarter. We continue to execute against our $3 billion asset divestiture program with the recent sale of PNGTS for expected pretax proceeds of approximately CAD 1.1 billion which includes the assumption by the purchaser of USD 250 million of senior notes outstanding at PNGTS. We also continued to progress the proposed spin-off of South Bow. As you saw a couple of weeks ago, we released our management information circular and the shareholder vote is scheduled for June 4. Finally, we're pleased to announce Sean O'Donnell as our incoming Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective May 15, following Joel's decision to pursue another opportunity. We're grateful for Joel's 26 years with TC Energy and the incredible impact he's made on the company, and I'll reserve a few more thank yous for Joel in my closing remarks. As for Sean, he joined TC Energy 6 months ago as part of our succession planning and brings 30 years of invaluable energy industry experience, including past roles as CFO. This paired with his tenure and corporate finance and private equity, aligns directly with our clear set of strategic priorities. In Mexico, we continue to achieve milestones in the construction of Southeast Gateway. The total offshore pipe installation is now over 70% complete. The offshore portion represents about 670 of the total 715 kilometers of pipeline length. Onshore, all critical permits for construction have been obtained, and we have completed construction on all 3 landfall sites. Importantly, the project continues to track schedule and expected cost of USD 4.5 million. Continued high utilizations across our integrated natural gas system in the first quarter reflect continued demand growth for natural gas in the markets we serve. Total NGTL system deliveries in Canada averaged 15.3 Bcf a day with a new daily record high of 17.3 Bcf achieved in January. In the U.S., daily average flows of 30 Bcf were up 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. Once again, various pipelines achieved record throughput volumes, including in our Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf and Great Lakes systems. Natural gas demand growth is continuing in powering the U.S. as electricity demand grows. 2023 was a record year for power burn across the U.S. and that strength is continuing into 2024. Mirroring that, our assets continue to support the record demand and we set a first quarter record for deliveries to power generators of 2.9 Bcf per day, up 11% versus the first quarter of 2023. New growth drivers like data centers will help continue that positive growth momentum. In Mexico, average daily throughout was nearly 3.0 Bcf per day, up 13% versus the first quarter of last year. In our Power business, our power assets were available to deliver power when it was needed most resulting in an increase to comparable EBITDA of 14% versus the first quarter of last year. As you all know, Bruce Power 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 2/18

produces 30% of the electricity in Ontario, and Bruce met continued demand in the first quarter by providing and delivering availability of 92%. We continue to expect average availability in the low 90% range for 2024, which is a significant and gradual improvement over the last decade or so. The Bruce Power major component replacement program to extend the asset life for the next 40 years, continues to progress on plan. Unit 3 is tracking, cost and schedule and Unit 4 received the ISOs approval to begin in early 2025. Our Alberta cogeneration fleet also delivered strong performance and reliability in the quarter with overall portfolio availability of 98.7%. There continues to be strong demand for our transportation service in our Liquids business, and Keystone is meeting this demand, achieving 96% operational reliability in the first quarter. This operational strength supported a 28% increase in comparable EBITDA as compared to the first quarter of last year. Turning to South Bow and the proposed spin-off of the Liquids Pipeline business. Bevin and the South Bow team continue to make meaningful progress towards the South Bow business, transitioning to a stand-alone public company. We are confident we will have a successful launch of an independent South Bow in late Q3 or Q4 of this year. We do not anticipate any material dis-synergies related to South Bow as the Liquids business was operated mostly as a stand-alone business within the broader TC Energy, and we intend to offset any potential dis-synergies in the year in which they would have otherwise been incurred. Further, the team plans to develop the Blackrod Connection project. This project is expected to underwrite a meaningful portion of South Bow's near-term comparable EBITDA growth targets. We issued our management information circular on April 16, and you may have seen that leading proxy adviser, ISS, has come out with a supportive recommendation for the transaction. As described in the circular, favorable tax rulings have now been received in both Canada and the U.S. Our 2024 Annual and Special Meeting will be held on June 4. I hope you take the time to look at the information in the circular and on our website to support your voting decision. And now I'll turn the call over to Joel. Joel Hunter Thanks, Francois, and good morning. Exceptional operational performance during the first 3 months of the year delivered 11% year-over-year growth in comparable EBITDA. As Francois mentioned, we saw strong year-over- year increases across all of our business units, including a 14% increase in Power and Energy Solutions, driven by increased availability, and in our Liquids business, a 28% increase in comparable EBITDA driven by higher utilizations on both the Keystone and MarketLink systems. We also delivered a 4% increase in quarterly comparable earnings relative to Q1 of last year. This largely resulted from increased comparable EBITDA, partially offset by higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests following the Columbia sale in 2023 and higher interest expense primarily due to long-term debt issuances net of maturities, partially offset by reduced levels of short-term borrowings and higher capitalized interest. We reaffirm our outlook for 2024, which does not take into consideration the proposed Liquids Pipelines spinoff. As a reminder, in 2024, we expect comparable EBITDA to be between $11.2 billion and $11.5 billion. This growth is primarily driven by an increase in the NGTL system, the full year impact of projects placed into service last year and approximately $7 billion of new projects expected to be placed into service this year. As a reminder, the $7 billion includes Coastal GasLink, which is expected to be placed into commercial in service later this year. At the end of April, we placed approximately $1 billion of projects into service, including Gillis Access and the Columbia Gas Virginia Electrification project. Comparable earnings per common share is expected to be lower than 2023, largely due to higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the Columbia sale. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 3/18

Total net capital expenditures for this year are expected to be approximately $8 billion to $8.5 billion. We continue to actually manage our fixed floating interest rate mix, which helps to insulate us from rising rates. Approximately 92% of our debt is fixed with an average term to maturity of approximately 17 years and a pretax weighted average coupon of approximately 5.3%. We are making progress towards our asset divestiture program with the announced sale of PNGTS, which will put us over 1/3 of the way towards our $3 billion target for 2024. This transaction implies a valuation multiple of approximately 11x 2023 comparable EBITDA. We remain committed to achieving our 4.75x debt-to-EBITDA target in 2024, the upper limit to which we will manage to and expect to announce incremental asset sales in the coming minutes. Related to the Liquids spin-off, shareholders of TC Energy, as the distribution record date established for the spin-off will receive 1 new TC common share and 0.2 South Bow common shares in exchange for each TC common share. As highlighted on this slide, dividends are expected to remain whole following the Liquids spin-off. In addition, we expect to have the capital structure in place prior to the spin-off, subject to a successful shareholder vote on June 4. Anticipated proceeds from the senior and subordinated debt issued at South Bow were used to repay approximately $7.9 billion of TC Energy debt and help meet future funding requirements. Our long-standing value proposition sets the foundation for continued operational and financial strength, insulating us well from volatility we see in the broader market. Our stable, low-risk business model and highly utilized asset portfolio provides stability in our comparable EBITDA and cash flows. TC Energy's Board of Directors has declared a second quarter 2024 dividend of $0.96 per common share, which is equivalent to $3.84 per share on an annual basis. As we look ahead, both TC Energy and South Bow are expected to maximize respective value propositions in a manner that will benefit shareholders for years to come. I've had a great career here at TC Energy. As you know, I'm moving on to a new opportunity, but I am truly grateful for my time with the company. TC Energy has been a great place to work, and I appreciate everything I've been able to accomplish during my time here. As Francois mentioned, effective May 15, Sean O'Donnell will step into the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And I'll remain part of the team and as an executive adviser until my last day on July 1 to support a seamless transition. TC Energy is in good hands with Sean, who has tremendous amount of experience in the energy industry and expertise across North America. Now with that, I'll pass the call over to Sean for a few words. Sean O'Donnell Thanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. As I've mentioned to many of our stakeholders over the past several weeks, I am very excited for the opportunity to succeed you as the next CFO of TC. For our shareholders, I want to highlight that I, like Joel, will be focused on the continued successful execution of the 2024 strategic priorities that Francois detailed earlier. I look forward to connecting in person with as many shareholders as possible over the coming months. But for now, I'll turn the call back over to Francois for his closing remarks. Francois Poirier 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 4/18

Thanks, Sean. I'm happy to share that we once again delivered record results, supported by our relentless focus on safety and operational excellence. Our priorities for this year are very clear: first, continue to maximizing the value of our assets through safety and operational excellence; second, remaining focused on project execution delivering our projects on time and on budget, including Southeast Gateway and Bruce Power's Unit 3 MCR, and third, we will continue on our path to achieving and sustaining our 4.75x debt-to-EBITDA upper limit by the end of the year by advancing our divestiture program and continuing to streamline our business through efficiency efforts. Before I turn it over to the operator, I would like to take a moment to thank Joel for his contributions to TC Energy over his 26 years with the company. Joel, you've been a valued member of the TC Energy team. I know you share our passion and commitment to the strategic path we're on, and I look forward to working with you until midyear. Also on behalf of the entire team, we wish you the best in your next opportunity. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Pham of BMO. Benjamin Pham Maybe to start off on the asset sales. You mentioned potential -- additional asset sales in the coming months. Can you talk about then just really anything has changed with respect to the buyer interest, those -- the federal budget change perhaps some of the discussions on the NGTL and the federal loan guarantee for First Nations? And then CFE a purchase that you've disclosed. Is that going to be included in that $3 billion target? Francois Poirier Ben, it's Francois. Thanks very much for the question. Things have been progressing very well on all fronts on our divestiture program. I can report that yes, the CFE's purchase of an equity interest in TGNH is included in that number. I can report that the CFE has received all approvals for its investment. They have secured the funds, and we are in the final throes of negotiating documentation and we can expect to receive proceeds in exchange for an approximately 15% interest, perhaps as early as next week. I will remind everyone that this transaction was negotiated at the outset of the Southeast Gateway sanctioning and consideration provided by CFE includes not only cash but also assets in kind as well as them agreeing to take on certain risks disproportionately around land acquisition and permitting as well as a disproportionate percentage of cost overruns by virtue of them taking on 50% of those with only a minority interest in TGNH. So we're very optimistic about that occurring as early as next week. On other asset sales, we're focusing on Canada in the near term. The budget does not have any impact on our ability to proceed nor have we seen any impact on prospective valuations? We have a couple of processes that are reasonably well advanced in Canada, and we could expect to announce additional divestitures in the second quarter if progress continues on the positive path that it is on. Beyond that, we continue to focus on other divestiture opportunities to progress our divestiture plans and deleveraging plans, whether it's in Mexico, where we are in conversations with a number of parties, we're also exploring FIBRA E as a potential alternative as well as a number of other assets -- smaller assets in our portfolio. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 5/18

Page 6
So we're very confident in the $3 billion number, and we look forward to announcing more positive progress over the coming months. Operator Our next question comes from Rob Hope of Scotiabank. Robert Hope I want to ask a question on increasing power demand driving increasing gas demand, which you noted in your prepared remarks. How are you seeing this kind of manifest itself across your system? And what opportunities does it provide in both your gas and pipeline -- out of gas, pipeline and power business. And I guess as a kind of an offset there would be, could we see renewed interest in additional power investments on a longer-term basis? And kind of what does this mean for the Ontario storage project? Stanley Chapman Rob, this is Stan. I will start and then pass it over to Annesley. I want to make sure that you all have a proper appreciation for the really strong growth story that's going on right now due to operational excellence that our teams have demonstrated and we're seeing record deliveries across all of our jurisdictions. In Canada, flows on the NGTL system are up 5% quarter-over-quarter, including strong deliveries not only to power generators, but also within the oil sands. In Mexico, our flows are up 13% quarter-over-quarter led by higher volumes on both our Sur de Texas system and the Topolobampo system. And similarly, across the U.S., our throughput was up 5% quarter-over-quarter with new record deliveries to power generators, leading the way, our power generation deliveries were up over 11% quarter- over-quarter. A matter of fact, over the past 6 months, 6 of our 13 pipelines in the U.S. set new record peak day deliveries, again, just showing the demand for the assets that we have, and we're well positioned to continue to capture that growth with projects like our Heartland project on the ANR system that we announced last quarter. Somebody is probably going to ask about data centers in particular. So it's probably a good time to bring that up right now. We do see a meaningful load and growth opportunity increased demand in coming years due to data centers. When we look and do the math that we think somewhere between 6 to 8 Bcf of increased gas demand between now and 2030 is more than reasonable, but there are also higher forecasts out there that exceed 10 Bcf a day. Reliability requirements associated with data centers are also driving increased appreciation for the role that natural gas is going to play in supporting those loads as well. We believe that much of the data center load is likely to materialize behind LDCs as opposed to be directly connected to our mainline pipes. And given that and given our best-in-class pipeline footprint, which happens to connect to 8 of the 10 largest LDCs across the U.S., it's just a reinforcement of our strategy to increase connectivity with LDCs be permittable, constructible in- quarter expansions with long-term take-or-pay contracts, particularly in data center hungry areas like Virginia and Wisconsin. So if you noticed the disproportionate amount of the projects that we announced over the past couple of quarters are in those 2 states, and that's why. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 6/18

Annesley Wallace Thanks, Dan. So I'll speak to the power part of your question, Rob. Our Power and Energy Solutions strategy really remains for the near term to focus our investment in nuclear and pumped hydro. We have continued great opportunity through our investment in Bruce Power to deploy capital dollars. Nuclear is baseload generation that will continue to support it. And then our Ontario pump storage project, which I think you spoke to specifically, we continue to have really great support from municipalities and local communities. We received just in the last couple of weeks, another city -- municipal council vote in support of the project. We also feel really strongly along with our partners, the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, that the project will offer Ontario, really good socioeconomic benefits, $6.8 billion to the economy in present value terms over the life of the project 90% of which will benefit Ontario directly and much of that is in rural communities. That said, as we continue to progress the project, we are very mindful that we will not continue to invest capital dollars without having a cost recovery increase commercial framework in place. We're very optimistic. We continue to work with the province, but that is sort of what our near-term focus is on securing that agreement. Robert Hope Appreciate that. And then maybe as a follow-up and more broadly, through the years, we've seen TC Energy kind of shift capital between its power and pipeline business recognized right now on the power side and the focus is on the pump storage as well as nuclear. But in a world where North America short power in a number of years, if gas-powered generation can give you good risk-adjusted returns and good contractual backlogs. Could we see you kind of reinvigorate kind of your development pipeline on that side of the business? Annesley Wallace For right now, we really are focused in the near term on nuclear and pumped hydro. We're committed to adhering to our $6 billion to $7 billion capital spend commitment. It's not to say that we wouldn't opportunistically look at those opportunities given exactly what you've described relative to power demand, but it would have to fit within that $6 billion to $7 billion limit. Stanley Chapman And what I would add, Rob, it's Francois, is that we've had a couple of assets achieve or reach contract expiry, we've been able to renew and extend those contracts, which obviously protects the terminal value of our businesses. The one example I'd point you to is in New Brunswick, our cogen. We were able to extend that contract, and we've got other assets such as Becancour, where we are in very positive conversations with potential customers about extending and entering into new contracts just to continue to perpetuate those cash flows. So the dynamic around natural gas demand and power demand is very positive. That's exactly at the intersection of the strategy for the new TC. We are a gas and power company focusing on growing our gas franchises in all 3 countries as well as growing our investment in primarily emissionless power going forward, but also extending the life of our existing natural gas power generation assets. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 7/18

Robert Hope Joel, all the best in the new role, and Sean, congratulations as well. Operator Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet Joel, I want to wish -- best wishes going forward as well. Sean, congratulations. And just wanted to, I guess, start off, it seems like the business continues to kind of perform pretty well and exceed the expectation again here. And just wondering, I guess, how you see things, I guess, performing versus Analyst Day expectations at that point and how you think things unfold going forward? Francois Poirier I appreciate the question, Jeremy, and the acknowledgment of the strong performance we've delivered. This is why we have a very short set of priorities in 2024 as we did in 2023, and it begins and ends with strong execution. We are laser focused on improving the return on invested capital on our existing assets and then delivering on our new projects on time and on budget and essentially delivering the business cases that we brought forward to our Board of Directors, and we are performing exactly on that plan. We reaffirmed our guidance for 2024 prior to giving effect to the spin transaction because the timing could move around plus or minus a month at $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion of EBITDA. We remain confident and reaffirm that guidance. And there are a lot of things that contribute to where you end up in that band or outside of that band. Asset availability is a critical driver. It's a great opportunity to create upside with no capital. You've seen through laser focus of our operating groups, a huge focus on increasing the availability of our assets. We've talked about that in our prepared remarks in a fair amount of detail. We see that as low-hanging fruit to continue to perform or even beat our expectations. For now, we're going to under promise and over deliver and reiterate our guidance as is for the remainder of the year. Jeremy Tonet Got it. Understood. And there seems to be some debate in the marketplace with regard to credit rating agencies, if S&P were to downgrade TRP, just wondering if you could walk us through what type of impact that would have on the company hybrids, et cetera? Francois Poirier I'll provide a couple of overall comments and then pass it on to Sean who, as our SVP of Capital Markets and Planning has been managing the dialogue with the rating agencies. And all I will say, first off, is that we are performing exactly to the plan. We provided all rating agencies in our review last summer in advance of the announced intention to spin our business, and we continue to execute against that plan. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 8/18

But over to you, Sean. Sean O'Donnell Yes. Thanks, Francois, Jeremy, good to be connected, I just want to reiterate, as a new voice on the phone, the commitment to these deleveraging plans remain exactly intact. I'm picking up where Joel left off. And as it relates to what the agencies are doing, back to Francois's comment, we engaged with them last year significantly across their advisory services and developing these plans. They know very well all of the moving parts, and we remain in regular contact with each of the agencies quarterly. We've been on the phone them all this week. And as interim updates whenever they ask for it for each of our kind of ongoing initiatives. So while I don't believe any company can or should predict what any one agency may or may not do. Your specific question about a particular notch downgrade. We've seen some of our peers get downgraded in the last couple of weeks and the bond market didn't move but for a basis point, no market reaction whatsoever. And I think you have such disparate kind of views across the agencies. Investors are just taking kind of their own point of view on it. And as it relates to what would be the pricing impact across our complex, the JSN are pretty far out, right? We've got a call date, but our maturity stack on the JSNs doesn't really arrive until 2027. So we've got a lot of time. And importantly, our deleveraging plan that sits with all the agencies shows this 4.75%, very stable for the long term. So we feel really good about it and virtually no impact should anything like that happen. Operator Our next question comes from Linda Ezergailis of TD Cowen. Linda Ezergailis I have a two-pronged question. Your Alberta natural gas storage business appears to have outperformed significantly in the quarter. I'm wondering just help us understand maybe a breakdown between that and your lower business development costs to just get a sense of the magnitude of the outperformance? And is there something onetime in nature? Or can there be some new emerging opportunities given some of the shifts in market dynamics? Annesley Wallace Linda, it's Annesley. Thanks for the question. So the outperformance in the gas storage business in Q1 was what drove the results there. The impact of the business development cost was much less significant. And the operational outperformance was really a result of us being able to capitalize on the severe weather event that happened in January. So the storage business benefits from the price volatility in the market, and we were able to deliver those results. It isn't something that you would expect to see quarter-over-quarter because it was related to the severe weather event, but we have demonstrated an ability to take advantage of those types of events in the past. And to the extent they were top in the future, we would expect the same thing. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 9/18

Page 10
Linda Ezergailis And just as a follow-up, recognizing that this might be somewhat opportunistic and provide a valuable service during some extreme times for the industry. How are you seeing the economics potentially improving for natural gas storage? Is there any contemplation of brownfield or potentially greenfield storage anywhere in your network? And can you comment on how that might become an increasing proportion of your natural gas-related infrastructure opportunities? And maybe this is also a question for Stan. I don't know. Annesley Wallace Yes, I can start, and then I'll pass it over to Stan. I think with respect to the unregulated gas storage business that we have in Canada, our focus is really just to continue to maximize the value of the exceptional assets that we have as part of that business. But Stan, maybe you want to comment further. Stanley Chapman Linda, as you know, we're one of the largest storage owner operators in North America and do see a lot of value in storage going forward. In the aggregate, we operate around 650 Bcf of capacity with about 530 that here in the U.S. With respect to our storage position in the U.S., high demand for continues. We're in our eighth consecutive year of having 100% of our storage capacity fully contracted for. Our storage is heavily located in our market area, and over 80% of the storage is subscribed by our LDC customers who rely on it as a source of their peak day needs. Maybe a bit in contrast, much of the discussion going on today with respect to new storage is pertaining to locales in the Gulf Coast in response to demand volatility around LNG exports. And there's meaningful differences between those types of merchant storage activities versus our more integrated storage approach with our storage being integrated with our LDC customers that come with long-term contracts that are take-or- pay in nature and have synergies back to the pipeline. So from my perspective, when I look at the opportunities going forward, I don't see us chasing these merchant opportunities that do not have synergies or are not integrated with our assets. But I do see us building more storage that complements our best-in-class footprint through either enhancements and drilling new wells to our existing storage footprint, or in some cases, constructing new storage or even LNG peaking facilities as we have operated historically in the eastern part of our system. Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish If I could switch to South Bow. So you've talked about an initial leverage ratio there 5x. Has anything changed with respect to your thinking of the capital structure there in light of the higher interest rate environment? And then secondly, can you comment on any discussions? You mentioned that you're talking to the rating agencies frequently. Any discussions with them as it relates to the creditworthiness of South Bow, and what 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 10/18

Page 11
leverage profile would be consistent with investment-grade credit rating. Bevin Wirzba Yes. sorry, Praneeth, it's Bevin here. So first off, I'll address your last question first, I guess, is, we just recently went back to the credit agencies here just a few weeks ago with my CFO, Van Dafoe, outlining the update of our plan, you've seen the outperformance this past quarter. of the business as well as bringing forward the Blackrod project, which is credit accretive and so very solid ground with respect to our leverage profile of South Bow with the agencies coming out being investment grade, a commitment that we made in the information circular, that went out. With respect to our capital allocation priorities and your comment around the interest rates, our capital allocation priorities are, first, are deleveraging the way we can -- because we believe that deleveraging is accretive to the equity investor. The way we can achieve that on an accelerated basis compared to what we highlighted at Investor Day is allocating capital to Blackrod. That project is a very short cycle project, will be on in early 2026. Cash flows can be created off that asset at the low end of our EBITDA build multiple range at the 6x level. That allows us to really accelerate our delevering in the face of that interest rate environment that you point out. Our second priority is in capital allocation is organic growth in that build multiple range with Blackrod. We achieved just about 60% of our EBITDA growth CAGR that we highlighted at Investor Day. So that's strong. And then with discretionary capital, we want to look at the bottom, want to have the opportunity to do share buybacks or over the long term, increase the dividend. And as you may have pointed out, starting with deleveraging is critical given the interest rate environment, but also getting our payout ratios closer in class with our peers is another priority. Joel Hunter Praneeth, it's Joel here. I'll just add on a few comments here. We've been working closely with Bevin's team as well. With the capital structure, it will be across the term spectrum are anywhere from 3 years out to 30-plus years, including junior subordinated notes that will comprise about $1.5 billion of the capital structure. So nothing has changed from where we were last summer. And then more importantly, in the interest rates, we looked at where we're at today relative to where we were last summer, actually the rates were in slightly. So again, despite the rise in rates over the last 3 or 4 months, on an all-in basis, they still remain very favorable to where we were when we first budgeted for this last summer. Praneeth Satish Got it. No, that's helpful. I'm going to go back to the AI theme because it's an interesting one. So there's only, as you know, 2 pipelines that flow right through the heart of data center Valley in Northern Virginia, Columbia is one of them. I mean, I know you touched on it, but can you talk about any discussions you've had with utilities that are coming to you requesting or anticipating more gas in preparation for more load growth? And then if so, how easy do you think it will be to accommodate this additional demand in terms of expanding your system? Let's say, you pick up 1 to 2 Bcf per day of that plus 6 to 7 Bcf of incremental gas demand that you quoted. I mean how much can you handle with compression versus new build? 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 11/18

Page 12
Stanley Chapman Yes, Praneeth, this is Stan. I appreciate the question. And again, just to reiterate, the overall opportunity is probably somewhere around 6 Bcf a day by 2030. When you look at places like Virginia, in particular, we do have one data center that we are already serving that is actually tied into our mainline facilities. But again, I think that, that's a bit of an anomaly in data center growth, either directly contracting with power generation loads or behind the LDC. So our strategy is going to be continue to increase our connectivity with the LDC loads. If you look at some of the annual plans that the LDCs are filing, you're seeing that they are representing that strong growth going forward. In terms of assets that will take, it's probably going to take more than compression. It's going to be a combination of pipe and compression and back from a liquid supply source. So we continue to be bullish on Appalachian production. As we said in the past, that production is constrained only by takeaway path. And we think that when you look at our systems and the path that we can deliver from TECO pool over to these data centers in places like Virginia, in particular, uniquely positions us amongst our peers. Operator Our next question comes from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Theresa Chen Stan, I wanted to follow up on this theme and just go back to that 6 Bcf number that you highlighted earlier. How did you come to that number? What are the assumptions driving that as of late to your system. In terms of the [indiscernible] and as a follow-up to Praneeth's question, what kind of CapEx should we think about as this evolves? Stanley Chapman Yes. With respect to the 6 Bcf a day number, again, I look at that as not anything that's proprietary to us, but a kind of a midpoint of the various analyst summaries that were done by parties like Wood Mack and EIA and others. And again, we're seeing estimates as high as 10 Bcf, which I think are a little bit aggressive given the fact that there's likely to be some supply chain challenges with associated build-out, it's going to take a little bit longer don't have specifics for you with respect to capital investments. Again, I think this is going to play out over the next several years through the end of the decade. I can tell you that we are in discussions with various entities to get these types of loads attached to our system, but it's going to play out. Francois Poirier What I'd add to that, Theresa, it's Francois, is while we remain very focused on living within our means and at the lower end of that $6 billion to $7 billion range. What this means is that after giving effect to our maintenance capital of roughly $2 billion a year, and we've got about $1 billion a year committed to Bruce. We've got $3 billion a year approximately of discretionary opportunities to deploy capital. And that long-term trend presents us with a 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 12/18

Page 13
very high degree of confidence of being able to attract very high return attractive investment opportunities and continue to be able to deliver a very healthy spread between earned returns on projects and our cost of capital. Stanley Chapman And maybe one last thing I would add, Theresa, is even though we're going to compete for and win [ Archer's share ] of the data center load, there's another way to serve it indirectly, which is by getting increased deliveries to the power generators. And do keep in mind that there's about 10 gigawatts of coal-fired power-generating facilities that are scheduled to retire here by the end of 2030, that are within 15 miles of our assets. So I think we're well positioned to capture that part as well. Operator Our next question comes from Robert Kwan of RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan If I can start with Southeast Gateway, there's -- you had some updates on that, but I'm just wondering if you can compare where you are versus Sur de Texas in terms of some of the productivity. And then if you can also just comment on some of the major remaining critical path items are basically what keeps you up at night on the rest of the project. Stanley Chapman Robert, this is Stan. Thanks for the question. We're in a really good place with respect to the project right now. As we noted earlier, 70% of the offshore pipeline is completed, which includes 100% of the Northern segment. We recently brought the vessel into port for some scheduled maintenance. It's going to be going back out to complete the about 189 kilometers of the southern portion of the deepwater pipeline here shortly. We're also progressing on the nearshore work as well as the facilities work, which is adding compressor stations at 3 landfalls. And the fact that we have all 3 of our drills completed is a big deal for the team. So we're excited with respect to where the project is right now. In terms of challenges for the future, really, it boils down to weather risk and maintaining the productivity that we've seen both with the vessel offshore and the work that the team is doing onshore. When I think back to some of the lessons learned against Sur de Texas that we're going to be implementing here is that we're going to do the subsea tie-ins below the water line rather than on the water line, and that takes a lot of this weather risk out of play. So the team is well engaged. We're in a good position, and I'm excited that we're remaining on track both with respect to scheduling costs for the project. Robert Kwan That's great. If I can just finish on the asset sale program. You've noted you've got multiple processes ongoing. But just due to the butterfly divestiture limits, post spin, does that cause you to focus a little bit more on the 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 13/18

Page 14
processes that you can close quickly and/or are you thinking about trying to monetize a little bit more than $3 billion just to take out or derisk the 2025 program. Francois Poirier Thanks, Rob. It's Francois, and I appreciate the question. Based on the time lines we have on our various processes, we see us being able to close a sufficient amount of additional transactions prior to the spin, such that the 10% limit that's included in the CRE order, if you will, is not going to impair our ability to complete our deleveraging program, whether it's all in 2024 or some of it leaks into 2025. So we're very comfortable with our ability to achieve that below our upper limit of 4.75 in 2024 and then remain there as we go forward. And I will also point out that not only is 2024 an anomaly with us retaining a portion of the liquids EBITDA for part of the year. So as 2025, we're putting $9 billion of assets into service in 2025, but only have a partial year benefit there. Starting in '26, we're going to have the full year benefit for all of those assets. And that in itself is going to continue to accelerate our deleveraging below the 4.75 upper limit. Robert Kwan That's great. Thank you very much, and Joel, all the best. Operator Our next question comes from Robert Catellier of CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier Congratulations on the strong operating results. I wanted to go back to the capital structure question, starting with South Bow. Right now, TC Energy has the benefit of an enviable maturity profile. I'm wondering what you see as the average maturity profile for South Bow, what's your vision for that? Bevin Wirzba Yes, Rob, we'll access the full stack. But on average, you should use 10 years as a good rough guideline of the maturity profile that we'll be seeking. But we'll be putting from 3s, 5s, 10s, 30s all in the stack as we go out. Robert Catellier Okay. That's helpful. And then I have sort of the same question for TC Energy. Basically, when that capital stack has stood up at South Bow in that $7.9 billion mix way back to TC Energy. It sounds like you're very determined to stay at the 4.75 leverage or below. But is there a -- do you have any thoughts on the term? Can you afford to shorten that term of 17, 18 years as you redeem debt to manage your interest rate exposure there? Joel Hunter 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 14/18

Page 15
I'll start here and then, Sean, if you want to chime in. Great question, Rob. A couple of reminders here. The weighted average term of our debt is 17 years. Over 90% of our debt is at fixed rate. So when you think about $7.9 billion coming back to TC as it relates to South Bow, part of those funds will be used to just fund our capital program for this year. Part of the funds will be used to reduce our -- some of our long-term debt. In the grand scheme of things, it's not going to really change the weighted average. We'd rather have a longer term to maturity with our debt and have a very manageable maturity profile. It's why we've always managed the capital structure within TC Energy, such that we average about $2.5 billion per year of debt maturities, and that will continue going forward. So when we look at the money coming back here, again, part of it will be for the funding this year's capital program, part will be to reduce our debt and it should have a negligible impact on our weighted average term to maturity for debt. Robert Catellier Okay. Great. And last one for me. I just wanted to go back to the NGTL potential sale there. My understanding was that the amount you could sell there is practically limited by the indigenous loan guarantee programs. And I just wonder whether or not that's changed with the federal budget announcement for more loan guarantees? Francois Poirier Robert, it's Francois. To the extent we can avail ourselves of indigenous loan guarantees beyond the one that the AIOC is generously providing. We would certainly consider that. But I would highlight that we have a number of processes competing with one another at this time. And I think given the commercial sensitivities of our discussions, I won't comment further. Operator Our next question comes from Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley The South Bow resulted another really strong quarter. Just curious how much of this do you view as sustainable for the -- as a run rate and how much is some of the spread-oriented upside on Keystone that's a little harder to predict in the future. Bevin Wirzba Keith, it's Bevin. Yes, we -- first thing is operational excellence. We achieved 96% of system operating factor in the first quarter, having our systems available to capture the arms, our strategic franchise connecting Northern Alberta down to the Gulf Coast, making that corridor available can attract barrels and having a system operating factor that high allows us to track more barrels. So the first quarter, we had outstanding results, both on Keystone, but also on MarketLink where we were able to add some additional contracts this year. So year-over-year on MarketLink, we've strengthened our contract profile on MarketLink adding around 200,000 barrels. So when you think about our system and our corridor, just 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 15/18

Page 16
strengthening that franchise is just attracting barrels because that's where the barrels want to go as the Gulf Coast. We want to temper our outlook though. We have -- we do have TMX linefill coming. It's starting right now. And so we already have seen some narrowing of that arb on the Keystone system, but I want to remind everyone that our Keystone contracts are effectively are 94% contracted with an 8-plus year term. So only 6% of that volume on Keystone is subject to spot or variable tolls. But our ability to continue to move spot barrels on our system is what we anticipate, but I don't anticipate us being as strong as the first quarter. Keith Stanley That's helpful. Second question, just a follow-up on Southeast Gateway. It sounds like it's going very well. If it did come on early in 2025, would you expect to start collecting the contract fee early as well? Or is that not necessarily the case? I'm just curious how that would work under the contract, if you are early. Stanley Chapman Yes. This is Stan. Under the contractual terms with CFE, our counterparty, they will pay us upon in-service date in summer of 2025 and not necessarily earlier. Operator Our next question comes from John Mackay of Goldman Sachs. John Mackay I wanted to circle on just some of the leverage comments around 25%. Certainly, I understand the amount of EBITDA coming online midyear. But I guess are you guys still targeting necessarily hitting 4.75 by the end of '25 as well? And if so, last call, you talked about needing some incremental EBITDA or maybe some incremental asset sales, just how we should frame that up. Francois Poirier The short answer, John, is yes. With respect to filling any gap to gap because of the partial year in 2025 is about 0.2. There are 3 sources of deleveraging that can fill that gap. The first is outperformance from an EBITDA perspective. You've seen us here in the first quarter deliver results that were above plan. That's come from excellence in operations. Our focus initiatives where we're reducing cost. FX has provided a nice tailwind for us here in the first quarter. Secondly, to the extent we're able to deliver on our projects below plan, that will also have a positive impact on our credit metrics. And then if and only if -- the gap is not filled by the first 2, we would consider additional asset sales to remain below that 4.75. And we're going to let the year play out a little bit before we make that kind of decision because, again, I think we're performing very well right now, and we see line of sight to being able to address that gap from all 3 of those different levers. John Mackay 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 16/18

Page 17
All right. That's very clear. I appreciate that. Maybe just one more for me. On the $6 billion to $7 billion of kind of outer year capital that you're committing to and more recently, your language has kind of been holding to that lower end. I guess just how much of that, if we're looking forward a couple of years, has already spoken for existing projects? And then how much would be in there for some of these incremental opportunities, data centers, et cetera, that you could still add to the backlog without going above that level? Francois Poirier Appreciate the question. Look, our bias to the lower end of that $6 billion to $7 billion is really important to us. We value the option value of performing to plan. So if we stay at the lower end of the $6 billion to $7 billion in terms of the planned capital, if we perform to plan on time and on budget, that gives us up to an incremental $1 billion every year to either accelerate debt repayment or eventually perhaps even undertake some share buybacks. One of the beauties of our business is we have a very predictable line of sight to allocating our capital in the future. I can tell you that in terms of our internal plans, I have visibility to where the capital is going to go down to specific projects with specific returns virtually until the end of the decade. That's the beauty of the predictability of our business. We do have an opportunity to add incremental projects at attractive returns. Going forward with some of the positive dynamics we're seeing in data centers and other demand growth, but that's more middle of the decade and beyond. I will point out that it took us a couple of years to respond to the Wisconsin request to harden the infrastructure from extreme cold that came from Winter Storm Uri. And so the data center and other electricity and natural gas demand increases we're seeing across the board, I'm going to take a couple of years to materialize. So we do see an opportunity for us to crystallize some of those, but more in '26, '27 and beyond. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Kenny of National Bank Financial. Patrick Kenny Just on Coastal GasLink, can you remind us the scope of work to be done to support Cedar LNG? And what sort of EBITDA build multiple you might be able to achieve there? And then any thoughts on any work that might be needed to prepare for a potential Phase 2 from LNG Canada or perhaps any other floating LNG projects that might come down the road into next year and beyond? Francois Poirier Thanks, Patrick. It's Francois. I'll take this one. Look, on Cedar, first of all, we're having a very close relationship with the Haisla Nation. We're very excited and very happy for them to be making positive progress on the project. It's going to create wealth for the nation and advance their socioeconomic goals. This is a project that we are contractually committed to proceeding with. We are in the process of advancing our development of the project cost and execution plan. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1878236087&ts=3109261&ref=l6cin7 17/18

Page 18
So we're not at this time able to share a build multiple. But I will tell you that the allocation of risk between parties commercially is considerably different from what we experienced on Phase 1. We're very comfortable with the quality of our estimate and the allocation of risk between parties such that if we do allocate capital, and it would be modest capital from our perspective, given that we own 35% of CGL, and there will be project financing to fund a significant component of the project cost. We're very comfortable in our ability to fit that equity capital within our $6 billion plan. Patrick Kenny Okay. Got it. And then maybe just back to your asset sale process. Just in light of the recent rule changes here announced to the Alberta power market. I know it's not a huge part of the portfolio, but any thoughts around, a, how you think your gas-fired power assets are positioned to perform once these new rules take effect? And then b, just your overall desire to remain a key participant in the Alberta power market going forward just in light of these changes. Annesley Wallace It's Annesley, and I'll take the question. So with respect to the changes to the Alberta electricity market that has been announced, we do not anticipate any direct impact to our cogen fleet in Alberta. It could be that as a result of the changes, there are some indirect impacts to the longer-term outlook for power prices. But we have already considered this in our outlook, and so don't anticipate any material changes there. With respect to the overall strategy, again, our focus is really on maximizing the value of the cogen assets that we have in Alberta, which really comes down to ensuring really good operations, strong operational excellence will lead to maximum availability, particularly during peak pricing. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. If there are any further questions, please contact Investor Relations at TC Energy. I will now turn the call over to Gavin Wylie. Please go ahead. Gavin Wylie Well, thank you, and thanks, everyone, for participating this morning. If we didn't get to your question, if you have any additional questions, obviously, the Investor Relations team is always at your disposal and happy to help out where we can.

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the TC Energy Second Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Gavin Wylie, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gavin Wylie Thanks very much, and good morning. I'd like to welcome you to TC Energy's 2024 second quarter conference call. Joining me are Francois Poirier, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sean O'Donnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; along with other members of our senior leadership team. Francois and Sean will begin today with some comments on our financial results and operational highlights. A copy of the slide presentation that will accompany the remarks is available on our website under the investors section. Following their remarks, we'll take questions from the investment community. We ask that you limit yourself to 2 questions. And if you're a member of the media, please contact our media team. Before Francois begins, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks may include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information, please see the reports filed by TC Energy with Canadian Securities Regulators and with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. Finally, during the presentation, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP measures that may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures are used to provide additional information on TC Energy's operating performance, liquidity, and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. A reconciliation of various GAAP and non-GAAP measures is contained in the appendix of the presentation. With that I'll pass the call to Francois. Francois Poirier Thanks Gavin, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into our results, I just want to acknowledge the natural disasters that have impacted individuals and communities across our footprint, from Hurricane Beryl in Texas to the current devastation being caused by the Alberta and B.C. wildfires, our thoughts remain with those affected.  󰍉 TRP 󰍝  3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 1/17

During these events, our teams faced the monumental task of keeping our operations running smoothly, and their dedication to maintaining safe and reliable operations is nothing short of extraordinary. It's this dedication across our company that drove another strong quarter, while making exceptional progress on our strategic priorities for 2024. Our continued focus on safety and operational excellence allowed us to set multiple records, while growing comparable EBITDA by 9% as compared to the second quarter of 2023. We also advanced multiple strategic initiatives aimed at maximizing the long-term value of our assets, including a successful shareholder vote on South Bow and reaching unanimous support from customers for a 5-year settlement agreement on our NGTL system. Our secured capital program continues to track both cost and schedule with our major projects, Southeast Gateway and our Bruce Power Unit 3 MCR. We've already placed $1.2 billion of projects into service and remain on track to place approximately $7 billion of assets into service in 2024 including Coastal Gaslink. And as we look at 2025, this represents an important inflection point for TC Energy, with plans to place an additional $9 billion of assets into service at an average build multiple of just over 7x. In combination with our announced asset divestitures that now total $2.6 billion, strong year-to-date EBITDA performance and capital expenditures that are trending to the low end of our $8 billion to $8.5 billion outlook. We are well on track to reach our 2024 year-end debt to EBITDA target of 4.75x. We're proud to announce we've entered into Canada's largest ever indigenous equity ownership agreement, that will enable ownership of the NGTL and Foothill Systems. This historic agreement made possible by an equity loan guarantee provided by the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation in support of a newly formed Indigenous Owned Investment Partnership. The transaction creates a pathway for equity participation ownership, that delivers long term, low risk and stable revenue for local indigenous communities, creating a lasting and meaningful legacy. We thank all rights holders and stakeholders involved in making this agreement possible. It is an example of what's achievable. Well, when indigenous communities, governments and industry come together. Never have I seen a strong prospects for North American natural gas demand growth. We are seeing natural gas demand reach record highs, and this is expected to grow nearly 40 Bcf per day, 2035. The outlook for our business has never been stronger. Our assets are strategically positioned to meet growth and demand underpinned by 5 key pillars that give us visibility to attractive in-corridor opportunities through the end of the decade. Based on capacity projects under various stages of development, we have line of sight 5 plus Bcf per day of Next Wave LNG growth that will feed exports from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. And we are the only company to have major assets in all 3 markets. In the U.S., we are delivering approximately 30% of LNG feed gas. In Mexico, we expect to see the first LNG cargo this month from Altamira's liquefaction facility. And in Canada, CGL remains ready to deliver gas when called for. Second, we're seeing continued demand and reliability requirements from our utility customers. We have one of the largest natural gas storage systems in North America, and that further bolsters energy reliability across the continent. Third, power generation demand is expected to increase significantly, driven by wide scale electrification, coal- fired retirements as well as emerging power needs from AI and data centers. As an example, we see around 300 data centers at various stages of development, 60% of which have proposed locations within 15 miles of our systems, namely Columbia. Additionally within 15 miles of our Columbia and ANR systems, we estimate approximately 9 gigawatts of coal-fired generation is set to retire by 2031. From a capacity project standpoint, these drivers represent approximately an additional 5 Bcf per day of high-quality opportunity. Fourth, our assets strategically connect the lowest cost supply to the highest value markets. These basins continue to see significant growth potential, and our customers continue to look for additional connectivity. And finally, we have approximately $7.5 billion in our secured capital table for recoverable maintenance and our 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 2/17

modernization projects, that support the safe and reliable delivery of record volumes. Our role is to execute the opportunities that maximize risk adjusted returns while adhering to our net capital expenditure limit of $6 billion to $7 billion per year to create incremental value for our shareholders. In Mexico, we achieved critical milestones the construction of Southeast Gateway and remain on track for commercial in service by mid-2025 at our expected cost of us, $4.5 billion. Progress on the offshore pipe installation has reached over 98% completion. The deepwater offshore section is now installed, and there is approximately 3 kilometers of shallow water installation remaining. We anticipate the shallow water installation to be complete in the third quarter. On shore, we have completed construction at all 3 landfall sites, and construction of the onshore facilities and final pipe, as well as the tie in activities continue to progress on schedule. To further illustrate the continued demand for natural gas, again continued high utilization our systems. You can see on this slide that our NGTL system in Canada, our U.S. natural gas pipelines and our Mexico pipelines all set new all-time records for receipt or delivery volume, with several daily records achieved in July. We reached unanimous support from customers for a 5-year negotiated revenue requirement settlement on NGTL that extends from 2025 to 2029. This continues our 20 plus year track record of collaboratively working with our customers to address evolving needs while maximizing the value of our assets. The settlement is expected to resolve in approximately $150 million to $200 million per year of incremental EBITDA through increased depreciation rates and incentive mechanisms. The settlement supports competitive tolls for our customers and it incentivizes emissions reductions. The settlement also enables an investment framework to allocate approximately $3.3 billion toward a new multi-year growth program that will serve continued growth from the Western Canadian basin. The projects comprising the growth plan have targeted in service dates between 2027 and 2030 aligning with our net annual capital expenditure limit. In our Power segment, Bruce Power continues to reliably provide emission less low-cost electricity in Ontario. We achieved 78% availability in the second quarter, taking into account planned outages on 4 of our units, Units 8 through 5. The availability outlook for 2024 remains in the low 90% range, now that all planned maintenance is complete for 2024. Unit 3 MCR continues to progress on plan for both cost and schedule, and the Unit 4 MCR is expected to begin in early 2025. In the liquids business Keystone continued its strong operational performance, achieving 94% reliability in the second quarter. At our annual and special meeting in June, we received strong support from our shareholders to spinoff the liquids pipelines business with voted common shares at 97% in favor of the spin. We continue to believe that spinning off South Bow will allow both companies to execute their focused strategies while maximizing the value of their respective assets. And now I'll turn the call over to Sean. Sean O'Donnell Thanks, Francois. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that TC's comparable EBITDA grew by 9% this quarter. I'll touch on the growth highlights with the chart on the left. Canada Gas saw increases primarily from system expansions on NGTL and Foothills. U.S. Gas placed a number of new pipeline and modernization projects into service, and they signed new contracts on ANR and Great Lakes. In Mexico, the main drivers were a new lateral section of Villa de Reyes going into service last September, and higher equity earnings at Sur de Texas, primarily from the strengthening dollar over the peso. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 3/17

Page 4
Power and Energy Solution saw higher contributions from U.S. marketing and Canadian Power, which combined to offset reduced contributions from Bruce Power, which had units in planned outages last quarter, as Francois mentioned. Our Liquid segment was lower in the second quarter from the anticipated impacts of additional WCSB egress coming online and lower contributions from Liquid marketing activity, some of which we expect to reverse later in the year. Moving to the chart on the right, our comparable earnings of $978 million were slightly lower than the second quarter of 2023. There are some variances here worth spending a moment on. AFUDC was higher due to the increased capital spending on Southeast Gateway, the FX Delta was driven by a peso that strengthened by 5% in the second quarter of '23, which was an FX derivative gain for us, but then pivoted sharply to weaken by 10% last quarter, creating an FX derivative loss. As a reminder, we do hedge our FX, which flows through this line item. For an overall net income perspective, we're generally insulated from fluctuations of the U.S. peso and dollar movement. Income Taxes decreased by $59 million in the quarter, in large part due to the peso FX delta, I just mentioned. Lastly, this quarter's deduction for non-controlling interest increased primarily due to the sale of the 40% interest in Columbia that closed in the fourth quarter last year. To conclude, our earnings update, our 2024 earnings outlook is consistent with the outlook in our 2023 annual report, and that our earnings per common share are expected to be lower this year than in 2023, driven largely by the NCI adjustments from our ongoing asset divestiture program. Turning to Page 15 and continuing with our 2024 outlook. Due to our continued strong performance year-to-date and out for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our 2024 comparable EBITDA target of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion. This year's growth is driven by the full year impact of our 2023 project completions and cash flow from our $7 billion worth of projects going into service this year. A quick reminder is that we continue to include Liquids in our aggregate guidance until the spinoff closes. And the trend is similar for Liquids, following a very strong first quarter, our Liquids performance continues to track its 2024 outlook. On the right side of the page, I wanted to echo Francois' comment that we're marking meaningful progress on our deleveraging plan and are on track to achieve our 4.75x leverage target by the end of this year. Each component of our deleveraging strategy is contributing to our success. Our corporate development team has signed up $2.6 billion of asset sales, a very attractive multiples, and were only in July. That pace makes us feel comfortable about our $3 billion program target by year end. Our Natural Gas and Power teams are collectively bringing $7 billion of new capacity and associated EBITDA online this year. And our third lever is CapEx savings that Francois mentioned. Our project delivery organization is tracking towards the low end of our $8 billion to $8.5 billion net CapEx target for the year. Every dollar of CapEx savings contributes to immediate deleveraging and can also be viewed as $1 for $1 offset to our asset sale target. So our project delivery team deserves a special shout out this quarter for delivering on our EBITDA and trending very well on our net CapEx target for the year. And finally, it bears repeating, we remain committed to staying within our $6 billion to $7 billion annual net CapEx budget in 2025 and beyond with the bias towards the lower end of that range. On Page 16, we provide a quick update of our expected timeline to close the spin transaction. Practically speaking, the most efficient closing date from an IT and financial reporting perspective, would be the first day of the new fiscal quarter, which would be October 1st. That is our early target as we begin to think dry run and processes over the next 2 months. So we are refining our target closing window, to say early fourth quarter. The only external milestone remaining to close the transaction is raising South Bow $7.9 billion capital 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 4/17

structure. We have been supporting Bevin and [ Van's ] finance team in South Bow, who are preparing for the financing this quarter. I'd offer a few quick comments on market tone, on ahead of South Bow's inaugural issuance. The fixed income markets remain robust, particularly for ingress investment grade companies with a mix of long-term commercial contract portfolio and low risk growth like South Bow. For context, TC completed the largest ever Canadian bond deal at $7 billion for Coastal Gaslink, recently. To give you a sense for the market depth in Canada, this deal was nearly twice the size of the next largest deal in history, and we were 3x oversubscribed and tighten our credits spread considerable from lunch to close. CGL had terrific execution on largely a Canadian offering, whereas South Bow will have the benefit of being able to raise capital in both the U.S. and Canada that dual market access should provide strong liquidity and pricing leverage to the transaction. I'll conclude this slide with 2 key model data points. TC will repay debt with the proceeds from the South Bow offering, and shareholders who continue to hold their pro forma TC and South Bow shares are expected to be kept whole on a dividend per share basis going forward. On Page 17, we reflect on over 2 decades of continuous EBITDA and dividend growth that TC has delivered. We're cognizant of how important these metrics are to the long-standing shareholder value proposition we're committed to delivering. With that I'm happy to report the TC's Board of Directors, declared a third quarter, dividend of $0.96 per common share. On an annualized basis that implies a dividend yield of approximately 6.6% as of Monday's close. I wanted to conclude my section this morning with Page 18 and let our investors know that we just released our 2024 report on sustainability. It's a fantastic report that provides a comprehensive overview of our sustainability performance and progress, including highlights such as how TC has reduced absolute methane emissions by 15% while supporting customer growth and increasing our own cash flow. Now we're investing billions into the communities where we operate and how TC is building a diverse leadership team today and training tomorrow's future talent. You can read more about these 3 vital efforts and many more in the report on our website. With that, I will pass the call back to Francois. Francois Poirier Thanks, Sean. Once again, our team's dedication to maintaining safe and reliable operations to meet growing energy demand allowed us to deliver another strong quarter. The steady progress we're making against our 2024 priorities, combined with an exceptional outlook for our business has made me very excited about our future. Our focus for the remainder of the year remains clear and has not changed or waivered in the last 18 months. First, we'll continue to maximize the value of our assets through safety and operational excellence. Second, project execution has been exceptional with critical milestones reached on Southeast Gateway, and we remain focused on delivering on time and on budget. Third, with the strong year-to-date results and with the majority of our $3 billion asset divestiture plan now announced, we've made significant progress towards achieving our 2024 deleveraging target. Thank you for your attention. And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 5/17

Praneeth Satish So a lot of positive developments here. Recently, you've done about $2.6 billion of asset sales, NGTL settlement, which adds $175 million of EBITDA, hundreds of millions of CapEx savings versus the budget and on track to get Southeast Gateway into service early. So I guess the question is, when you put all of that together, where do you see leverage shaking out in 2025 versus the 4.75% target? Because it would seem to us that you're pretty close. Francois Poirier Praneeth, it's Francois. Thanks for that excellent summary of our prepared remarks. Look, we -- with the $2.6 billion of asset sales announced and expected to close here in the third quarter in aggregate and the strong EBITDA performance and trending to the lower end of the CapEx guidance range at $8 billion, we're largely done with being below 4.75 for 2024. Of course, we're all aware of the fact that we only have a partial year benefit in 2025 of the assets going into service and that in 2026, frankly, we are largely done as well. So the question is how do you deal with that interim 2025. As I said before, there are 3 levers for us to lean on to address the credit metrics in 2025. The first is continue to improve and exceed plan on our EBITDA performance. That comes from safe and excellent operations. The second is to outperform our plan on the capital spend, which we are optimistic there will be opportunities for us to do that. And then thirdly, our additional divestitures. We do still have some transactions in market. Now that we have the luxury of essentially being complete for the 2024 program, to the extent we see attractive valuations, we may consider announcing additional transactions in the second half of 2024. But again, I'll underscore that it will have to be compelling valuations. I think all 3 of those levers are available to us, and we're very confident in our ability between all 3 of those levers to address that as interim or partial year in 2025. Praneeth Satish And then maybe on your asset sale comments here. So you've established a framework now for selling a minority stake in NGTL to indigenous communities. Does this -- the first question is, does this suggest a template for similar transactions in the future? And then if the answer is yes, does this transaction basically set a floor multiple of 12x for future asset sale valuation? So in other words, if you've got this ability to sell additional interest in NGTL at roughly a 12x valuation, does that become the hurdle rate for future asset sale valuations? Francois Poirier So I guess I would say the answer is yes, but it would be asset dependent, right? I mean valuations of different asset classes with different risk profiles will vary. Clearly, NGTL being full cost of service regulation has the lowest volatility of cash flows. And so we'll garner a very attractive valuation as we saw with the transaction we announced a couple of days ago. The backdrop is very positive for M&A right now. We've got good fund flows back into core infrastructure funds. We've got monetary policy easing in Canada already and soon to be easing is our expectation in the U.S. And there is, again, strong demand for natural gas infrastructure from private buyers, given all of the encouraging 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 6/17

Page 7
dynamics around natural gas demand growth. So all 3 of those things point to a continued and very robust market. And again, adjusting for which asset we might be looking to monetize next, I think we can continue to see fairly robust multiples. Operator The next question is from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen Can you walk us through the EBITDA uplift for the NGTL settlement in more detail? And strategically, what does it mean for you to have the indigenous communities as part owners of this asset going forward? Stanley Chapman This is Stan. I can take the first part with respect to the NGTL settlement and maybe I'll just back up and give you a more holistic view on that. We're really excited about the collaborative effort with our customers for the first time in recent memory. This is -- we had unanimous support for the settlement, and that's really a special thing for us. And the settlement will make sure that the customers maintain competitive tolls and the new market access that they need. And for us, it's going to mean improved cash flow and a stronger balance sheet. So I simply think of the settlement as having 2 parts. With respect to the tolls, a 5-year term that will extend through December 2029, we're maintaining the 10.1% return on equity on a 40% equity thickness. And this increase of EBITDA that we've talked about of around $200 million really comes in 2 parts. About $150 million of that will be generated predominantly through the accelerated return of capital via higher depreciation rates. And another $50 million or so will be generated through incentive mechanisms, as those incentive mechanisms are earned on a year-to-year basis. You can also think of the $150 million of increased depreciation as largely being included in our plan. With the $50 million in incentives or so representing additional upside, again, as those incentives are realized going forward. And the second part of the settlement deals with the multiyear build-out. The build-out is designed to meet the growing system demand. And when completed, will increase capacity by about 1 Bcf a day. So consistent with our $6 billion CapEx plan for 2025 forward and consistent with what we've included in prior Investor Day materials, and we're going to allocate about $3.27 billion of capital that primarily will be spent across 2026 through 2030. So you can think of that as roughly about $0.5 billion a year. And that capital will fund a series of projects, each of which are formidable, constructible in-corridor projects that will be subject to a final investment decision when they get to a Class III estimate. Francois Poirier And Theresa, in terms of what it means to have indigenous partners. First of all, this is a business transaction that's separate and apart from the rights that indigenous communities as rights holders have to participate in our regulatory processes. Having said that, as our partners, we're going to be sharing with them much earlier than would otherwise be the case, our development plans and our projects. And we'll be able to receive their input into exactly how we design and execute our projects. That is nothing but a good thing in terms of building support for the projects as we advance them through the regulatory phase and just builds a much stronger alignment between us and a key rights holder in our regulatory process. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 7/17

Theresa Chen Turning to the Mexico side of things. So from here, what are the key gating factors and your real hurdles related to execution on the Southeast Gateway and getting that asset online and on time and on budget. And then on the heels of the Mexico presidential election with the U.S. presidential election around the corner, how do you see the political landscape evolving? And what potential read through do you see to your assessing business in Mexico as time goes on? Sean O'Donnell Yes. Theresa, I could talk to you first about the project, and then I'll turn it over to Francois to talk about the political climate. But again, just to reinforce, no change to the project's cost estimate, $4.5 billion or to our summer 2025 in-service date. We are glad that we've gotten all of the deepwater pipeline done, and we have about 3 kilometers of nearshore work to get done, which we think will be completed by sometime in the third quarter. So progress on that work is progressing nicely. At the same time, we're working to complete the onshore work related to our pipe and compressor stations, and we have the expectation of that being mechanically complete sometime around year-end. CFE is continuing to make really good progress with the construction of their power plants, which are ready to go in service sometime around Q4 of this year and then another one early in 2025. And I was down in Mexico just a few weeks ago, and they again reinforced the need of gas from SGP to fuel these plants going forward. Our team is really laser-focused on getting the project placed in service on time and on budget as safely and efficiently as possible. And right now, we're in a really, really good position to do that. We have had initial discussions around what would need to be true for early in service to take hold, but haven't landed anything definitive just yet. So if you give us a little more time to finish out some of the offshore work and those discussions, we'll get back to you thereafter. Francois Poirier And Theresa, as to the political landscape, President-elect Sheinbaum being elected was not a surprise to us. We see a continuation of supportive policy for natural gas transmission. Again, we were the first ever partnership formed with the CFE, with a private sector party. The President-elect has made very supportive statements publicly with respect to natural gas transmission being important to achieving their socioeconomic goals and has also made very supportive comments with respect to the project. We have continued to see excellent support from the staff at the CFE to advance all of the development aspects of the project throughout construction. And with respect to the pending election in the United States, we will see how those unfold. Our perspective is that adding egress for U.S. natural gas from the Gulf Coast into Mexico as a market to compete with LNG exports is a little bit agnostic to which party forms government after the election. That's one of the benefits of adhering to our natural gas strategy and principles. And so we view the outcome of the election in the U.S. not having any kind of significant impact on our prospects for our business in Mexico. Operator The next question is from Ben Pham with BMO. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 8/17

Page 9
Benjamin Pham I'm with [indiscernible]. What are your next focus on with respect to rate filings? And is there anything across your network where you can also reflect depreciation rates and bring forward cash flows? Stanley Chapman Well, as part of the NGTL settlement we're doing exactly that by increasing depreciation to the tune of around $150 million. And amongst other things, that's going to allow us the ability to potentially redeploy that in other jurisdictions where we can get higher returns for that capital investment. Any other rate cases, we have about 70% of our revenues in the U.S. come from Colombia and the ANR pipeline systems. On Columbia's last settlement, we have an obligation to file for new rates to be effective no earlier than April of 2025 and no later than April 2026. So our team is working through that right now. And on the ANR rate case, you could think of that as likely to take effect -- the rates to take effect sometime end of this year or early in 2026. Those are the next 2 biggest opportunities in terms of filings. I will note that, particularly in the U.S., we have a long-standing history of settling rate cases, and we are really close to, if not at the doorstep of settling the ongoing rate cases that we've had on the GTN system and both the Northern Border system. So more good news to come there. Benjamin Pham And then maybe just to go back to my -- the question on the depreciation. Is that going to be more limited to the Canadian side then? Stanley Chapman Yes. For the most part, yes. The mainline system has a settlement that's in FX for another 2.5 years, and that system is already highly depreciated. So there's probably not a lot more to get out of it. But with respect to the U.S., we'll look to other optimization paradigms with respect to our rate case filings. Benjamin Pham And maybe the second one on the data opportunity you mentioned in mileage and location. Are you able to [indiscernible] the CapEx opportunity for that? I mean 15 miles of steel, I mean, that's -- is that more of a $0.5 billion opportunity [indiscernible] for each data center? Stanley Chapman Obviously, each project is unique. But when you think just an average rule of thumb, somewhere maybe $5 million to $10 million a mile may be something that you could use. So we're talking well below $0.5 billion and a couple of hundred million dollars. But again, all things equal depends upon the specifics of the projects.

The next question is from Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan I just want to confirm some things, Stan, you mentioned just around the NGTL settlement. So is the $150 million of increased depreciation is something that was already incorporated in the guidance you gave at the November 2023 Investor Day just in terms of future EBITDA? And then on the incentives, I just want to make sure that, that $50 million, is that additive to the incentive framework that was already in place? Stanley Chapman So yes, to the first part of your question, the $150 million of increased depreciation was largely baked into our existing plan. And then you could think of the incremental upside is being recovered through the incentive mechanisms. Now there's no cap on the incentive dollars. The mechanism is very similar to what it was last time and that there's 2 different tiers that will go through. Tier 1 has a 50-50 sharing, Tier 2 and 80-20 sharing. But when we look at things, we think that there is a reasonable expectation that we should be able to generate around $50 million or so of these incentive earnings going forward, and that would be incremental to plan. Robert Kwan Yes. So is that -- sorry, is that incremental to what you have already been earning on the system? Stanley Chapman Correct. Robert Kwan Just a final one here. Strategically, Francois, you've talked a lot about your payout ratio strategy. And then overall, I think trying to get that down over time to screen favorably against regulated utilities. So this is really more the earnings payout ratio. Can you just talk a little bit more about how you're feeling about that and how you expect to kind of achieve that and possibly over what time frame? Francois Poirier Yes. That's an ambition we have, I would say, to start focusing on in the second half of the decade. Right now, we have -- we're laser focused on one very important task, and that's to put $16 billion of assets into service between 2024 and 2025. As I talked about with respect to one of the prior questions, we may have an opportunity or we may decide to accelerate some additional divestitures here in the second half of 2024 to make further progress against our 2025 leverage metrics. So what I would say is I would rather get that work done and see where we fall out on what our go-forward run rate leverage and payout ratios post all of these transactions and these assets be put into service before we start giving you a little bit of visibility around what we might be looking to do with incremental free cash flow and the impact on payout ratios going forward. But as you said, the trend over the long run is for us to be looking to 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 10/17

reduce our payout ratios, both from a distributable cash flow per share as well as earnings per share going forward. Operator The next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Unknown Analyst This is [ Ratan Reddy ] on for Jeremy. On the data center opportunity specifically, could you elaborate, I guess, on how you see opportunities in Canada specifically? And maybe how that compares to what you're seeing in the U.S.? Stanley Chapman Sure. I could do that for you. Big picture-wise, there's somewhere around 8,000 data centers that are operating in the world today. About 1/3 of them are located in the U.S. and a majority of those are located in Virginia. As we sit here today, there is around 300 or so data centers that are currently under construction or contemplated in the U.S. And when you look at where they're being built, more than 60% of them are being built within 50 miles of our pipes, which really uniquely situates us to compete for and win this load. If you think of an average data center as consuming about 150 megawatts of power, which is about enough of power to fuel 77,000 homes, by the way. These 300 new data centers are going to need somewhere around 45 to 50 gigawatts of power to operate. And then if you apply just an average heat rate to that, that's how we get this notion of around 6 to 8 Bcf a day of capacity that's going to be needed to serve them. So in our discussions with various entities, what we're learning is that while power costs represent a relatively small portion of the overall cost to operate a data center, the access to reliable power could be a roadblock towards the timely build-out. Given that, we're seeing a shift in siding preferences from regions where big telecom infrastructure is in place to regions where energy and supply infrastructure is in place. And as an alternative to citing these data centers behind LDCs, we're now seeing a much greater potential for data center operators to seek laterals off of our mainline and to use that gas supply to fuel on-site power generation that they would build and/or own themselves. So in the U.S., we tend to build projects at around a 6x to 8x build multiple, and I would expect that to continue going forward with respect to data center opportunities. The other part of your question is actually very good actually in that our best-in-class footprint doesn't limit the opportunity set just to the U.S. In Canada, there's around 300 data centers that are in operation today. We could see that load increasing by 1 to 2 gigawatts before the end of the decade. In Mexico, there's about 150 data centers in operation today. Most notably, in the state of Queretaro, it's ranked 13th in terms of data center demand usage currently and 2 of our pipelines, Villa de Reyes and the Tamazunchale pipeline serve the state of Queretaro. So there's opportunities for expansion there. So while entities like Google and Amazon and Microsoft are all talking about expansion plans across all 3 of the geographies, I think the last thing I would leave you with is, while data centers are a unique opportunity and we're going to pursue them. Our portfolio effect is much more than that and that we have growth opportunities with respect to the next wave of LNG with respect to LDC reliability, with respect to growing power generation and electrification as well as supply access in addition to the data center opportunity. 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 11/17

Unknown Analyst For the second one, I just want to ask, I guess, on how you guys are progressing towards those productivity and cost effectiveness initiatives you guys laid out within the last year? Stanley Chapman Yes. I think you're talking about what we called our focus project, which is around fundamentally changing the way we do our work on safety, productivity and capital. And what we mentioned to you previously was we set a target of $750 million of synergy savings by 2025. At this point in time, we are well on our way to meeting that goal, having generated somewhere around $410 million of synergies as of last month, and look to get the balance taken down in the next year. Potentially maybe come in a little ahead of our schedule there. Operator The next question is from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley Curious, once as you're getting towards completion of Southeast Gateway, how you think about growth in Mexico within your $6 billion to $7 billion per year CapEx budget? Are there material new opportunities you could pursue in the country? Or is it more likely smaller scale opportunities? Francois Poirier It's Francois. First and foremost, we're very bullish on the role that Mexico is going to play in North American gas markets, both in terms of growing demand in country, but also the potential for LNG exports from Mexico. So that will drive additional investment opportunities for us to consider. I would -- I always believe that it's important for you to be the incumbent that builds the backbone of the infrastructure. That's what we're doing right now with completion of Villa de Reyes as well as Southeast Gateway. And from that comes very attractive, low build multiple low-risk ancillary lateral opportunities that tend to come your way as the incumbent. We are starting to see a number of those opportunities present themselves. But as we said, we are also focused on managing our aggregate exposure from Mexico as a percentage of the whole and pro forma for the spin and Southeast Gateway going into service, we will be at approximately 15% of consolidated EBITDA. And prior to contemplating any additional investment in the near term, we would need to see some progress in either bringing in a joint venture partner or growing ahead of plan or other franchises such that the percentage is lowered. But again, the backdrop -- the macro backdrop around demand growth will present us with more investment opportunities in the future, albeit a bit smaller. Keith Stanley And curious if there's anything notable to update on the Coastal GasLink litigation. I think there were a couple of settlements that came through. Does that all going according to your expectations? And any meaningful cash inflows or outflows you're expecting as part of that? 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 12/17

Page 13
Stanley Chapman Yes. This is Stan. With respect to CGL, we continue to work on the post construction reclamation activities, which we should have completed by the end of this year. We did have one settlement with respect to cost recoveries. We're going to -- continue to pursue the other and really no change in our guidance that at the end of the day, we expect to be in a net recovery position. Operator The next question is from Robert Catellier with CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier Congratulations on the progress towards your deleveraging goals. A follow-up questions there. I just wanted to follow up on how the U.S. $400 million verdict in the Columbia acquisition case impacts your deleveraging plan? And then I'll have a follow-up question. Francois Poirier So we, I think have publicly disclosed our intention to appeal the court's decision. We expect that the adjudication of the appeal process will run well into 2025. And we will react accordingly and again, our plans, we're able to accommodate any judgment or a cash outlay that is required at the end of that process and continue to meet all of our objectives around deleveraging. We are also optimistic based on the merits of the case that we will get a different outcome based on appeal. Robert Catellier So how is the $400 million treated though, currently until there's a final verdict? Does it increase your burden? Or is it treated as a contingency that doesn't add to the leverage? Stanley Chapman We do not have an accrual for that, Rob, in our plan. It's just based on confidence in legal review, Rob. But we'll know in the end of the first quarter. Robert Catellier And then on a more positive note here, just given the substantial progress you've made with SGP, I think I heard Stan mention the potential for being mechanically complete late in '24 possibly having an early sort of state. How does that change your approach to deleveraging? And do you have any insight as to how the rating agencies would view early mechanical completion in terms of how they treat the partial year of 2025. Francois Poirier 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 13/17

Page 14
So I'll start, Robert, and then I'll pass it over to Sean to comment on rating agencies. As we said before, we feel like we've got our goals achieved around achieving an upper limit of 4.75 debt-to-EBITDA for 2024. So now we're looking to deal with the partial year of 2025. We've got 3 levers to pull to deal with that partial year. First is executing on our capital projects under budget. The second is having EBITDA performance that is ahead of plan. And one of the potential ways to do that is to bring assets into service early. Our plan right now has Southeast Gateway coming into service approximately in midyear. As Stan mentioned, to the extent we're contemplating what's the art of the possible for bringing that asset into service early, it's very early days in our conversations with the CFE. Our job, first and foremost, is to excel on the execution so that we have the option of having that conversation with our customer. And so we're making good progress on that. And then Sean, as to the rating agencies and how they would view that. Sean O'Donnell We have given the rating agencies, the conservative contractual update. The project is moving on schedule. EBITDA is a midyear, right? And you will have seen all 3 agencies reaffirm TC, right, family-wide and that was a major update in focal point, as you can imagine for each of them, so. And a rule of thumb, we've done this before, but round numbers, CAD 800 million worth of EBITDA and SGP. If you annualize that, that's an extra 400, that's our 2025 gap, is that half year. So there's -- as Francois said, a lot of focus on seeing what the art of the possible is commercially to help a customer and help ourselves along the way next year. Robert Catellier Just last question for me. Just on the storage, one of your competitors reported today and has indicated they're seeing both term and higher rates on their storage renewals. I wonder if you can give us an outlook for how you see the commercial development of your storage assets, understanding you might have more of that rate base? Stanley Chapman So we are one of the largest storage owner operators in North America and see tremendous value in storage across our systems. And in the aggregate across all of TC Energy, we operate around 650 Bcf, which is about 532 Bcf that being here in the U.S. We're in our eighth consecutive year of having our storage capacity 100% contracted for. So really strong demand continues. And our storage is heavily weighted in the market area, and over 80% of our storage is subscribed by our LDC customers who really rely on it as a source of reliability to make sure that they're meeting their peak day needs. So we don't see that changing going forward. Any storage that we seek to develop will be along those lines of rate regulated, integrated into our systems to provide additional reliability to our LDC customers. Operator The next question is from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. John Mackay 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 14/17

Page 15
I wanted to maybe just go back to the NGTL piece and the commentary around kind of adding 1 Bcf a day of capacity through the back of the decade. I guess, is there room -- I guess, first question is, is that incremental to kind of existing expected growth in the system? And then 2, kind of is that locked in? Or is there upside there? Just how to think about that kind of piece from a capacity standpoint? Stanley Chapman That 1 Bcf represents the expected incremental growth that's to come over the next 5 to 7 years or so. Again, the project is made up of a series of smaller bite-size expansion projects and should we see -- or should the customers see changes in market needs over the next several years, we have the ability to tweak those projects accordingly. John Mackay Maybe staying up there but pivoting to sear the Cedar extension. You guys have talked about working on CGL to kind of improve those returns that to you understand this is a pretty small dollar amount versus the kind of $1.2 billion of overall project capital. But can you talk about how this might end up looking like from a return standpoint on that pipe? And maybe just next steps to get into potential Phase 2 expansion of the mainline? Stanley Chapman Yes. With respect to Cedar, we were very pleased to see the [indiscernible] announced their FID last month, and we have indeed started construction on the project. Think of it as having a P50 capital cost of about $1.2 billion, which will increase capacity by the $400,000 a day when it's in service in 2028. With respect to the project's returns on an after-tax unlevered basis, you can think of it as having basically a modest upside to our regulated Canadian businesses with further upside potential if we deliver the project at a lower capital cost. On Phase 2 of CGL, really no new updates. We've continued to progress work related to the project scope, the time line engineering assessments. And to assess this expansion, including discussions about how we could further derisk the project execution should it ultimately reach FID. Operator The next question is from Zack Van Everen with TPH. Zackery Van Everen Just going back to the U.S. power demand side of things, understanding that even laterals with the FERC environment can take a few years to plan, develop and build. Do you guys have existing space on your system today that can kind of act as operating leverage as power demand grows in the near term? Stanley Chapman So it really depends where the opportunity arises, but most of the power gen growth that we're seeing is along the Columbia and ANR systems. For the most part, there are isolated capacity pockets that we could use to 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 15/17

Page 16
incorporate into a project. But in many instances, it's going to require looping and/or compression to capture these loads. Zackery Van Everen And then maybe one on the CGL with LNG Canada Phase 2. Can you remind us of what that project consists of it, mainly just additional compressor stations? Stanley Chapman Yes. The project -- essentially is that it's a conditioning compressor station that's going to provide the additional capacity going forward. I think it's 1 station, 3 different units, if I'm not there are 5 different units. Operator The next question is from Patrick Kenny with National Bank Financial. Patrick Kenny Just back to the rise in natural gas demand here across North America. I think, Francois, you mentioned 40 Bcf a day incremental by 2035. Yet it already appears that we're seeing relatively full storage capacity in several markets, which is good for spreads, of course, but perhaps can you just comment on the need for adding additional storage capacity on both sides of the border over the coming years to help enable this higher demand profile? Francois Poirier I think what we're seeing right now, particularly in the U.S., is the need for additional storage, particularly in the Gulf Coast to handle balancing opportunities associated with LNG. And again, that tends to be not physically integrated into our systems, and it tends to have a degree of merchant risk or shorter-term contracting that comes with it. And for us, we're going to get back to ensuring anything we do around the storage assets are going to be integrated, so we can provide better services to our LDC customers in particular. Same thing with respect to Canada and the word situation right now where we have a low pricing environment. Our storage capacity is roughly 80% full, which is above the 5-year average for this time. And to the extent that there are opportunities to use stores to help balance arbitrage, either with respect to weather or price, we'll look to take advantage of those. But I don't really see us doing a whole lot of new storage development going forward. Anything we do likely will be in the U.S. and again, integrated back into our customer mix. Patrick Kenny And then just maybe on the power demand side, I know it's still early days that you see. But wondering if you had just an update on how the impact assessment process is going? Or any other developments related to the potential timing of the project? 3/1/25, 2:56 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1887718587&ts=3238118&ref=l6cin7 16/17

Page 17
Annesley Wallace It's Annesley here. So Bruce Power continues really to be primarily focused on continued operational excellence and the life extension of the existing fleet. As you've highlighted, the impact assessment process has started for potential new build at the site, Bruce C. It is still very early days for that project. And so while we are happy to see there's extremely strong support for new nuclear in the province, and we are happy to participate in that process. It will be years before we will end up at the completion of even just the impact assessment stage. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. If there are any further questions, please contact investorrelations@tcenergy. I will now hand the call back over to Gavin Wylie. Please go ahead, Mr. Wylie. Gavin Wylie Well, thanks very much.

Thanks, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on a clear set of priorities for 2024 that includes safety, operational excellence and project execution has again delivered strong operational and financial results. In the third quarter, comparable EBITDA is up 6% compared to the third quarter of last year. This positions us extremely well for the rest of 2024, where we now expect comparable EBITDA to be at the upper end of the range of our full year outlook. We've advanced multiple strategic initiatives aimed at maximizing the long-term value of our assets, including successfully completing the spin-off of our Liquids Pipelines business into South Bow on October 1. I'd like to take a moment to recognize our teams for the months of dedication, focus and collaboration from every corner of our organization to make this milestone possible. This marks the beginning of a new era for TC Energy, and I'm excited to share with you our renewed vision at our upcoming Investor Day on November 19. Next, our focus on project execution is delivering meaningful results. We're making significant progress on our major projects, including Bruce Power Unit 3 MCR and Southeast Gateway, which I'll discuss in more detail on the next slide. We've placed $1.2 billion of projects in-service year-to-date and expect to place approximately $7 billion of assets into service in 2024, which includes Coastal GasLink, with another $8.5 billion coming online in 2025. Now given our strong project execution and optimization efforts, we now expect 2024 net capital expenditures to be between $7.4 billion and $7.7 billion, which represents a midpoint reduction of approximately 8% versus our initial outlook of $8 billion to $8.5 billion, further enhancing our financial strength and flexibility. In combination with our strong year-to-date EBITDA performance, our revised outlook for capital expenditures and completed asset sales in 2024 totaling $1.6 billion, we are on track to achieve our year-end debt-to-EBITDA target of 4.75x. As to Southeast Gateway, this is our marine pipeline project that will supply up to 1.3 Bcf a day of natural gas to meet the growing need for reliable and affordable energy in the Southeast region of Mexico. Importantly, our strong execution and safety record have resulted in an updated estimated capital cost for the project to be between USD 3.9 billion and USD 4.1 billion, which is approximately 11% lower than our initial cost estimate of $4.5 billion and a significant driver behind our overall reduction in our 2024 capital program. We've now achieved mechanical completion on all major onshore facilities, which includes both compressor stations as well as a delivery meter station at Paraiso. Both the deepwater and onshore pipe installation has been complete, and we've hydro-tested approximately 500 kilometers of the offshore section. Only 1.4 kilometers of shallow water pipe installation remains, and we expect to complete that work during the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate reaching mechanical completion in late 2024 or very early in 2025 and are on track to achieve our commercial in-service no later than mid-2025. Now the outlook for our business has never been stronger. Underpinned by wide-scale electrification, demand for natural gas and reliable power generation continues to reach record highs. North American natural gas will play a critical role in increasing global access to reliable and sustainable energy. Our forecast highlights North America's natural gas demand will rise by about 40 Bcf a day by 2035. And this surge in demand is driven by LNG exports, coal plant retirements, utility reliability needs and, of course, growing electricity consumption from AI and data centers. 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 2/16

Rising demand will necessitate connections to new supply and demand centers and the maintenance and modernization of existing infrastructure to ensure its ongoing safety and reliability. Collectively, this growing demand is creating an environment that is rich with opportunities for the incremental build-out of natural gas infrastructure. Now we'll be walking through these opportunities in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day on November 19. But suffice it to say, TC Energy is the only energy infrastructure company with incumbency in all 3 geographies in North America. And we believe that the strength of our base business, combined with the vast opportunity set and disciplined capital allocation, will allow us to deliver solid growth, low risk and repeatable performance. Safety and operational excellence form the foundation of everything we do at TC Energy. The third quarter was no exception. Our team's focus on these core principles combined with the demand for our vital energy assets, ensured continued high utilization and availability across our asset base including, for example, achieving 98% availability at Bruce Power. This, in turn, leads to increased year-over-year financial performance, as illustrated on this slide. We will look to maintain this positive momentum through the end of 2024, and our focus remains on achieving our strategic priorities while continuing to deliver long-term shareholder value. And now I'll turn the call over to Sean. Sean O'Donnell Thanks, Francois, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to start this morning by highlighting how the improvements in our cost optimization and project execution programs that Francois mentioned are contributing to our results this year. On the left chart, we show our original net CapEx outlook for the year of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. On our second quarter call, we highlighted that our expectation was trending towards the lower end of that range. We now expect our 2024 net CapEx to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.7 billion. This is a reduction of approximately $700 million, which creates dollar-for-dollar impact on our deleveraging, which I'll touch on in a moment. As you also heard from Francois, the largest driver of the CapEx savings is from the continued successful execution of our Southeast Gateway project, but there have also been projects and cost optimization gains across the entire portfolio. In addition to the $700 million in capital savings, we grew third quarter comparable EBITDA by 6% year-over-year. And similar to prior quarters, this year, we enjoyed contributions from across our entire asset base, as you can see on the chart to the left. Canada Gas saw higher rate base earnings from continued system expansions coming into service, on both NGTL and Foothills. U.S. gas put growth and modernization projects into service, including the Gillis Access project serving the Gulf Coast LNG markets, and the results were partially offset from the closing of the Portland Natural Gas sale in August. In Mexico, we had higher equity earnings at Sur de Texas, primarily from the strengthening U.S. dollar over the peso. As a reminder, our contracts in Mexico are U.S. dollar-denominated, but we do see impacts from peso fluctuations due to equity accounting at Sur de Texas. Our Power and Energy Solutions team saw improved contributions from Bruce Power, which achieved 98% availability in the third quarter, up from 94% a year ago. 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 3/16

Page 4
Our Liquids segment decreased primarily due to lower margins from marketing activities as a result of incremental WCSB egress capacity. Those are partially offset by higher volumes on the U.S. Gulf Coast system. Moving to the right chart. Our comparable earnings of $1.1 billion were 4% higher than the third quarter of '23. There are some variances on the right chart worth spending a moment on. Depreciation was higher, reflecting expansion facilities and new projects being placed into service. Interest expense was lower, primarily due to reduced levels of short-term borrowing and higher capitalized interest. AFUDC was higher due to continued total spending on Southeast Gateway. And lastly, this quarter's deduction for noncontrolling interest increased primarily due to the sale of the 40% interest in Columbia that closed in the fourth quarter of last year. Our 2024 earnings outlook remains consistent with the outlook in our 2023 annual report in that our earnings per common share are expected to be lower this year than in 2023 driven largely by the NCI adjustments from the asset divestiture program. Turning to Page 12. We'll provide an update on our 2024 EBITDA outlook. Our focus on safety and operational excellence have contributed to yet another quarter of exceptional asset performance. If you look at the chart on the left for 2024, comparable EBITDA is expected to be at the upper end of our $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion range. When we exclude Liquids EBITDA contribution in 2024, we expect TC's comparable EBITDA to be at the high end of our $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion range. For clarity, this is the range we expect to report in TC year-end 2024 financials when Liquids has moved to discontinued operations. On the right side of the page, I wanted to recap several of the important financial and deleveraging milestones that the team has achieved this year. We have achieved strong EBITDA performance. We've realized synergies through efficiency and integration measures. We closed on $1.6 billion in asset sales, and we have continued to improve our capital efficiency and CapEx cost optimization programs. The combined impact of these improvements to the business plan put us on track to achieve our 4.75x debt to comparable EBITDA target by the end of 2024. As we look ahead to 2025, we expect to place approximately $8.5 billion of assets in-service, which will drive EBITDA growth in the second half of 2025 and full year 2026. I'll conclude my section this morning with a reflection on how our business model has delivered repeatable growth over the last 2 decades. 2024 represents a material inflection point for TC in that we are simultaneously experiencing improved capital efficiencies, repeatable low-risk growth projects, the beginning of an organic deleveraging cycle and unprecedented increases in demand for natural gas and power on each of our systems. With our focused strategy as a natural gas and power company, we believe we have the lowest-risk business model in this sector with a growth portfolio that offers very attractive risk-adjusted returns. Given that outlook and our continued strong financial performance, TC's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.8225 per common share. This revised quarterly dividend reflects TC's proportionate allocation of the dividend pro forma for the closing of the spin-off that closed on October 1. When taken together with South Bow's intended dividend for the fourth quarter, our shareholders' combined dividends will remain whole in 2024. With that, I'll pass the call back to Francois.

Thank you, Sean. In summary, our continued focus on a clear set of priorities in 2024, including safety, operational excellence and project execution excellence, has delivered strong operational and financial results. Our focus for the rest of the year remains clear and we will continue executing against these 3 priorities. We look forward to connecting further at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish So maybe you'll touch on this at the upcoming Analyst Day, but I guess as you look across your portfolio here, all the various gas expansion opportunities. Can you maybe break down how much of the demand you're seeing from coal to gas switching versus higher demand from power plants versus behind-the-meter generation? Kind of which of those categories represents the largest piece of the demand that you're seeing? And then do you see any differences in the economics across those different types of projects? Or are they all kind of clustered in that 6 to 8x build range? Stanley Chapman Praneeth, this is Stan. I can take a stab at that. I would just say that growth across North America continues to be strong and supported by fundamentals that show that there's 40 Bcf of incremental demand between now and 2035, which brings our total gas market to about 160 Bcf. And from us, we look at that growth as coming across 5 core drivers. The first and the biggest of them all is really LNG exports, where we see a tripling of North American exports from 13 Bcf a day today to 39 Bcf a day, which is led by a more than doubling of exports in the U.S. With respect to power generation, there's lots of tailwinds across our footprint in terms of increased power demand led by coal-to-gas retirements and emerging demand from data centers. On the coal conversions, there are 9 plants within 15 miles of our pipes that are set to retire by 2031, and we think that could be an extra Bcf a day load for us. When we look at the 300-or-so data centers that are currently being contemplated across the U.S., 200 of those are located within 50 miles of our pipe, and we're currently in negotiations with various entities for up to 2 Bcf a day of that load, and I expect us to compete for and win our fair share. And we're also focusing on opportunities around LDC reliability, which could be another 1 to 2 Bcf, as well as supply access to make sure that producers have export capacity out of constrained market areas. And then lastly, we're going to continue to invest in modernization and maintenance capital expenditures across our systems. So big picture-wise, when I add all that up, I see about 13 Bcf a day of growth opportunities that are in various stages of execution, development or origination. And in this target-rich environment, I don't think we're going to have any problem filling up our $6 billion to $7 billion of capital and allocating that to the projects that give us the highest risk-adjusted return and building those projects within our 5 to 7x build multiple. 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 5/16

Francois Poirier And Praneeth, it's Francois, just for the last part of your question around color coding returns from the different customer classes. We don't really think about it that way. I guess I would say we have a finite amount of capital. We want to invest to balance sheet strength, dividend growth and repeatable performance. The fact that there are 6 or 7 different sources of demand competing for our capacity directionally increases the likelihood of us being able to sanction projects at higher returns going forward than we've been able to sanction projects at in the past. And given the fact that we see our cost of capital heading in a favorable direction over the next year or 2, that means that we see the spread between our earned returns and our cost of capital widening in a meaningful way over the next couple of years, which gets us really excited. Praneeth Satish No, that's helpful. At the risk of this being maybe too early to ask, but I'll ask it anyway, there's a lot of opportunities, obviously, across the gas pipeline footprint. You have a CapEx limit in place for 2025. But do you view yourself as CapEx constrained where you need to high-grade projects? Because the way we see it, most of this demand pull gas projects have long lead times, in the 4-year range. And so even if you sanction the projects today, that spending doesn't really hit until the 2027, '28 time frame when your leverage is much lower. So how do you think about the long-term CapEx trajectory of the company given all these opportunities? Francois Poirier I guess what I'd say, Praneeth, is directionally, we are now entering sort of an organic deleveraging phase of our evolution. The beauty of our business and the strength of our franchise means that we have visibility of where we're going to allocate capital and are confident in being able to allocate that $6 billion to $7 billion of capital all the way out to the end of the decade, and we're going to give you more color on that on November 19 at our Investor Day. Right now, we feel it's a priority to build a little bit of cushion or room to maneuver below that 4.75x debt-to- EBITDA leverage. And until we see that manifest itself, we're not likely to be considering increasing the size of our capital program. But as you said, we still have plenty of capital in the outer years of the decade within which to allocate capital, and that's our primary area of focus right now. Operator Your next question will come from Rob Hope with Scotiabank. Robert Hope Good to see you progress on the cost optimization on the capital expenditure front. Can you give a little bit more color on what the key drivers have been there? And then also, I guess, on the expense side, has there been any progress made to improve EBITDA there as well? 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 6/16

Stanley Chapman Yes. This is Stan, again. I could take a start. We did announce that we are reducing our capital guidance from $8 billion to $8.5 billion to $7.4 billion to $7.7 billion. And you can think about that in a couple of different tranches. One is coming from our focus initiative that we talked to you about historically. Roughly $270 million or so of that savings are directly tied back to initiatives associated with our Focus program. So we're really pleased with respect to that. A big part of the balance is just due to really good execution on our project and our maintenance capital expenditures and reducing those costs going forward. Robert Hope And then maybe just as a follow-up there. Aside from the capital side of the business, what about the operating cost side of the business? Have the Focus Project yielded any incremental improvements there? And can you help us quantify that? Stanley Chapman Yes, it has. With respect to the Focus initiatives, about 30% of the value that we created was tied to expense reductions, O&M expense reductions. And again, we'll be flowing those through to customers as we have various tolling rate cases in the future. But what it does is it puts an emphasis on cash and makes us more efficient going forward. Operator Your next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen I wanted to touch on the CapEx question a bit more, specifically related to Southeast Gateway. Can you provide a little bit more color on the project cost downtick? What drove that? And related to that, what is the probability that commercial service may start earlier than the mid-2025 time frame since mechanical completion is earlier? Can you remind us what the status is of the downstream power gen assets, please? Stanley Chapman Yes, there's a lot there, and I'll try to unpack that for you. First of all, with respect to the cost savings, it's just a really good project execution, and you could think of about $140 million in savings on the procurement side. So we were able to buy materials and equipment for less. There's about $230 million in savings associated with more efficient construction and civil works activities. And those two things allowed us to release additional contingency of about $130 million. With respect to the power plants, I would just say that CFE's power plants generally remain on track, and the two that we're most focused on are the Merida and Valladolid plants, and both of those are tracking for Q1 2025 in- service. 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 7/16

Page 8
With respect to in-service, I would just say that we're meeting with CFE on a consistent basis to ensure that we have alignment around the various project completion activities, which include both the favorable impact on tolls due to the lower costs as well as the potential for an accelerated project completion date and payment date. And those discussions are continuing. And we'll have better line of sight on that with respect to the timing of in- service and payment once we get a little further down the road with the project construction activities. Theresa Chen Great. And as we look to 2025 and beyond, I would love to get an update on what your views are on how you're going to thread the needle with leverage. So will this be more of a self-help organic growth focused, organic CapEx-focused endeavor? Or are you contemplating additional asset sales from here to complement that? Sean O'Donnell Theresa, it's Sean. I'll take a stab at that one. A great question. Maybe let me start just with the 2024 plan to give you a context of what the levers that we have been pulling on the deleveraging plan, and we'll give you a sense of what 2025 and forward looks like. As we enter 2024 with 4.75x squarely in mind for year-end, we were relying on EBITDA performance, capital efficiency and CapEx and asset sales. And we were guiding kind of our internal planning conservatively on EBITDA, conservatively on CapEx, and we targeted about $3 billion worth of asset sales for this year. What you're seeing in today's quarterly results, we're at the high end of EBITDA, a couple of hundred million ahead on EBITDA, $700 million ahead on CapEx. That's $1 billion. And as Francois mentioned, $1 billion in savings it's a 2-for-1. It's almost the value of $2 billion worth of asset sales. So we have gotten to our leverage target in 2024, through the lease cost or highest value retention path possible, really through these CapEx savings that Stan talked about. So a little bit of a preview of Investor Day, the $700 million we're talking to you about today is a component of about $2.5 billion worth of CapEx savings that we have across the next couple of years of our development portfolio, in addition to some of the savings that are hitting EBITDA in the next couple of years. So we're going to get into the composition and the timing of all of that at Investor Day, but that is to say our '25 leverage target, in particular, is going to benefit from the same trend on EBITDA and CapEx as we're talking about today. But we'll unpack that further for you in 2 weeks. Operator Your next question will come from Maurice Choy with RBC. Maurice Choy Just want to come back to a comment Stan mentioned about being target-rich and not having trouble filling up the CapEx plan. Just philosophically speaking, like do you tend to want to high-grade some of these and max out at $6 billion to $7 billion? Or would you prefer to find alternative non-equity funding like sales or even JV partners to build more and keep it within $6 billion to $7 billion net? But with that, specifically, would you bring in a partner first and then build? Or would you build and then look for funding solution later? 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 8/16

Page 9
Francois Poirier Maybe I'll take a crack at that one, Maurice, it's Francois. Yes, absolutely, we've talked about the benefit of having partners like GIP on our TCO system, allowing us on a gross basis to continue to allocate the full amount of capital that the system needs in order to maintain its incumbency position while, at the same time, allowing us to manage to our $6 billion to $7 billion capital spend on a net basis. To the extent we see opportunities to bring in additional partners or to rotate capital from mature assets down the road in order to improve our EBITDA growth and improve our return on invested capital on our existing assets, we will absolutely contemplate those. For the time being, however, we are resolute on the $6 billion to $7 billion. We think it's important for us to continue to organically delever over time and build some cushion below that 4.75x metric. And because we see the spread between our earned return and our cost of capital widening over the next couple of years, we really are very confident in our ability to continue to grow EBITDA, grow cash flow per share and therefore, grow the dividend in a commensurate manner. Maurice Choy And just to finish up on a question on Southeast Gateway. You mentioned that there remains 1.4 kilometers of shallow water construction. Is that the only material construction work item left? Or are there other work items that you're watching that might derail your cost or timing? And in particular, given that you have savings from this overall cost structure, I assume that there is no change to your expected EBITDA and there's no sharing involved here? Stanley Chapman With respect to the work, the 1,400 meters we have left for the most part is the last of the major work. After that, we're really going to turn our attention to pre-commissioning activities and then commissioning activities and an in-service date no later than mid-2025. There is cost sharing in the agreement that we have with CFE, and we will be adjusting the totals accordingly once we know what the final capital expenditures are. Francois Poirier And Maurice, you'll see in our forecast and our outlook for EBITDA for 2025 and beyond, we will have adjusted for the revised capital spend. We thought that the cost sharing, basically on a 50-50 basis when CFE only owns 13% currently of the common equity, provided us with good downside protection. We have a happy customer. We've reduced our capital spend by $600 million. So I think it's a happy day for everybody. Operator Your next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 9/16

I wanted to ask on data center-linked opportunities. Are you thinking at all about vertical integration and potentially even getting into behind-the-meter gas-fired power plant? I know the company used to build gas power plants. And then relatedly, how are you thinking about the EPA 111(d) rule eventually requiring CCS for new gas plants and how that's impacting discussions with customers? Annesley Wallace So I'll take the first part of your question around gas-fired generation. We are not, as part of our Power & Energy Solutions strategy, looking to build stand-alone gas-fired power generation. We clearly see benefits across existing portfolio to increase electricity demand as a result of the tailwinds in the sector. It doesn't necessarily preclude us looking at gas-fired generation to the extent it was supportive of investment we were looking to make on our gas transmission side of the business. However, it would have to compete with capital across the portfolio. So we would be looking at those projects only to the extent we saw returns that were competitive with the opportunities that we have in the portfolio. Francois Poirier And with respect, Keith, to the second part of your question around the EPA rule. Look, obviously, we comply with regulations at all times. That rule, if applied, would be applied uniformly across the industry, meaning that every developer and operator of gas-fired generation would have to comply with it. We'll see what policy changes come from a new administration in the United States. And as I said, when it comes to natural gas for power generation, the data centers have high ambitions around developing their projects. It's not only economics, it's time to in- service. And we feel that natural gas-fired power generation is going to be the broad solution to meet their electricity requirements. There are only so many nuclear plants that you can de-mothball and they need the reliability that natural gas provides. So we're not concerned about regulation materially impairing the competitiveness of gas-fired generation going forward. Keith Stanley Second question, just curious if there's any update on discussions with stakeholders for a sell-down of NGTL, if you're optimistic on that, and potential time line? Francois Poirier Yes. So there's kind of two parts to that question, Keith. I'll answer the first part, and then I'll ask Sean to pick up the second part. And I want to underscore that we do continue to work with our indigenous partners to find a pathway forward. We think indigenous economic participation is really important, but I'm going to limit my comments on these ongoing discussions out of respect for the 72 communities and all of those involved in the process. We will, of course, provide material updates as they come available. But there is a question behind that one, which is our need and reliance on that transaction for deleveraging, and I'll pass that over to Sean. Sean O'Donnell 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 10/16

Page 11
Yes. Thanks, Francois. Look, generally, just a question about our asset sales required for our 4.75x target, the answer there, broadly speaking, is no. And that is good news, right? Our EBITDA outperformance and the CapEx savings, not only the $700 million today, but the $2.5 billion that we'll talk about in a couple of weeks, takes the pressure off really, removes the pressure of selling assets, as we're going into this organic deleveraging phase. So we are pleased to do not have to look specifically at asset sales solely for the purpose of hitting our leverage targets going forward. Operator The next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta Thanks for all the positive updates on the Southeast Gateway. I just wanted to talk about the other growth projects, which are also coming on in the next 12 to 18 months, whether it's Columbia, Gulf expansion or NGTL System Phase 2. Can you give us an update on the progress you are making on the other key growth projects expected to come online in the next 12 to 18 months? Stanley Chapman Yes, over the next 12 months or so, we have about $8.5 billion of capital coming into service, largely led by SGP which, as you heard, is trending very positively. And then we have 2 big projects in the U.S., both of which are trending on time and on budget. So very much a good news story overall. Manav Gupta Perfect. And then how should we think about expansion plans in Bruce? And how does that fit into your overall portfolio? Annesley Wallace So for Bruce Power, we continue to grasp the refurbishment program, and it is going exceptionally well. As you likely are aware, the Unit 3 MCR outage began in Q1 of 2023 with expected completion in Q2 of 2026. Costs and schedule are tracking to plan with the fuel channel assembly removal series complete and the inspection series well underway. And the next MCR is Unit 4. We received the ISO approval to proceed in February, and there is a refurbishment outage start date planned for Q1 of 2025. So all of the preparation work is well underway, and we are now transitioning to get ready for construction start early next year. So we continue to be very pleased with the capital that we continue to invest in Bruce Power. It allows us ongoing opportunity as part of our $6 billion to $7 billion capital program of about $1 billion per year at very good returns through to the end of the decade. Operator 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 11/16

Page 12
The next question will come from Olivia Halferty with Goldman Sachs. Olivia Halferty I wanted to go back to the CapEx budget for next year onward. How much of that $6 billion to $7 billion annual CapEx budget is already committed over the next 2 years? And on the other side, how much is uncommitted and therefore, open to add natural gas demand growth-related projects? Francois Poirier Thanks for the question, Olivia. Again, I think because of the strength of our franchise and the visibility we have in terms of the development projects going forward, the lion's share of our capital for 2025 is committed. We've got a little bit of room, and we'll show you more data on this at the coming Investor Day on the 19th of November. We've got a little bit of room in some of the other years, but we're already looking to fill and sanction projects with spend and in-service dates in the latter part of the decade. Again, we're, I think, a little bit unique in our ability to provide you with a fairly high degree of visibility on where the capital is going to be allocated, and we know the return profiles are right to the end of the decade. Olivia Halferty Got it. And one more. Following the spin-off of the Liquids business and as you near completion of Southeast Gateway, how are you thinking of balancing the broader opportunity set in Mexico from here versus managing total business exposure in the region? Francois Poirier So I think perhaps the one exception to deleveraging being organic and divestiture program being done would be in Mexico, but it's not really any more for deleveraging purposes. This would be about managing our customer concentration risk and our Mexico exposure overall. We are still working on, and we do have in our plans in the latter part of '25 or in the first half of '26, to be looking at either bringing in a partner or some other way to reduce our exposure. That's good news because we see additional growth opportunities in-country once the backbone of the infrastructure is built. Adding fingers and toes to that infrastructure are very attractive risk-adjusted returns. But in order for us to be contemplating any additional capital, we're going to have to reduce our exposure. Pro forma for Southeast Gateway going into service will be at about 15% of consolidated EBITDA. We'd like to see that come down. We believe that derisking and putting into service, all of the cash flow streams we have in Mexico before doing that is really the way to maximize shareholder value. Operator Next question will come from Robert Catellier with CIBC. Robert Catellier 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 12/16

Page 13
You've answered most of my questions already. So maybe just a couple of quick project updates. First of all, on Coastal GasLink, it sounds like that first phase will be in-service before too long. Do you have any sense of where we are with Phase 2? Stanley Chapman Yes. This is Stan. Really, no new updates with respect to Phase 2 since we last spoke. We're continuing to do early development work as requested by LNGC and assess the Phase 2 expansion opportunities and obviously, the final investment decision rests with them. Robert Catellier And a similar question for the Ontario pump storage. Are there any updates on the progress there, getting the required commercial framework? Annesley Wallace Yes. Thanks. It's Annesley. We continue to remain very excited about the project. We continue to see significant economic benefits for the province, our partnership with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation and the benefits that the long-duration storage nature of the project can bring to the province's nuclear ambition. There was a new minister of Energy and Electrification appointed in Ontario in June. And there's been a renewed focus on moving the project to the next phase which is simply some development work that will allow us to narrow the project capital cost estimate. So we are working on an agreement that would take the form likely of a cost recovery agreement so that we will be in a position to be able to advance the project to that next stage. So the discussions continue, and we hope to be able to come to some conclusion from a commercial perspective that allows us to continue that project. Operator The next question will come from Ben Pham with BMO. Benjamin Pham May I start off with Bruce Power and the high availability during the quarter? I think it's a record from what I can see historically. Can you talk about what was driving that utilization? Was this something also externally driven? And then can you talk about the availability of your units on a post-MCR basis? Annesley Wallace Yes. Thanks very much for the question. So Bruce Power did have a record availability in the quarter. It was not an externally driven factor, it was because there were no planned outages in the quarter for Bruce Power. And so that just allowed a much higher availability for the units, and we only have 1 unit under MCR right now. And so that's how we were able to achieve the output that we did for the quarter. 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 13/16

Page 14
Heading into the fourth quarter, it will be similar because again, we'll only have 1 unit under MCR and we don't have any planned outages for the quarter. However, it will not continue into 2025. We expect to go back to having that availability factor around low 90s as has been the case, and that's just because we will continue to have planned outages as we have historically. Benjamin Pham Okay. Got it. I mean low 90s is still pretty good. And maybe the second question, on EBITDA growth guidance, maybe thinking about through the end of the decade, if you're hypothetically spending $6 billion to $7 billion self- funded, returns are still pretty good. What do you expect in terms of EBITDA growth on a CAGR basis through the end of the decade? Francois Poirier I think what we'd like to do, Ben, with great respect for the question is to give you insights along with a whole bunch of information to support the credibility of that range at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks. So if I could ask you to be patient until then, we'll be able to answer that question in a very fulsome manner. Operator Next question will from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet Just wanted to come back to Southeast Gateway, if I could, a little bit of a different angle here. Just wondering, everything you're saying here, it sounds like mechanical completion is imminent in-service, all the commissioning, very quick as well. Just wondering, if it does reach in-service early, is there the potential to serve other customers in that market if it's available before the agreed start date? And specifically, as it relates to leverage, how much deleveraging does this project in-service deliver? Stanley Chapman Yes. Jeremy, I'll take the first part of that. We still have a little bit of work to do with respect to pre-commissioning and commissioning activities. We should get to mechanical completion sometime around year-end or slightly thereafter. And again, we're working towards a contractual in-service date midyear 2025. And if we can improve upon that, we will. With respect to serving markets, again, CFE is our customer, and this gas is destined to serve power generation facilities in the Yucatán Peninsula. Sean O'Donnell Jeremy, it's Sean. Thanks for the question. Look, we're going to give you all sorts of kind of modeling metrics for this here in the next 2 weeks. But look, round numbers, full year basis, what SGP is going to deliver us, CAD 750 million EBITDA. So you can kind of just on a full year basis, depending on how you're modeling kind of debt 3/1/25, 2:55 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118848&ts=3305185&ref=l6cin7 14/16

numbers for us, it will be kind of 0.05 to plus or minus 1, but we'll have all that model detail for you at Investor Day. Jeremy Tonet Got it. Interesting. And fingers and toes in Mexico, it sounds like data center opportunities there potentially. But I wanted to shift a little bit. I think the appetite for nuclear in Ontario kind of stands out versus other areas, I think. And we see the Bruce C study there. You've described yourself as the best intersection of electron molecules here. Could you walk us through how the portfolio enables you to capitalize in the current environment, specifically the nuclear side, granted it could be a little bit later dated. But what do you see as potential there on your site? Annesley Wallace I'll start with Bruce Power, specifically. And so our Power and Energy Solutions strategy with respect to nuclear is really focused on our investment in Bruce Power, and that's because we have an incredibly strong power purchase agreement that goes all the way out to 2064 and allows us to continue to invest meaningful capital through that agreement with very good returns. And so we're committed to continuing the refurbishment program. For Bruce C, as I think we've shared, it's still in the very early stages with a site impact assessment being done but it demonstrates that there's the potential for even further commitment to nuclear further out. But it gives us ample opportunity to really maximize the value of our existing investments to deploy capital at really strong returns. Francois Poirier And Jeremy, as to more broadly our interest, look, the secret sauce in nuclear is, in terms of growth potential, you have a good site, you have an operating license because those licenses are very expensive and time consuming to achieve, and then you have a management team that has a strong track record of operational and project execution excellence. We believe that our team at Bruce has demonstrated that amply with bringing in Unit 6 MCR in the middle of COVID on budget and a month early. So with those 3 factors being critical to us allocating capital into nuclear, we don't really see the need for us to expand beyond the Bruce Power site. We think there's ample opportunity for us to invest capital as part of our $6 billion to $7 billion going really into the 2030s. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. If there are any further questions, please contact Investor Relations at TC Energy. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Gavin Wylie for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the TC Energy Fourth Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Gavin Wylie, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gavin Wylie Thank you very much, and good morning. I'd like to welcome you to TC Energy's 2024 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Joining me are Francois Poirier, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sean O'Donnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, along with other members of our senior leadership team. Francois and Sean will begin today with some comments on our financial results and operational highlights. A copy of the slide presentation that will accompany their remarks is available on our website under the Investors section. Following their remarks, we'll take questions from the investment community. [Operator Instructions] And if you're a member of the media, please contact our media team. I'll remind you today that remarks will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information, please see the reports filed by TC Energy with the Canadian Securities regulator and with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. Finally, during the presentation, we will refer to non-GAAP measures that provide additional information on TC Energy's operational and financial performance. However, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. A reconciliation of various GAAP and non-GAAP measures is contained in the appendix of this presentation. With that, I'll turn it over to Francois. Francois Poirier Thanks, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. 2024 has been a year of significant achievement on milestones for TC Energy, and we're continuing to deliver on our strategic priorities. First, we're proud to report the best safety performance for our company in the past 5 years. As I've mentioned previously, we firmly believe that  󰍉 TRP 󰍝  3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 1/16

outstanding safety practices lead to superior operational performance, which, of course, drives strong financial results. Though in 2024, we increased comparable EBITDA from continuing operations by 6% compared to 2023. We successfully completed the spinoff of our Liquids business and the declaration of commercial in-service for Coastal GasLink. We successfully placed $7 billion of assets into service while reducing our net capital expenditures by 10% and have identified an additional $1.3 billion of capital reductions to be realized in 2026 and 2027. With strong EBITDA performance, lower capital expenditures and completed asset sales, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, which Sean will address further. Finally, we're making substantial progress on our major projects. including Bruce Power Unit 3 MCR and of course, Southeast Gateway that remain on cost and schedule. Our public-private partnership with CFE on Southeast Gateway has been a huge success, delivering the project 13% below our original budget by leveraging the strength of both the CFE and TC Energy. On January 20, we completed the final golden welds and reached mechanical completion, a monumental achievement for both Mexico and TC. In mid-January, we met with the Secretary of Energy and the CFE and all parties continue to be aligned in finalizing the remaining project completion activities in order to achieve commercial in-service of Southeast Gateway on May 1. At a macro level, President Sheinbaum recently unveiled her Plan Mexico 2030. This plan targets moving Mexico's economy from 12th largest overall to tenth spot in 6 years and aims to attract over USD 270 billion in investments, in part through public-private partnerships such as ours. We believe there is strong alignment between the priorities of the government and CFE and the roll natural gas deliveries TC Energy enables. Our partnership with the CFE will remain a critical part of achieving the goals outlined in Plan Mexico. I want to thank our dedicated teams for their tireless efforts on the project and reiterate that this marks a material inflection point for TC Energy. Underpinned by wide-scale electrification, natural gas and electricity are projected to drive 75% of the growth in final energy consumption between now and 2035. This growth includes a threefold increase in LNG exports, strong growth in power generation driven by coal retirements and data center demand, LDC reliability needs and the material increase in Ontario's demand for additional nuclear generation capacity that all aligns with our North American footprint. Reflecting this opportunity, we recently announced five new growth projects with build multiples in the 5 to 7x range. The Pulaski and Maysville projects represent a combined investment of over USD 700 million on our Columbia Gulf system, and will facilitate coal-to-gas conversions at two existing power plants. The USD 300 million Southeast Virginia Energy Storage Project, is an LNG peaking facility that will serve an LDC's growing winter peak day load. At Bruce Power, we are progressing the Stage 3a of Project 2030, which will provide incremental capacity of 90 megawatts. When complete, Project '30 will add approximately 700 megawatts of incremental capacity. So we expect total Bruce output to reach over 7,000 megawatts post MCR and Project 2030. Additionally, on January 31, we submitted to the Ontario IESO, the final basis of estimate for Bruce Power's latest nuclear project, the Unit 5 Major Component Replacement. The refurbishment is expected to extend Unit 5's operational life by over 35 years. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 2/16

Let's take a closer look at Bruce Power and our Power and Energy Solutions business in Ontario. The Ontario IESO projects an approximately 69,000 megawatts shortfall in total installed capacity by year 2050, driven by industrial expansion, data center developments and population growth. Nuclear power and storage will be essential components to meeting Ontario's demand. We are actively involved in several key projects including not only Bruce Power's MCR program, but potential future expansion at Bruce C and the Ontario Pumped Storage Project. In January, we announced that TC Energy and the Saugeen Ojibway Nation will begin predevelopment work on the Ontario Pump Storage Project supported by the Ontario government's investment of up to $285 million to develop a detailed cost estimate and environmental assessments to further assess its feasibility. On the next slide, this chart illustrates our growth visibility through the end of the decade, and we will continue to add to this backlog. Our capacity to sanction incremental projects through the end of the decade is represented by the white space between our net CapEx limit of $6 billion to $7 billion and the colored bars. Collectively, this totals approximately $8 billion between 2026 and 2030. Given the backlog of development projects we are pursuing, we anticipate filling the majority of this remaining project capacity by the end of 2026, with lower-risk projects that can deliver attractive build multiples of 5 to 7x. Looking at 2026 specifically, we will aim to fill that spare capacity through a combination of small projects that have short cycle to cash flow and we are evaluating bringing forward capital expenditures from 2027 and 2028 to create additional capacity for new growth projects in those years. We'll continue to assess projects in our pending approval bucket represented by the gray bars, to ensure we have the flexibility for capital to compete for higher returning projects. Our goal is to create significant value by maximizing the spread between our earned returns and our cost of capital. Now a word on tariffs. We continue to assess the ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. There is significant energy flow between three countries, making our energy markets highly interdependent. We believe the 30-day pause on potential tariffs will support increased engagement with North America's leaders in order to reach an agreement that will benefit consumers across the continent. Given that 97% of our comparable EBITDA is under regulated cost of service frameworks or take-or-pay contracts, we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial performance. Our regulated Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines business, which transports gas to be exported to the U.S. by our shippers is protected against higher costs or loss of volumes. And our Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines business primarily receives gas from the Southern U.S. for delivery in Mexico and our contracts are in U.S. dollars and based on long-term take-or-pay agreements. In our Power and Energy Solutions business, Bruce Power is the most significant contributor, and over 90% of its supply chain is based in Canada. Now we recognize that prolonged tariffs could impact capital allocation decisions. However, our diverse portfolio across three jurisdictions enables us to continue allocating capital to markets with sustained energy demand. We'll continue to work with our customers across all three jurisdictions to ensure safe, reliable and competitive service. And now I'll turn the call over to Sean. Sean O'Donnell Thanks, Francois, and good morning, everybody. It's important to start this morning by recognizing that our team's outstanding safety and operational performance play a critical role in TC's continued strong financial results. On the left table, we highlight several operational and financial highlights from the quarter. Most notably, 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 3/16

our natural gas assets in each country set new delivery records from last November through February of this year. Bruce Power achieved exceptional performance with 99% availability which drove a 28% increase in quarterly EBITDA growth for our Power and Energy Solutions business unit. You may recall that Unit 6 concluded its MCR in 2023 and achieved availability of over 99% throughout calendar year '24. That's an availability trend that we hope to see as every unit concludes its MCR program over the rest of the decade. Overall, it's a remarkable accomplishment for TC to have each of our business units deliver exceptional safety performance while simultaneously setting new operational and annual EBITDA records from continuing operations. Moving to the EBITDA bridge on the right, I'll spend a moment on some of the more notable items. Canada Gas was the largest variance due to the $200 million incentive payment to Coastal GasLink at mechanical completion in the fourth quarter of 2023, that was not repeated in '24. In Mexico, we posted gains primarily related to the weakening of the peso where our revenues are paid in U.S. dollars. And finally, our Power and Energy Solutions team realized very strong results, primarily from Bruce Power's 14% improvement in availability year-over-year. Turning to Page 13. We summarized the components of our comparable earnings of $1.1 billion, which were 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest expense was higher in the quarter, primarily due to lower capitalized interest as assets were placed into service, increased levels of short-term borrowing, onetime charges related to the spin and the timing of our liability management program. Higher AFUDC was driven by our Southeast Gateway project that's expected to be placed into service this May, which was partially offset by higher NCI deductions. On the FX front, the EBITDA gains in Mexico are partially offset by losses in our corporate risk management program, where we hedge our Mexican net income from peso volatility. So to conclude the 2024 financial summary, TC delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter that was modestly ahead of our overall plan, and contributed to another record year of comparable EBITDA from continuing operations, which grew 6% for the year. This chart reflects how our record EBITDA from continuing operations of over $10 billion in 2024 compares to the EBITDA outlook we provided at Investor Day in November. Our base case is to deliver 2025 comparable EBITDA of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion, which represents a 7% to 9% increase year-over-year. Looking out to 2027, we project a target of $11.7 billion to $11.9 billion, which implies a 5% to 7% 3-year growth rate. It's important to note that our base case outlook uses an average U.S. to Canadian dollar exchange rate of $1.35, which is lower than rates we're seeing today. To help investors understand the potential upside to EBITDA from exchange rates. The rule of thumb we provide on the bottom right is that every $0.01 increase in USD/CAD roughly translates into $45 million of incremental EBITDA. As an example, if we picked an exchange rate of $1.43 that's $0.08 above plan and would result in 2025 EBITDA being approximately $350 million higher than our base case outlook. It's important to reiterate that we systematically hedge our U.S. dollar net income to insulate our comparable earnings from FX volatility. Given our hedge strategy, we do not expect a material impact related to FX on our 2025 comparable earnings. Longer term and on an unhedged basis, a $0.01 change in USD/CAD rates corresponds to roughly a $0.01 change in comparable EPS. Moving to the right side of the page, we summarize several other factors that could impact our EBITDA outlook. For our base case planning purposes, we tend to build in conservative views on rate case settlements and other revenue enhancement and cost optimization initiatives that have the potential to drive additional upside. We're also targeting better than historical availability on our operational portfolio, particularly at Bruce, where Unit 3 is scheduled to return to service next year. And finally, a key strategic priority remains placing our growth capital projects into service ahead of budget and schedule where possible. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 4/16

Turning to Page 15. We have made significant progress on our deleveraging efforts. Since 2022, we've delivered a 0.6x reduction in debt-to-EBITDA through asset divestitures, cost optimizations revenue enhancements and reductions in actual capital expenditures. We have company-wide efforts ongoing in each of these areas to drive our organic deleveraging program. One observation related to the year-end 2024 leverage metric. Fourth quarter was an anomaly with how quickly FX rates moved. We ended the year on December 31 with a spot rate of $1.44 USD/CAD, which was used for our balance sheet calculations versus an average rate in 2024 of $1.37, which we used for income statement purposes. That $0.07 FX timing differential resulted in the year-end 4.8x debt-to-EBITDA ratio, largely in line with our 4.75x target. However, using the same average FX rate of $1.37 for our debt and EBITDA conversions would have resulted in a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.65x. Regardless of the FX calculations, we made significant progress towards balance sheet strengthening. And I want to reiterate Francois' comment that we all remain steadfast in our deleveraging efforts and maintaining our long-term upper limit of 4.75x debt-to-EBITDA. To conclude, TC had an exceptional year in 2024, and I am pleased to share that our Board of Directors has declared a first quarter 2025 dividend of $0.85 per common share, which is equivalent to $3.40 per share on an annualized basis. This results in a 3.3% increase compared to TC Energy's fourth quarter dividend, which now reflects TC's proportionate dividend following the spin-off of South Bow. This represents our 25th consecutive year of dividend growth to our shareholders, which is a commitment we're proud to meet year after year as part of our shareholder value proposition, which is underpinned by our solid growth, low risk and repeatable performance. With that, I'll pass the call back to Francois. Francois Poirier Thanks, Sean. As I said before, we will maintain our focus on what got us here today, maximizing the value of our assets through safety and operational excellence; executing on our selective portfolio of growth projects, including bringing $8.5 billion of assets into service in 2025; and thirdly, ensuring financial strength and flexibility. By focusing on these clear priorities, we'll be able to deliver that solid growth, low risk and repeatable performance year after year. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Stan Chapman's retirement after an exceptional career at TC Energy. While we'll continue to benefit from Stan's experience as a member of Bruce Power's Board, I want to express my gratitude for his leadership, dedication and contribution over the years. Thank you, Stan. I'm also pleased to announce two recent appointments to our executive leadership team with Tina Faraca and Greg Grant. These changes are part of our deliberate and planful long-term succession plan, reflecting the strength and talent of our internal leadership. We've appointed Tina to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Natural Gas Pipelines business. Tina has been a member of our executive leadership team since 2023, bringing her on the executive leadership team at that time was a very intentional move to support the eventual transition of the Chief Operating Officer role. Tina has extensive experience across project development, engineering and operations as well as expertise in commercial operations and corporate strategy. She is a 30-plus year veteran of the industry and has a strong track record of both leadership and performance. We are also very pleased to announce Greg Grant in the role of Executive Vice President, Power and Energy Solutions. Greg has successfully led our Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines portfolio for the last 3 years and brings 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 5/16

Page 6
extensive experience across strategy, power, corporate development and commercial operations to his new role. I'm confident that Tina and Greg will continue to deliver exceptional results. With that, operator, we'd be pleased to answer questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish First, let me offer my congrats to Stan. You'll definitely be missed, but I'm sure you're glad you don't have to answer annoying questions from sell-side analysts. So let me start first with Southeast Gateway. I guess two questions here. First is the in-service date of May 1, is that a little earlier than prior indications, I think before it was -- the start-up was expected for June 1? And then second, maybe you can help us understand how your commercial contracts are structured to protect returns if there's any delay to some of the interconnecting pipelines like the Mayakan pipeline? And can you share any other details on your dialogue that you had with CFE around sinking up the various pieces of the network and if all parties are in agreement there? Stanley Chapman Praneeth, this is Stan, and thank you for the comments, and it's always a joy talking to you and your comrades on the call. With respect to May 1, I would just say that's very consistent with the guidance that we've given around the earnings related to SGP. To your broader statement with respect to the status of the plants and the timing around payment from CFE, here's what I can share with you. Our understanding is that the Mérida and the Valladolid plants, which are the two which are most relevant to SGP are both now mechanically complete and will be placed in-service as gas supply becomes available. CFE is looking at rebalancing its overall supply portfolio to get gas to the Mérida plant by Q4 2025. And when the first phase of the Mayakan expansion is complete, and the first phase is a compression-only expansion. Gas to the other plant, Valladolid is likely to commence around Q3 2027 when the Phase II expansion of the Mayakan pipeline is complete, and it's the Phase II expansion that will include the physical connectivity with SGP. In the meantime, CFE is continuing to talk to both us and other third parties about the potential to build short laterals off of SGP that could, amongst other things, get gas into the CENAGAS system, for example, to deliver gas to the plants perhaps a little bit earlier. I know many of you have questions around our in-service date of May 1 and the potential for us to get paid by CFE. And here's a couple of things that I would offer up for your consideration. First, we have 30-year contracts with CFE, and we're building infrastructure that's going to last more than twice as long. We have a strong, mutually beneficial partnership with CFE, and they understand that a May 1 in-service date represents the lowest overall cost for them. And in support of that, our understanding is that CFE has received budgetary approvals sufficient to fund SGP commencing on May 1. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 6/16

Page 7
Secondly, contractually, the in-service declaration for SGP is not tied to the availability of downstream third-party capacity, and our project is consistent with President Sheinbaum's Plan Mexico to attract investment, to build new infrastructure, and to reduce emissions. Thirdly, given the limited amount of storage capacity across Mexico and in order to provide some level of utility upon in-service, we've been discussing with CFE the potential to use the completed SGP pipeline for park and loan or storage service until the downstream lateral and interconnects are in place. Fourth, subject to further COFECE approvals, the press for commencing CFE's additional 2% equity stake is also triggered upon in-service. So there's an incentive from CFE for that perspective. But most importantly, what I want to leave you with is the comment that Francois made earlier. Francois, myself and our team went down to Mexico in January. We met with the Energy Secretary, we met with the CFE leadership, and we are all aligned on a May 1 in-service date for the project. Praneeth Satish Perfect. That's very comprehensive. I wanted to switch gears and maybe ask conceptually how you think about some of these potential behind-the-meter gas projects that some of your peers are pursuing. Would you be open to developing an integrated gas to power project where you provide both the pipeline infrastructure and potentially build the power generation assets, too? I know you have favorable slots in the order book for gas, simple-cycle gas turbines. So there's speed to market benefit here if you decide to do the projects. But just curious for your views on that. Francois Poirier Praneeth, it's Francois. I'll start on that specific strategies, but then I'll ask Tina to give you an overall picture on how bullish we are on data center demand growth based on the dozens of conversations we're having. On what I would call sort of a fully bundled or complementary solution where we're building a lateral, and also building the power plant for power generation. This is expertise that we've had for over 30 years in the company. We're an owner and operator today of gas-fired power plants in Alberta as well as in New Brunswick. We are, in fact, a large purchaser of gas turbines. But I would point out that those are primarily for the purpose of compression. They tend to be smaller units. We do not have any preferential position in the queue for larger turbines that would be used for power generation. But we are absolutely in conversations with a number of parties around direct connections where we would offer a combination of the two. We're not really interested in growing an IPP, independent IPP company within TC anymore. And we would only really contemplate new power generation in a sort of complementary fully bundled type of product offering. But again, we are extremely bullish on data center demand, and I'll ask Tina to expand on that. Tina Faraca Thanks, Francois. And Praneeth, maybe I'll give you a holistic picture of how we're thinking about data centers. Data centers are one component of our power demand opportunities that we're banding in addition to coal-to- gas conversions and other electrification growth. But when it's -- speaking specific to the data center sector, our vast footprint gives us access within 15 miles to 60% of the over 350 data centers that are under development. Additionally, we connect to 8 of the top 10 utilities and over 100 power plants, which is another competitive advantage for ours in serving data center demand. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 7/16

Page 8
We have about 10 gigawatts of requests into our business development team right now. We've increased commercial engagement with over 20 parties across the entire data center value chain. About $2 billion of potential opportunities within that sector and across several of our systems, Wisconsin, Ohio, Virginia, Kansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Nevada. Interestingly, the customer needs differ and they vary among developers. So our focused strategy is to work with our established high-quality utilities for the larger data center loads, and provide the necessary gas infrastructure to support their portfolio build-out. Additionally, we will develop the direct connect behind-the-meter solutions where it makes sense and fits our risk preferences. Let me give you a few key proof points and data set here. Our ANR Heartland project that we announced and sanctioned last year, about a $900 million project, 5 to 7x multiple. We'll now be serving data center demand alongside overall economic development demand in Wisconsin. We're going to be filing that project with FERC in the coming weeks and targeting November 2027 in- service. We've been tracking to sanction another data center-driven project anchored by some of our utility customers in the first half of 2024. And interestingly, we're now in discussions with those counterparties to potentially upsize that particular project and that might add a couple of months to our time line, but be a more meaningful expansion related to serving data center demand. We've developed a behind-the-meter solution to a data center in Loudoun County, Virginia that we placed in- service last year, and we're in active discussions on several similar direct connect opportunities. We also recently completed an open season on Columbia Gas that resulted in a 60,000 dekatherms a day being placed with a customer to supply gas to data center load behind-the-meter in the New Albany area in Ohio. And additionally, we're advancing new power plant interconnect projects totaling about 4.7 gigawatts of generation that will be serving growing electricity demand, including data centers. And as we advance all these projects, our approach will be consistent with our strategy of low risk, repeatable performance, long-term take-or-pay commitments, and attractive build multiples in the 5 to 7x range. Operator The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen First, I would also like to offer my congratulations to Stan on his retirement. We wish you well, and congratulations as well to Tina and Greg on your new roles. Maybe pivoting to the nuclear portion of your portfolio, in relation to Bruce C, while early on, what are the next steps towards FID? Do you have a time line in mind? And could it be subject to accelerated cost recovery similar to MCR? Francois Poirier Thanks, Theresa, it's Francois. We're -- given the fundamentals in Ontario with the projected 69 gigawatt shortfall of capacity, by 2050, we're very bullish on the role nuclear will play. Nuclear is the way Ontario will be serving data center demand as well as other industrial demand as Ontario looks to reshore manufacturing. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 8/16

For the MCR program, we bear the cost and schedule risk on those projects. We have demonstrated with the successful return to service of Unit 6 and Unit 3 being on time and on budget as well that we are very effectively managing that risk. On Bruce C, it's still early days. We have many years of development work and assessment work to assess the potential for that project, including what technologies we would use, supply chain impacts, labor, et cetera. What I would say there is you're unlikely to see us bearing a significant amount of cost and schedule risk on new build. It simply does not fit our low-risk value proposition. And we would look to be taking on a more traditional cost of service ratemaking model in the case of Bruce C. Maybe one way to think about this from a timing standpoint is, nuclear sites have a huge competitive advantage in terms of nuclear growth. First is you've got an operating license. Second, you have a community in the surrounding area that's comfortable with having nuclear operations nearby. Third, in the case of Bruce Power, we have footprint to put Bruce C and Bruce D on the site going forward. And fourth, we have, I believe, one of the most competent, if not the most competent management team in the nuclear space. The existing units are both operating at very high levels of efficiency now with INPO 1 ratings. So Bruce was very strategic. They invested in training, building trades and labor to do the refurbishment work. And a natural time line would be to evolve from the MCR projects, which will wrap up in 2031 or '32 into new build at that time. So there's a lot of planning work to do, but as you pointed out, we're very excited about the long-term potential for nuclear. It is going to be a significant growth wedge for this company over the long term. Theresa Chen And looking to your leverage and general balance sheet outlook, what is the path forward with S&P at this point after it reaffirmed your BBB+ negative outlook rating late last month. What do you think it will take to improve that outlook? Sean O'Donnell Theresa, it's Sean. Look, without speaking to S&P specifically, we don't like to speak to what any one rating agency may do. I'll offer that. We're in regular contact with all the agencies. They have previewed the Investor Day materials and each of them have gone through their annual review. And as you noted, S&P recently in the last 2 or 3 weeks, completed it. And look, the dialogue with each of the agencies, there's a major focus on SGP coming on time and on budget. And you heard from Stan today, that's probably the most frequent conversation we have with each of the agencies. And then as it relates to the balance of the year, it's more or less just delivering on the plan and that $6 billion to $7 billion capital range, right, that we execute on time and on budget within that $6 billion to $7 billion range. I really think that's the recipe for our organic deleveraging and continued success with each of the agencies. Operator The next question comes from Maurice Choy with RBC. Maurice Choy 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 9/16

I wanted to turn to Canada. And the question here is about Mainline. And how much mothballed capacity is there on the system? And what would it take to bring it back, including cost and timing? And as far as that, there's obviously a lot of Canadian LNG projects that are being discussed right now given the onset of potential tariffs, and some of these costs are pretty massive. So to the extent that the company is involved, how committed are you to your $6 billion to $7 billion target? Stanley Chapman Maurice, I can take the first part of that. This is Stan, and Francois can answer the second piece. With respect to spare capacity on the Mainline. I would just say that given the strong demand that we're seeing for natural gas, the amount of spare capacity that we have is very different today than it was 10 years ago, back in 2015. For example, the restoration work that we did on the Western Mainline was completed in 2023 and 2024, and our contracts since then have increased from around 3 Bcf a day to 5 Bcf a day, which has resulted in all the available Mainline capacity being fully contracted. We do have one line that we refer to as Line 2 that is currently not available for service. And as market demand for this capacity continues to mature, we're going to reevaluate things like the timing, the cost, and the potential capacity that could be optimized and perhaps restored subject to any upstream and downstream constraints. So just bear with us and give us time to complete that work as the market needs materialize. Francois Poirier And Maurice, with respect to what I would call the -- an energy corridor from coast to coast to coast, lots of inquiries on the liquid side. I would refer those to our friends and former colleagues at South Bow. On the natural gas side, there is absolutely demand for more LNG export and market opportunity for us to prosecute. We're very bullish about the prospects for CGL Phase 2 happening. That, of course, is only an input into the FID decision that our customer LNG Canada will make in due course. And looking at other infrastructure in Canada, it's going to have to compete for capital in our company as it has for the last few years with projects in other jurisdictions. Right now, we see the highest risk-adjusted returns being in the United States. The vast majority of our discretionary capital is going, and we expect that it will continue to go into the United States. However, there is an interesting data center opportunity in Alberta. We've been working closely with a number of stakeholders to understand where there may be spare capacity in our system in Alberta. And we see some very exciting opportunities there. There are 10,000 gigawatts -- pardon me, 10 gigawatts of interconnection requests within Alberta. It's a very natural market for data center development, and we feel we'll be very well positioned for that. It would not necessarily be within our NGTL entity. It may be in separate unregulated entities where the return -- the risk return profile is different than for NGTL. Maurice Choy Understood. And maybe just finishing up on capital allocation as you alluded to here. You mentioned in the press release that prolonged tariffs could impact capital allocation decisions. And I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that, recognizing, as you say that the U.S. is already your largest geography for near-term CapEx with limited investments in Canada thus far. So just curious what other adjustments you can make to capital allocation? 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 10/16

Page 11
Francois Poirier So I'll start, and I'll ask Tina to talk a little bit about our supply chains right now and where we are with respect to capital cost impacts. Simply, Maurice, that was a reflection of the fact that we will reflect any changes in prices of key raw materials and inputs and any future capital allocation decisions with the vast majority of the future discretionary capital going into the U.S. for projects that would transport molecules from U.S. production to U.S. demand centers. There would be no tariff impacts. We feel that there's plenty of domestic capacity for steel production and pipe application in the United States to meet our projects. But we would, of course, have the benefit of how things transpire and factor those into our projects. Maybe, Tina, you can expand on our current supply chain situation. Tina Faraca Sure. Thanks, Francois. We expect very modest impacts on materials for our Canadian and U.S. projects, primarily fittings and flanges, no impacts to Mexico projects. We take regular actions to address and mitigate any cost escalation risk across our entire portfolio. For the U.S. for all of our sanctioned projects, pipe has already been procured for those projects and were sourced from U.S. mills. Those pipe orders are firm pricing. So any market volatility is the vendors risk. We also deploy a very diverse sub-supplier base for all of our materials, and primarily procure large-scale materials in advance focused on a subset of proven suppliers in exchange for mutually beneficial commercial benefits. Francois Poirier So just to maybe come back around to that, Maurice, what I would say is, as we look out to the end of the decade, we -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect to be filling the balance of our incremental capital capacity by the end of next year. And we still see build multiples in the 5 to 7x EBITDA range for the projects we are looking to sanction between now and then. Maurice Choy That make sense. And obviously, my congrats to Stan for your upcoming retirement, and Tina and Greg for your new roles. Operator The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet I just want to echo that, Stan, congrats on a great career. You will certainly be missed and want to send a happy Valentine's Day to everyone as well. But maybe just the first question here, if you could quantify, I guess, maybe upside to the plan, at least as we see it, it seems like business operations are going well as far as nuclear operating rates and possibly what you get in some of these rate settlements here? It just seems like there's some up pressure on the guide, but I was wondering if you could kind of provide more thoughts there. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 11/16

Sean O'Donnell Jeremy, it's Sean. Yes, look, in my section, we gave you a couple of different things that we pay attention to that can impact the outlook, arguably either way. But to your specific question, Bruce just continues to perform incredibly well at levels, at least in the fourth quarter, above what we discount in the plan for conservatism, kind of low 90s is how we think about it. You've asked me in the past about FX rates. We provided a little bit of clarity there. And for benefit of just perspective, we've got kind of a high, medium, low rolling hedge program over 3 years, and we're watching that curve very carefully to think about what we might do differently kind of in the medium- to longer-term to capture some impact there. And look, some of the proven recipe about upside that you saw in '24 continue, right, in terms of rate case strategy, EBITDA and overall cost reduction. So it's a multifaceted plan that we're a solid year into making work. So I appreciate the question. Jeremy Tonet Got it. That's helpful. And if I kind of look through the deck a little bit here, Slide 7, 9, it just seems like there's a lot of things cooking right now. And so as you think about the potential for new projects here with leverage kind of really falling off both Southeast Gateway. How do you think about the cadence of how these projects could materialize over kind of like the 2026, 2030 time frame? Just trying to get a feel for what's possible. Francois Poirier Well, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Jeremy, in the near term, we're tackling the white space we have in 2026. We are working on a number of different proposals to deploy smallish amounts of capital in short-cycle projects to cash flow. We're looking at opportunities to bring forward some capital spend from 2027 and 2028 in order to create some additional capacity in those years as well. For us to sanction in aggregate approximately $8 billion of remaining capital to the end of the year, by the end of 2026, you're going to see a regular cadence throughout the next several quarters, submitting the basis of estimate on Unit 5 as we did on January 31. The basis of estimate was within the range contemplated inside the contract. The IESO, of course, has assurance and verification rights on the validity of the estimates. But given the fact that the estimate was inside the range contemplated in the contract, we have a very high degree of confidence that we'll be making an FID on yet another unit at Bruce Power in the very near future. So we're seeing opportunities not only in our gas business with coal-to-gas conversion, with data centers, but also on the nuclear side, with the shortfall and the signals we're getting from the Ontario government with a shortfall in supply, that's part of the reason why they were agreeable to provide us with $285 million of incremental capital to advance the development on Ontario Pumped Storage. So we're really bullish about where our footprint sits and the growth prospects that come with the fundamentals in each of those markets. And so again, our goal is a large number of small projects, low risk inside our corridors. And so you're going to see a regular cadence throughout the next 7 or 8 quarters, and that's how we're going to be filling the remaining amount of our backlog. And I would argue that our focus, which is on extending the duration of our capital program is a little bit unique among our peers. We feel it's very important in the near term to manage and maintain capital discipline and stay at or below that $6 billion to $7 billion range. We are not losing out on any opportunities right now. And -- but we're also able to sanction projects with in-service all the way through the end of the decade. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 12/16

Operator The next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta I have two questions, and I'll just ask them upfront. First of all, at your Analyst Day, you announced four new projects, and we got some more updates today. Can you help us with some more details on how those four projects that you did announce are progressing? And the second one, you talked in detail about the data center opportunities. Can you also talk a little bit about the coal-to-gas switching opportunities that you're seeing out there? Tina Faraca I'll take the first question about our announced projects and also roll into your second question. We announced in the U.S. three projects, two of those are the coal-to-gas conversion projects located off of our Columbia Gulf system and a Virginia project to support our local distribution companies reliability needs with LNG peaking supply. Those projects are progressing nicely. We're in early stages of developing our FERC applications, landowner notifications, progressing that well, and those will be delivered in the time lines noted in our disclosures. So those are going really well. From a coal to gas perspective, we continue to see many opportunities across our footprint. We've got 42 operating plants within 15 miles of our assets that are coal. Nine of those plants are planned to retire by 2031, combined capacity about 9 gigawatts, and there's about 19 gigawatts within 50 miles of our pipelines expected to retire through 2033. We're seeing many of those come to fruition. For example, in the Midwest, we have a couple of different projects, our Wisconsin Reliability and our upcoming ANR Heartland project that are supporting coal-to-gas conversions. We are also in active discussions on about 7.5 gigawatts of generation of additional conversion opportunities, and we'll continue to pursue all those that adhere to our $6 billion to $7 billion capital plan and achieved a 5 to 7x build multiple. Operator The next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. John Mackay I just wanted to circle back to Mexico in the context of everything we've talk through today and in the context of tariff noise, et cetera. Can you just give us an update on the potential separation or sell-down or however you want to frame it from the Mexico business sits today? Francois Poirier Thanks, John, it's Francois. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, our goal is to get all of the pipes flowing gas and then get all of the pipes flowing cash, if you will. We expect to be doing that, of course, on Southeast 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 13/16

Gateway by May 1. On Tula-Villa de Reyes, we're expecting to have that done by the end of the year as well. So we'd like to see that behind us, have all of our projects complete and in-service. And then we'll be turning our attention to that opportunity. As we mentioned, we'll be considering both capital markets solutions, an IPO of sorts as well as a minority interest sale to a buyer along the same style of transaction as we did with the GIP on Columbia. Time line for that, think of it as the first half of 2026. We think that is the manner in which we'll maximize value for our shareholders and establish a positive mark for the balance of the portfolio. And we also see so much growth outside of Mexico that not only -- selling down our interest is not the only tool to work down our exposure. The other tool will be growing our businesses in Canada and the U.S. And the other way we're thinking about managing and mitigating risk in Mexico is you can expect us once SGP is in-service to start looking at some Mexico level or perhaps even asset-level financing to help reduce our equity capital at risk in Mexico. So stay tuned for that. John Mackay All right. That's helpful. And then second one, this is probably quick. But just looking at your breakdown of kind of forward growth projects on Slide 9, the breakdown looks pretty different from the Analyst Day. Is that new projects coming in? Is that just a rebucketing of existing ones? Maybe just walk us through that. Sean O'Donnell Did you have a particular year? We may have changed the color scheme on you a little bit, but that pipeline hasn't changed much a few minor additions, particularly in... John Mackay Yes. I guess, I'm looking at the power gen being 56% now versus 32% in the Investor Deck. It might be rebucketing. But I want to say that some new projects coming in. Gavin Wylie I think it's just the color coating that might just be picking up a little bit different in your slides. I can provide a clarification after the call. Operator The next question comes from Ben Pham with BMO. Benjamin Pham May I start off on the Columbia rate case. Could you update us on a recent customer feedback and expected timing? Tina Faraca 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 14/16

Page 15
Yes. We'd be happy to give you a brief update. As you're familiar, we filed our rate case for our Columbia Gas system last year. Rates do go into effect in April of this year. Right now, we are waiting for what we call top sheets from FERC, which will outline their position of our rate case. And typically, after you see those top sheets, the negotiations with our customers ramp up in earnest towards settlement discussions. And so we would continue to plan to set all that rate case mutually beneficial to our customers and our company here, likely in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Benjamin Pham Okay. And maybe a second question, the data centers more specifically Alberta, there's mentioned -- you mentioned Francois, maybe look at non-reg part of things. Is that in reference to your gas plants you have there? Or are you referencing something else? Francois Poirier No, it would be unregulated or pipelines, I should say, not regulated by NGTL, but by the Alberta Energy Regulator. So there's no reference there to power gen. Operator I understand there's time for one last question that will come from Jessica Hoyle from Scotiabank. Jessica Hoyle So just starting with the Power segment. Can you talk a little bit more about the path forward for the Ontario Pumped Storage Project, just given the recent support from the government? Francois Poirier Thanks, Jessica, for that question. The funding from the Ontario government is to advance the development of that project, including the requisite environmental assessments, getting us to a point where we could make a final investment decision. That time line is 2028. There is a considerable amount of work to do on continuing the work around contracting, geotechnical work, et cetera, we would not proceed with a project like that without having a very high-quality Class 3 estimate. And of course, the environmental work will take a couple of years when you look at both the federal and provincial requirements. And then, of course, it would be a 4- or 5-year construction period beyond then. So there's lots of work continuing. It's 1,000 megawatts of effectively a 12-hour battery. The Ontario government just recently announced a ban on Chinese parts. And of course, that makes this project more attractive to them for firming resources compared to the battery alternatives where much of the supply chain is reliant on China. So we're very interested in the project. Our intention at the end of the day, would be not to sanction this unless it was with cost of service regulation. We will not take cost and schedule risk on a project of that nature. And then again, it will have to compete with the balance of our investment opportunities in the capital stack for an allocation of capital. 3/1/25, 2:54 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1918153009&ts=3374790&ref=l6cin7 15/16

Jessica Hoyle Appreciate that color. And then can you talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the next wave of LNG and how TC Energy's pipelines could serve and support that? Tina Faraca Yes, I'll start with the U.S. And we have a great footprint in Louisiana, in particular, with our Columbia Gulf and our ANR assets and have quite a bit of connectivity already with several of the LNG export terminals in that area. We're now progressing a project called Eastern -- East Lateral XPress that will come into service later this year to supply capacity to one of the LNG export terminals in Louisiana. We also have an intrastate project called Gillis that we'll be extending to serve additional load in Louisiana as well as in the Gulf Coast with LNG exports. And I'll turn it over to Stan for any Canadian and Mexico updates. Stanley Chapman So big picture-wise, in Canada, you all are aware that the CGL pipeline is currently in-service, and we are currently now waiting for the in-service of the terminal itself. We are continuing to advance scope and other work products with respect to Phase 2. And again, that FID decision rests with LNGC as well. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. If there are any further questions, please contact Investor Relations at TC Energy. I will now turn the call over to Gavin Wylie for any closing remarks. Gavin Wylie Well, thanks, everybody, for joining. I know everybody's out there today has a very busy day with several of our peers reporting. So thank you for your time for joining the call. Thank you for your interest in TC Energy. As Drew mentioned here. If there are any additional questions, please do feel free to contact the Investor Relations team at any time. We're always happy to help, and we look forward to our next update in -- following the first quarter. So let's talk to you there. Operator This brings to a close today's conference call.

power company and the vast opportunity we're seeing across our North American footprint. So when paired with our disciplined capital allocation, we have visibility through the end of the decade to create significant shareholder value by maximizing the spread between our earned returns and our cost of capital. So in summary, and in total, TC Energy's value proposition is to deliver 3 things: solid growth, low risk and repeatable performance. So I'd like to take a moment to celebrate what's been transformational few years for TC Energy, and thank all of our dedicated employees for all the hard work that has ensured our continued success. By focusing on a clear set of strategic priorities that emphasize safety, operational excellence and project execution, we've delivered significant value. So let me start with maximizing the value of our assets. Through safety and operational excellence that ensures the highest level of availability, we've now delivered comparable EBITDA growth at the upper end or above our outlook for 3 years running. On October 1, we completed the spin-off of our Liquids Pipelines business into South Bow Corporation. This is a pivotal moment in the history of TC Energy, and it solidifies our position as an industry-leading natural gas and power company. We enhanced strategic alignment by integrating our 3 natural gas businesses under a single leader, and that has opened up new efficiency gains and opportunities to optimize cost and reduce risk while maximizing our EBITDA contribution through initiatives such as the 5-year NGTL settlement. Second, and turning to project execution, achieving mechanical completion on Coastal GasLink in 2023 was a milestone for the company, and I would argue for the country as well. And as you've seen this morning, we are pleased to have executed a commercial agreement with LNG Canada that declares pipeline, commercial in- service commencing collection of our tolls retroactive to October 1. As part of the agreement, TC Energy will also receive a onetime cash payment of $199 million in recognition of the completion of certain work and the settlement of all final costs with LNG Canada. Now we've incorporated learnings from the project into our capital allocation and project execution and commercial processes. And Southeast Gateway in Mexico was the first major project to be sanctioned under our revised process, and we are realizing tangible benefits. As you saw in our third quarter results, we expect to achieve mechanical completion in -- either by the end of 2024 or very early in 2025 now expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 11% below our initial estimate. Lastly, to ensure balance sheet strength, we've completed $7 billion of asset divestitures while retaining control of our most strategic assets. Through strong financial performance, and capital discipline, we are realizing approximately $2.5 billion of 2024 to 2027 capital expenditure reductions and we are on track to bring our leverage down from 5.4x debt to EBITDA in 2022 to our target of 4.75x by year-end. So all told, today, TC Energy is a much stronger company, and we are better positioned than ever before. Now let's go to energy fundamentals. And in my decades of working in this industry, I've never seen such strong prospects for North American natural gas and power demand. It's become clear that the world continues to need all forms of energy to meet ever-increasing global demand. It's about energy addition, not just energy transition. And the outlook for global energy demand continues to trend higher relative to previous forecasts underpinned by stronger natural gas and electricity demand, which together now account for 75% of the total growth in final energy consumption around the world. And North America and TC Energy have a pivotal role to play. We participate in the theme of global electrification through the delivery of approximately 30% of the feed gas destined for LNG exports. In 2023, North America became the world's largest exporter of LNG and emerging as a critical supplier of Europe and Asia, and export capacity is projected to grow threefold by 2035. Closer to home, our assets continue to enable coal-fired retirements, and we support increasing power demand from data centers and nearshoring. In total, we see North American natural gas demand growth of nearly 40 Bcf 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 2/28

per day by 2035. Now with the spin of our Liquids Pipeline business, we have now aligned our portfolio across these complementary business, natural gas and power, where the most significant growth driver is wide-scale electrification. TC Energy is the only energy infrastructure company with incumbency in all 3 countries on the continent, the only company that can deliver natural gas to all 3 critical LNG shore lines and the only one of our midstream peers with a significant interest in nuclear power generation. This is a competitive advantage that we intend to prosecute. You can see on the map on the right, the regionality of natural gas demand growth in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, and it overlaps with our footprint. Our assets directly feed the lowest cost supply to many of the strongest growing markets that creates a sizable opportunity set for us to select the highest quality and the highest returning projects going forward. On the left, you see that fundamentals in Ontario continue to underscore the need for safe, reliable and affordable power. And Bruce Power is a critical part of that equation, and we have investment visibility at Bruce well into the next decade. Now in several important ways, this slide exemplifies what we mean when we say our portfolio mix is both low risk and aligned to long-term fundamentals, 90% natural gas and 10% power with 7% of that 10% being in nuclear. Our cash flow quality is among the highest in the sector with over 97% of our rate regulated or take-or-pay contracts. This foundation means our cash flows relative to our peers are highly stable with little-to-no price or volumetric risk, and that's supported our excellent business risk profile, and it's also supported 24 consecutive years of dividend growth. Now by leveraging TC Energy's 93,000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines and deep capability in the power market, we've established a sizable backlog of $32 billion in secured capital projects. The majority of the opportunity we see remains in our core natural gas pipeline businesses. And you'll hear Stan discuss this in more detail, but of the forecasted growth of 40 Bcf per day in demand to 2035, TC Energy is positioned to compete for and win by our math, 23 Bcf a day of in-corridor potential. Our investment in Bruce Power, a world-class nuclear facility, also provides growth visibility through 2030 and beyond with our MCR program and our upgrade initiatives like Project 2030 Stage 3A, and that's a mouthful, that we announced this morning. Annesley will walk you through the significant upside we expect to realize through these investments. So the opportunities outlined on the right mean that we have more than what fits into our annual net capital spending limit of $6 billion to $7 billion. Make note, we are resolute in our capital discipline and our desire to remain within these limits. This is a high- grade problem to have, and I'll walk you through our approach. First, it's crucial that we ensure the safety and availability of our assets. And to achieve this, we invest about $2 billion annually in our maintenance and integrity programs. And given the regulated nature of our assets, we earn a return on and of approximately 90% of this capital. And this sets us apart from many of our competitors. Next, we're investing about $1 billion per year into Bruce Power to extend the asset life and increase capacity for at least the next 40 years. That leaves us with $3 billion to $4 billion of discretionary capital to deploy to the highest risk-adjusted returning projects in order to maximize the spread between our earned returns and our cost of capital. And how we invest this capital has always been grounded in energy fundamentals, and we will remain focused on regulated long-term take-or-pay contracts with investment-grade counterparties. Now where we've enhanced our capital allocation process is better risk sharing and cost recovery certainty during development. As well, we've developed a more comprehensive assessment of policy alignment, early stakeholder and rights holder engagement to ensure that our business will prosper through changing government administrations and at times, differing priorities among the 3 countries in which we operate. That's the benefit of that diversification. It's these principles that allow TC Energy to deliver low-risk, repeatable performance. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 3/28

When we say TC Energy is a utility like versus our midstream peers, this is what we were referring to. Now this next slide demonstrates how we've been high-grading projects to optimize returns to maximize value. We've seen an upward trend in the IRRs of our sanctioned capital since 2020. And with the work that we've done around our capital discipline and increasing our balance sheet strength, we expect our cost of capital to continue to improve. In 2024, our sanctioned projects have an average unlevered after-tax IRR of about 11%, and that compares to 8.5% a few years ago. Said slightly differently, our low-double-digit IRRs translate to project build multiples in the 5 to 7x range. And you would have seen that more in the 6 to 8x range just a couple of years ago. And as you've seen this morning, we announced over $1.5 billion of new growth projects that are consistent with this trend. These projects exemplify our forward focus on smaller brownfield in-corridor expansions that offer more compelling economics, shorter cycle time to cash flow and overall lower execution risk. And when you combine our $32 billion sanctioned capital program and our utility-like asset base, we have visibility to organically deliver an above-average comparable EBITDA growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2027. And I expect we will continue to deliver that strong performance beyond 2027. We'll continue to look for ways to high-grade projects to optimize capital expenditures and to deliver projects at or below budget to further enhance this solid low-risk growth profile. So what are our priorities for 2025 to achieve this? As you saw us do in '23 and '24, we have a clear set and a very short list of priorities. And I'm proud to say our team is delivering exceptional results. So it's no surprise that our 2025 priorities look very similar. First, safety in every step. Our safety performance is the best it's been in 5 years at TC Energy. Safety drives operational excellence, meaning our assets are available when needed most and will continue to meet growing demand. Maximizing the value of our assets will also stem from our ability to continue to find opportunities to optimize cost, accelerate our returns on and of capital, leverage technology to increase asset availability and enhance revenue. Second priority for 2025. We will execute our high-quality portfolio of growth projects, bringing $8.5 billion of assets into service in 2025 on time and on budget. Specifically, the Southeast Gateway project, which makes up the majority of that $8.5 billion is scheduled to come into service mid-2025, and this represents a year of material inflection for TC Energy. Third priority, projects will continue to compete for our capital, ensuring that we sanction the highest risk- adjusted return projects and maximize the spread to our cost of capital. By optimizing returns and remaining disciplined, we will continue to manage our leverage to an upper limit of 4.75x debt to EBITDA on a sustainable basis. And by delivering on these priorities, we expect to continue to achieve those 3 things: solid growth, low risk and repeatable performance. Thank you for your attention, and I'll now invite Stan to discuss the opportunities we're seeing in our natural gas footprint. Stanley Chapman Thank you, Francois. Good morning, everybody. I truly appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts about our gas business today. And I'd like to start by reinforcing the notion that we truly are unique amongst our peers and we're unique in at least 3 respects. First, we're the only one of our peers that has historic and extensive operations in all 3 geographies across North America, which provides us with a greater sense of diversity. Second, our best-in-class pipeline network is the leading transport provider out of several critical low-cost supply basins across North America, which play a pivotal role in servicing some of the best demand centers. This includes delivering 30% of LNG exports, 11% of power demand and direct connects to 8 of the 10 largest LDCs across the United States. And third, as you're going to see over the next few slides, we're unique in that we're the 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 4/28

only one of our peers that can offer visibility to over $28 billion of high-quality sanctioned and underway growth maintenance and modernization capital through the end of the decade that includes $8.5 billion of growth capital to be placed in service across our integrated pipeline network during 2025. So buckle your seat belts and let's get started. Discussions around energy transition are evolving to include discussions on energy addition as evidenced by the strong fundamentals supporting natural gas. As shown on the chart on the left-hand side, natural gas demand is anticipated to grow by over 40 Bcf per day or 30% between now and 2035. From a macro perspective, leading this growth on the right-hand table are once-in-a-generation opportunities around LNG exports, which continue to be the industry's biggest growth story, followed by strong growth in power generation. In addition, as supply grows to keep pace with demand, we're seeing the need for more supply egress projects to ensure producers have adequate capacity out of constrained basins. Of the 40 Bcf per day of forecasted growth, we're positioned to compete for and win a potential of about 23 Bcf a day, which is outlined in the middle column on the chart to the right. And I believe that because we already have 13 Bcf per day of those opportunities in development. And as a further proof point that this growth is real and translating into low-double-digit returns, today we announced 3 new projects, 2 relating to coal conversions and 1 relating to incremental storage capacity. And lastly, we'll continue to file rate cases more frequently to ensure that we are timely recovering a return on and of our maintenance capital expenditures, which keep our systems running and support the demand we're seeing for our capacity. So let's unpack these opportunities in a little more detail, starting with LNG exports. So given the heightened focus on energy security and reliability across the globe, LNG exports continue to represent the largest growth opportunity. Across North America, we see a tripling of LNG exports from 13 Bcf a day today to over 30 Bcf a day by 2035, which is anchored by more than a doubling of U.S. exports from 13 to 31 Bcf a day and further supported by Canadian exports growing from 0 to 5 Bcf and Mexican LNG exports growing from 0.5 Bcf a day to 3 Bcf per day. We're the only one of our peers with projects that are directly linked to LNG exports across Canada, U.S. and Mexico, which will allow us not only to grow our market share but to grow while the overall market is also increasing. And our diversification also serves as a hedge against regulatory policies that may otherwise slow the pace of growth in any one geography. We see 9 Bcf per day of growth potential for us, of which 5 Bcf per day is currently in development as evidenced by projects like our East Lateral XPress, which is destined for 2025 in service and our Gillis Access project, which is currently in service, but has plans for it to be further expanded in 2026 and 2027. These 2 projects alone account for over 4 Bcf of new capacity and have attractive build multiples. Our strong base of projects currently in development has us more than halfway to fulfilling our potential LNG growth opportunity. Despite a decade or 2 of lackluster growth in total power generation, which saw North American power demand grow by only about 3% from 2010 through 2023, gas-fired generation remained strong over that time, growing by more than 65%. Going forward, growth primarily associated with the energy demand from data centers and the continued opportunity from coal to gas switching will likely drive growth in overall power demand of over 20% from now through 2035, with natural gas growing proportionately. Bolstering the case for gas' continued growth is its competitive capacity-weighted economics with the EIA recently reporting that the cost for constructing new gas- fired generation currently averages around $800 per kilowatt which is 50% to 60% less than wind and solar, highlighting both the reliability and the affordability of natural gas. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 5/28

Page 6
The key for us, however, is that growth in power generation will not be uniform across North America. As a testament to the strategic location of our assets, of the 12 Bcf per day of potential growth, about 2/3 of that is located directly in corridors where our pipelines are located on the NGTL system in Canada, the ANR and Columbia systems in the U.S. and the TGNH system in Mexico. Other geographies where we don't have a heavy presence, such as California and New England are experiencing lower growth or overall declines in gas-fired power generation. So all in all, this is why our deliveries to power plants are up 36% over the past 3 years and why the potential for greater growth continues to be in front of us. Now leading the growth opportunity and the topic du jour across the power sector is data centers. While the opportunity is significant, we're still in the early stages of seeing exactly how this demand is going to evolve. Initially, it appeared as if the connectivity will take place behind the LDC meter, but for various reasons, we're now seeing a greater interest in data center connections to our mainline or directly with power generators. No matter how this growth plays out, the diversification of our assets positions us to capture this load. Should the load develop behind the LDC meters, we currently have direct connections to 8 of the 10 largest LDCs across the United States. Should the load develop as a direct connect with us, we're seeing interest in pockets of capacity that historically went unsold, and we're selling it now in advance of the data center build-out. And we're further optimizing our systems to find additional capacity that can be used to promote expansions, which could include a complementary gas and power offering in conjunction with Annesley and her team. And should the load develop off of a power generator, we directly connect to over 165 power plants across North America. So as you can see by virtue of the footprint that we have, we're generally agnostic to how this demand materializes. In terms of the size of the prize across the United States, which represents the largest opportunity for North that are planned to be constructed, we see total demand equating to a gas load of somewhere between 6 to 8 Bcf per day. Now as shown in the middle chart, 200 of these data centers are located within 50 miles of several of our pipelines. Based on that, we are currently in various stages of discussions for capacity to serve data centers, hyperscalers and others for up to 2 Bcf per day of gas demand in places like Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. So given the pace of these discussions, I would expect we could have precedent agreements for projects executed in the first half of next year with in-service dates starting as early as 2026 through the end of the decade. And in Canada, data center opportunities are starting to materialize. In Alberta alone, we now see over 5 gigawatts of capacity in the queue related to demand centers -- data centers. So while data centers are currently filling today's headlines, I don't want us to lose sight of the opportunity presented for natural gas-fired power generation to grow due to coal plant retirements. Across the United States, 225 coal plants remain in operation today, accounting for about 180 gigawatts of capacity, but 25% of them are slated to be retired by 2040. 38 of these plants are located within 15 miles of our assets with 9 gigawatts or about 1 Bcf per day of capacity slated for retirement by 2031. From 2025 through 2029, we're investing USD 2.4 billion of capital related to coal conversions that are either in construction or preparing to go through the FERC approval process. Examples of such include our TVA project, which is a small $30 million capital project but has a very attractive 3.5x build multiple and our ANR Heartland project, which is a $900 million capital project with a 6x build multiple. And today, we announced 2 new coal-to-gas conversion projects. Our Pulaski project, $400 million of capital investment with a 6.5x build multiple and our Maysville project, which is also a $400 million capital investment at a 6.2x build multiple. Both of these are sized for about 200,000 a day of capacity and have a 2029 in-service date. So while we're on the topic of power generation, I thought I'd briefly talk about Mexico. The gas fundamentals across Mexico are equally strong and are being driven by LNG exports, near-shoring opportunities 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 6/28

and the 17 new gas-fired power generation plants that CFE is currently constructing that will increase capacity by about 8 gigawatts, primarily across the Yucatan Peninsula. Our Southeast Gateway project continues to progress well, and we're tracking towards mechanical completion around year's end and on time midyear 2025 in service at a reduced capital cost somewhere between $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion. Our project and the 1.3 Bcf per day of new capacity it brings is essential in helping to close the poverty gap between Northern and Southern Mexico, while at the same time, reducing emissions as this new gas load will displace dirtier, high-sulfur fuel oil currently in use across Mexico. And before I leave the topic of power generation, I'd like to remind us all of the key role that natural gas has played in reducing emissions across all the geographies in which we operate. It has been and will continue to be a key tool to decarbonize the power sector as coal-to-gas switching reduces emissions by about 50% when providing electricity and by 33% when providing heat. So looking across our footprint, there's compelling evidence of this. Of the 9.2 billion tons of CO2 reductions across the U.S. power sector since 2006, 60% of those reductions have come from coal to gas switching, while only 40% have come from renewables. In Canada, Alberta's electricity sector achieved nearly a 50% greenhouse gas reductions between 2017 and 2022 by virtually eliminating coal. Today, coal remains the primary global energy source for electricity generation and has accounted for nearly all of the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2019. So this is yet another reminder of the need for additional LNG exports and projects such as our Coastal GasLink and the role it can play in moving away from higher emitting fuels across the globe as well as the role our Heartland and TVA projects play in reducing emissions across the United States. And before I leave this page, I'd like to note that in each of the geographies in which we operate, we've been able to leverage technology and innovation to reduce methane emissions by about 15%, while at the same time, growing our throughput and growing our EBITDA. Reliability also continues to be at the forefront of our discussions with our LDC customers as they're obligated to contract for and protect peak day needs, which are growing at an unprecedented rate. For example, LDC peak demand can increase by 50 Bcf per day or more versus average day loads. And over the past year, 9 of our pipelines have set new peak day delivery records. Storage plays a key role in meeting peak day demand and as well as in serving the backup to the intermittency of renewables. So given we're one of the largest natural gas storage operators across North America, we're going to leverage this expertise to further increase our storage position. As a proof point to that and in response to various questions that you all have asked me on prior earnings calls, today, we announced our Southeast Energy -- Southeast Virginia Energy Storage project. The project has a capital cost of about USD 300 million, a 5.7x build multiple and a 2030 in-service date. And more importantly, it will enhance our strategic Mid-Atlantic footprint and increase reliability on the heels of our Virginia Electrification and Virginia Reliability projects. So now that you have a sense of the demand side of the equation, I thought I'd shift over to the supply side. As demand grows by 40 Bcf per day through 2035, supply must grow by a like amount and pipeline constraints to lead the production center to demand sinks must be overcome. Our best-in-class footprint ties directly into 3 of the lowest cost supply basins, offering long-term production growth at prices of $3 or less. To ensure egress and intra-basin capacity for producers and gas process -- gas processors, niche supply projects, such as our Bison Express project, which is a $400 million capital investment at a 5.5x build multiple and the build-out of our multiyear system -- multiyear project on the NGTL system, which is a $3.3 billion capital investment will be critical. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 7/28

Given the 2,300 trillion cubic feet of estimated resource base across the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and the Appalachian basins, there are more than enough molecules in the ground to serve both core demand and strategically located regional supply opportunities. So putting all that together, I hope that you now have a better appreciation both in terms of quantity and quality of the clear visibility to growth we have through the end of the decade. Across North America, we have a diversified project portfolio, including LNG, power gen, energy reliability and supply opportunities, totaling over $28 billion with an average build multiple between 5 to 7x across our growth projects in the U.S. and Mexico. And I'll remind you that just 2 years ago, when we had our 2022 Investor Day, we referenced a 6 to 8x build multiple and are now demonstrating how we've been able to achieve better execution and higher returns for our projects. In Canada, which is 1 of our lowest risk jurisdictions and has some of the most competitive supply in North America, we'll continue to strategically deploy capital under their stable, low-risk regulated model to support the additional build out of the basin. And keep in mind that this is not an aspirational list. It's made up of projects that are currently underway and when placed in service between now and 2030, will generate solid growth, low risk and repeatable performance. So lastly, as we pursue flawless execution of our plan, we're going to rely on some of the same discipline and straightforward models that have worked for us over the past 18 months or so to ensure our future success. Though we don't often talk about it with this group, it all starts with safety. And 2024 is shaping up to have the best safety metrics we've experienced across our gas business over the past 5 years. Safety excellence drives operational excellence, which has led us to some of the best compressor reliability rates we've seen in recent history, which in turn serves as the foundation for the record deliveries we've experienced across our pipelines in all 3 geographies. Operational excellence generates trust with our customers and invites new origination and project execution opportunities, which in turn drives physical and financial growth. So all of these things, operating in unison while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation is what drives extraordinary returns for our shareholders and stakeholders, making us even more unique amongst our peers. So with that, I'll turn the stage over to Annesley and I look forward to addressing any questions you may have shortly. Thanks. Annesley Wallace Thanks, Stan. Whether it's the increasing demand for natural gas or power generation, the prominent theme that unites our business is global electrification. Fundamentally, our strategy is to develop safe, reliable and sustainable power and energy solutions that are consistent with TC Energy's value proposition and risk preferences. With the portfolio of owned and operated generating assets totaling over 4,600 megawatts of capacity, roughly 80% of our comparable EBITDA is underpinned by long-term contracts and incurred by our ownership in Bruce Power. Nuclear is the core of our Power and Energy Solutions business and a critical and complementary part of our TC Energy strategy. Our focus on safety and operational excellence centers on ensuring our assets are available to deliver power when it is needed the most and this extends to the team at Bruce Power, where availability in the low 90% range, and we can continue to improve the output from these units. Pursuing opportunities to maximize the value of our existing cogeneration fleet remains important as the demand for electricity continues to increase, supporting the need for both operating and new gas-fired generation. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 8/28

In addition to the Cogen fleet, the 118 Bcf of non-regulated natural gas storage in our portfolio positions us to provide reliable energy supply and contribute to stability in the grid that is increasingly powered by wind and solar. Keeping an eye on the evolving energy mix, we are developing capabilities and expertise in lower carbon solutions that ensure we are well prepared to respond to market shifts and deliver repeatable performance over time. These capabilities are twofold, perpetuate the value of our existing natural gas infrastructure by working to decarbonize our assets and drive value creation through future growth opportunities. As Francois stated earlier, natural gas and electricity drive over 75% of the growth in final energy consumption through 2035. Our portfolio of baseload nuclear and storage assets provide essential infrastructure and capacity to support that outlook. According to the Ontario IESO, electricity demand in the province is also anticipated to grow 75% by 2050, even higher than the 60% growth forecast in their planning outlook just earlier this year. Annual electricity consumption is set to rise from 151 terawatt hours in 2025 to 263 terawatt hours in 2050, largely driven by the industrial sector, data center development and a growing population. Importantly, if Ontario is to meet growing demand as well as its decarbonization commitments, these scenarios show an additional 18 gigawatts of nuclear power will be required. The current generation from the Bruce Power site and additional output from Project 2030 remain key elements in Ontario's energy plans as it provides generation that is both reliable and available in the short term. Beyond Bruce Power, we remain excited about the Ontario pump storage project and our continued discussions alongside our partners, the Saugeen Ojibway Nation with the Ontario government. The project can provide significant economic benefits to Ontario, and it complements it and enhances our position in nuclear. By leveraging long-duration storage in proximity to Bruce Power, we can limit the overall capacity required in the province by effectively storing excess electricity during periods of low demand and bolstering the ability to meet peak requirements. Given our existing investment, regulatory expertise and stakeholder relationships in Ontario's power market, we are favorably positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities. On the next few slides, I'll speak to the attributes that make Bruce Power a world-class nuclear generation facility and how our investment contributes to our ability to deliver solid growth, low risk and repeatable performance. The value of nuclear power has been increasingly recognized by customers, stakeholders, investors and governments, driven by its ability to supply safe, reliable, affordable and non-emitting power generation. Our 48.3% ownership in the largest operating nuclear power plant in the world with a power purchase agreement to 2064 for all generation from the site is a distinct strategic advantage in an evolving energy mix. Today, Bruce Power reliably generates about 30% of Ontario's electricity and remains one of Ontario's lowest-cost generation sources. Importantly, the team has delivered solid growth, low-risk repeatable performance over for the unit's 47 years of operation, receiving exemplary ratings by international industry groups through an unwavering focus on safety and execution excellence. And to emphasize a key point of differentiation and the low-risk nature of this investment, Bruce Power leases the facilities from Ontario Power Generation, has no spent fuel risk and will return the facilities to OPG at the end of its operating life. Bruce Power does more than just supply electricity. It's a leader in the production of cancer treating isotopes, as the largest producer of Cobalt 60 used to sterilize roughly 30% of all single-use medical devices globally. Bruce Power is advancing a project to expand isotope production of Lutetium-177 in partnership with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation at scale that is not seen anywhere else in the world. In support of this project, Bruce Power and the Ontario government announced earlier this month new infrastructure that will be built to complete early stage processing of these cancer-fighting materials prior to global exports. Next, I will cover our continued annual investment of approximately $1 billion and how we are increasing capacity at the site. Bruce Power's top focus remains delivering the highest level of reliability, availability and safety performance across all 8 units. A significant aspect of this work is the major component 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 9/28

replacement or MCR program to extend the life of the facility to 2064. Unit 6, the first unit to undergo major component replacement as part of Bruce Power's life extension program was completed in 2023 on budget ahead of schedule and with an industry-leading safety record. Unit 3 continues to advance on plan for both cost and schedule, with Unit 4 to begin in early 2025. As Bruce Power progresses through the MCR program, each refurbishment will add 300,000 effective full power hours equivalent to 35 years of operation at a 90% capacity factor. As we're paid for every megawatt of capacity, this also strengthens our financial performance. It is important to highlight the risk-mitigated nature of the contract. The contract prices adjusted annually for inflation and wages and adjusted prior to the asset management period and each MCR program. Through a long-term view, Bruce Power has enabled a robust local supply chain with 90% of spend within Ontario, generating $4 billion of economic activity annually within the province. This local capability not only drives efficiencies today but is highly advantageous to support future site developments. Beyond the ongoing life extension projects and given Ontario's commitment to advancing new nuclear with funds from the provincial and federal governments, Bruce Power has initiated a federal impact assessment for the Bruce C project. We are still many years away from a decision and to advance a new build, but this early work provides us continued optionality and a strong growth opportunity in nuclear that benefits from Bruce Power's strong management team and capabilities in project execution and operations. Project 2030 was launched in 2019, with the goal of achieving a site peak of 7,000 megawatts in 2030s, coincident with the successful completion of the life extension program. In essence, Project 2030 is equivalent to adding a ninth large-scale reactor without building any additional infrastructure, increasing its name plate capacity by upwards of 700 megawatts. The output from Project 2030 is also directly offsetting emissions in Ontario's electricity system. These offsets have been quantified and sold under Ontario's Clean Energy Credit program recognizing the important role that nuclear as a clean energy source. Today, we announced that Bruce Power is progressing with Stage 3a of Project 2030. Stage 3a makes modifications to the existing plan to provide incremental capacity of approximately 90 megawatts. TC's share of the capital required is approximately $175 million and will attract strong returns owing to the existing contractual framework. Investing minimal capital to optimize capacity across our existing infrastructure is one of the ways in which we continuously seek to maximize shareholder value. And over on the right of the slide, you can see the benefits we will derive from both the life extension and operate projects. TC Energy's equity income will nearly double from approximately $870 million today to over $1.6 billion in the early 2030s. Moving on, there are several ways the energy mix could evolve over the next few decades as the world seeks to meet growing demand. Over the last few years, the external landscape has evolved quite significantly and so has our strategy in Power and Energy Solutions. Today, our energy solutions strategy is focused in 2 areas: first, we will build capabilities that allow us to decarbonize our existing assets, enhancing and preserving the value of our natural gas networks. And second, we will continue to evaluate commercial projects, participating if and when commercial models align with our risk preferences. For example, we are working with Stan's team to build internal capabilities and technologies adjacent to our core natural gas business through piloting activities that will help us decarbonize our existing assets today. Currently, we're evaluating carbon capture solutions that can help to address emissions from our compressor units, which are the largest component of our emissions profile. We're also advancing a pilot for continuous methane monitoring, and we'll continue to assess opportunities for these solutions as the market evolves. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 10/28

While in the near term, we expect our capital commitments to Energy Solutions to remain relatively small, the capabilities and learnings we are developing are strategically important to both our existing natural gas transmission business and to ensure we remain aligned with potential future growth opportunities. As I stated earlier, nuclear is the core of our Power and Energy Solutions business and a critical component of TC Energy's strategy. Our investments today through the MCR program and Project 2030 are generating solid returns, and we have visibility to further growth opportunities in nuclear at the Bruce Power site into the next decade. We'll continue to optimize the value of our natural gas generation and storage assets, which are increasingly valuable in the context of rising demand for reliable and affordable electricity. And by building capabilities in low- carbon technologies to decarbonize our system and create pathways for future growth opportunities, we will continue to deliver solid growth, low risk and repeatable full performance. And I'll now turn it over to Sean. Sean O'Donnell Thank you, Annesley. Good morning, everybody. Batting cleanup. Today is my first Investor Day as TC Energy's CFO. And I wanted to start by saying that the 4 principles that we have on the screen that have made TC successful for decades have not changed. On a personal note related to the long-term fundamentals principle, I've competed with and sought to partner with TC on gas and power deals over my 3-decade career. As it relates to assets aligned with long-term fundamentals, and I'll offer a personal note. As I was considering joining the company last year, my own diligence made it clear to me that there would be no company anytime soon that could compete with TC's 93,000 kilometers of integrated pipeline and gas networks across North America or that had a world-class nuclear asset and power business with meaningful near-term growth potential that you just heard from Annesley. So the intersection of our North American footprints and rapidly emerging natural gas and power trend -- growth trends are what provides a solid foundational growth for TC's repeatable growth program. As it relates to our second principle on risk, I've been asked how our conservative risk principles get embedded into our strategy. It's a fair question that we challenge ourselves with every day. We embed our low-risk preferences by investing in our rate-regulated assets and by investing in assets that are driven by customer demand with high-quality long-term contracts and with balanced cost and risk sharing. Our third principle is to align our discipline $6 billion to $7 billion a year net CapEx allocation with projects that deliver the highest risk-adjusted earnings relative to our cost of capital. And our final principle, ensuring that we have the financial strength to execute upon our long-term plan. Everyone, literally everyone at TC has contributed to the significant financial improvements over the past few years, particularly the effort to reduce our leverage from 5.4x in 2022 to 4.75x by the end of this year. And by strictly adhering to these 4 principles, we have, and we will continue to deliver compelling shareholder returns. So today is an exciting time to be operating and investing in gas, nuclear and power, and we have the privilege to be doing each of those on behalf of our investors. So we'll get into the numbers here to give you a better sense for what our updated plan looks like. As you can see on the left chart, we've delivered a solid 8% annual EBITDA growth over the last 3 years. Our forward outlook is on the right. We expect to deliver $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion in 2025, which represents 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 11/28

another 8% percent growth rate versus 2024. Looking out over the next 3 years, we project a 5% to 7% annual growth rate with a 2027 EBITDA target of $11.7 billion to $11.9 billion. The next few slides will take us through each of the business unit's contribution to this EBITDA outlook. So starting here in Canada. We expect continued growth to our natural gas systems based on the strong fundamentals and the exceptional customer support for system expansion in Western Canada. As a unique proof point of how support of our customers are, we reached a unanimous agreement in July for the 5-year settlement on NGTL. The agreement begins in 2025, and we'll deliver approximately $150 million to $200 million per year increase in EBITDA over our presettlement levels. In addition, the settlement enables an investment framework to allocate approximately $3.3 billion towards a portfolio of projects with targeted in-service dates between 2027 and 2030. Supporting all of this investment is the low-risk nature of the rate-regulated cost of service model, where we earn a return on and of every dollar we invest into new projects and system maintenance. So in summary, Canada Gas will remain a critical part of our portfolio with its growth-oriented customers and its significant utility-like cash flows. Turning to the U.S. natural gas business. We have line of sight to a sizable project backlog, as Stan mentioned. From 2024 to 2027, we have about USD 4 billion worth of projects coming online. We are mainly targeting brownfield and in-corridor projects, where we're seeing build multiples of 5 to 7x and low double-digit unleveraged IRRs, as Francois showed. Those returns are driving our 4% CAGR through 2027 on this slide. We have been active with 6 rate cases in the past couple of years, as Stan said, and we do expect that the cadence is likely to increase to make sure that the spread on our new capital going into the U.S. portfolio is maximized. In Mexico, our assets form part of the backbone of the country's natural gas and import and delivery networks. Our pipelines are back by 25-plus year U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with the CFE, which is a BBB rated entity. With the in-service of Southeast Gateway in mid-2025, we expect EBITDA to increase to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2026 and 2027. SGP's in-service milestone will mark the very successful conclusion of our major greenfield investment cycle in Mexico. By year-end 2026, CFE will account for about 15% of TC's total EBITDA. And as Francois has mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we already have a plan to manage that customer exposure down over the next few years to approximately 10%. We have a few project milestones and a few strategies that we're working on to achieve that customer portfolio rebalancing. Heading back up north to our Power and Energy Solutions business. The advancement of the Bruce Power MCR program is the major driver of growth and asset enhancement in our power business. Annesley showed how Bruce Power's capacity will grow from 6.5 gigawatts today to over 7 gigawatts by 2032, when it's expected to provide meaningful contributions to our $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion EBITDA as the right column shows on this chart. Looking at 2027 in the middle of the chart, there's 2 things I'd like to highlight. First, EBITDA is flat from 2024 to 2027 because Bruce is entering a period of 2 units undergoing MCR upgrades over the next 3 years. However, partially offsetting the overlapping outages will be the increased capacity from the completed Unit 3 MCR program in early 2026 and the 3 price increases in the outlook period that Annesley slides highlighted. Beyond Bruce, we're increasingly finding ways to optimize our Canadian gas storage assets, leverage our commercial 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 12/28

capabilities in the U.S. and Canada and ensure the continued high availability that you've seen from our Canadian cogeneration fleet. Increased capital efficiency and optimization have been a major focus and long term win for TC this year. As these charts highlight, we've brought our net CapEx down by approximately 8% in each of 2024 and 2025. That is over $1 billion in near-term reductions. In 2026 and 2027, we've identified approximately another $1.3 billion in reductions, resulting in nearly $2.5 billion of capital savings in this outlook plan, with no material reduction in our 3-year EBITDA outlook. So together with our strong EBITDA performance, these savings have created the highest value path towards our deleveraging plan, which we'll cover here in a minute. So we get the question, what's driving these gains. And it's been a combination of several factors working in parallel. First, as Francois mentioned, the integration alignment of our 3 gas businesses has allowed us to capture efficiencies in every phase of project development from engineering design to procurement to field execution. And one clear proof point of these gains is the improved cost estimate and delivery of our Southeast Gateway project. But importantly, in parallel with those technical gains, the continuous optimization of our capital allocation process has also had its impeded effect. Projects now compete early and often through a rigorous stage gate process for the right to earn an allocation in our net $6 billion to $7 billion annual CapEx budget. The next slide will show you how that allocation process is shaping up for the balance of the decade. This CapEx dashboard highlights Francois's point that we have clear visibility on growth through the end of the decade for each of our business units. Equally important is that we're reducing risk by prioritizing smaller, repeatable and lower-risk projects. To offer a data point, the right chart highlights that our average project size at the end of the decade is only $450 million and that we're building a growth portfolio with balanced diversification. So while we enjoy visibility at the end of the decade, we continuously review the lead contenders for inclusion or removal from our pending approval bucket to ensure we're underwriting projects based on their ability to deliver the highest possible risk-adjusted returns. So let's turn to the funding plan next. Our plan requires $31 billion of funding over the next 3 years. We have $24 billion of cash flow that will fund the majority of that with the remaining $7 billion expected to come from the capital markets. Given the rate-regulated nature of our businesses like NGTL, Mainline, our 12 FERC-regulated pipes, we do utilize EBITDA growth as incremental debt capacity below our 4.7x leverage limit to optimize our return on equity given the deemed regulated capital structures that we work within. The key takeaway here is that our reduced CapEx and our dividend programs are funded by cash flow and new regulatory balance sheet capacity, meaning no new equity issuance is required to deliver this plan. This is where our organic deleveraging is coming from and what we believe is TC's optimal funding plan for the next few years. Continuing with the deleveraging discussion. This is a very important slide that shows how we've met our commitments to improving our balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. Over the past 2 years, we've executed $7 billion of asset sales, achieved better-than-expected comparable EBITDA and lowered our projected capital spend by approximately $2.5 billion over the next few years. 2025 does see a temporary uptick in leverage given the partial year contribution from Southeast Gateway. However, we are putting $8.5 billion of capital projects into service in 2025, which shows up in our 2026 EBITDA. And that's what provides us the ability to maintain our leverage at or below 4.75x in 2024 and from 2026 and beyond. And as Francois said, our commitment to balance sheet improvement is ongoing. We will continue to employ the same 3 debt reduction levers that have worked so well for us this year, growing EBITDA, delivering 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 13/28

capital savings and opportunistically rotating capital to capture arbitrages between our increasing M&A multiples in the market and our declining build multiples. So I want to spend one more slide on discussing leverage from a pure comparables lens to highlight why we think we have a balance sheet that is both fit for purpose and competitive. Bear with me here, you have to watch the screens. This is -- there's some animation. So this is a high-risk maneuver for a CFO. So stay with me here. So for those in Toronto, you'll be able to look at the slides. you have -- where TC sits today? 4.75x leverage -- and my monitor froze, so you can help me on this one. The 4.75x, 97% rate regulated. Now we're going to overlay our midstream peers to illustrate the relative differences of TC versus our peer group. On the left chart, TC is one of only 2 midstream companies with excellent business risk profiles, each with similar leverage levels. The right chart highlights a critical dimension that Francois covered, mainly that the quality of TC's cash flows are materially better than the peer average, given our limited exposure to commodity volatility or other low-quality merchant earnings. Now this is where it gets fun. We add the utility peer group for context. We sit on the left chart, we sit evenly between 2 peer group averages. So we rely on the analysis on the right chart to ask ourselves the question, what does TC's unique business mix imply mathematically about our optimal leverage level between our midstream peers at 3.7 and our utility peers at 5.7. Rest assured, we're not talking about migrating towards the utility leverage multiple, but the math here suggests that the midstream average is not exactly the right answer for TC either. We believe our business model with 97% utility-like cash flows supports maintaining the upper limit of our 4.75x leverage range for at least the next several years. I'm sure we'll have some Q&A. So in closing, I want to reflect on how TC shares in the South Bow have performed for our investors. As of yesterday's close, the combined value per share was about $77.06, which is better than TC's all-time high, which was reached in 2020. That is an incredible testament to both the quality of our assets and their growth potential as well as the market's confidence in our team's ability to operate these assets safely every day. So we are grateful for our investor support in what's been a tremendous year and which also marks the 24th consecutive year of our dividend growth. So I hope that you've all taken away from this morning's session that my colleagues and I are each highly optimistic about TC's prospects and our ability to continue building upon our track record of long-term shareholder value creation. So with that, I'll end my segment, and my colleagues will join me back on stage here in just a moment. But first, we have an outstanding video featuring our Southeast Gateway project and some of the team who are leading it. As they queue the video, I cannot overstate our excitement about SGP as it heads towards its in-service date. SGP's success is a testament to the world-class team we have in Mexico that is building this truly nation-building project. So let's kick off the highlight real. Francois Poirier [Foreign Language] We're very proud of you. Well done. So we have some time for questions. And please state your name and ask your question. Jeremy Tonet Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan. Just want to follow up, I guess, on the data center conversation. Obviously, it's very topical at this point. It seems like speed to market is the name of the game with many right here. And just 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 14/28

wondering if you could expand a bit more on how TRP's platform differentiates them here, differentiates you here. And particularly, I guess, the experience with intrastate pipelines versus interstate and how that could be a tool to expedite the process. Francois Poirier Stan, you take that one. Stanley Chapman Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I could give you a little bit of insight there. The intrastate opportunity is advantageous in that all things equal, you don't have to go through the FERC process and that in and of itself could potentially shave a year or 2 off of the in-service states. However, there are some things that are unique about it. What's unique is that you cannot have access to any interstate gas to supply intrastate service. And you have to have the markets obviously located within the state. So to the extent there was just making up an example, a data center in Louisiana that had a production source in Louisiana and was going to be served in Louisiana, that's a potential for us to consider. But to the extent it's going to traverse state lines, then you're an interstate pipeline at that point in time, you have to go through the FERC process. So it really is bespoke and unique to where the data centers are physically located, where the supply source is and how we could create that connectivity. Jeremy Tonet And then maybe just following up, I guess, on the generation side, given TRP's experience here across all parts of the energy value chain, just wondering what advantages that might present to you? Stanley Chapman We talked a little bit last night about us operating at the intersection of electrons and molecules. And that's one of the things that makes us unique amongst our peers in that we have both a gas and a power business. And I would just simply say that as we go through and continue discussions with data centers and various entities, we're going to be very good listeners in terms of what our customers want. And if there's an interest in an opportunity, for example, for our gas business to build a lateral and then for Annesley's power team to come in and build some on-site generation to provide electricity to the data center, we're open to that discussion. And again, we're open to it because we're the only one of our peers that can provide such a comprehensive service. Jeremy Tonet Got it. Makes sense. Very helpful. And last point, FX clarification. It looks like there's a $45 million pickup there. I guess you're at $135 million, spots at $140 million. My math would suggest $225 million uplift versus what you put out there, just marking to market FX to spot. Just wanted to see if that was the correct interpretation and if that's the same across every year going forward in the plan period. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 15/28

Page 16
Sean O'Donnell I'll take that one, Jeremy. Good question. The $45 million will show up in EBITDA. But as you just think about our U.S. business, we wind up paying most of our debt services in the U.S. So the better rule of thumb is the second bullet point on that slide. Every penny of FX is about $0.01 of earnings. So our net -- the real net from an earnings perspective is about $0.01 because a lot of that interest expense winds up getting paid and doesn't all show up in EBITDA or DCF. Theresa Chen Theresa Chen from Barclays. I wanted to go back to Slide 18 in the presentation related to the 23 Bcf per day of potential opportunities. Within this -- your outlook here, where do you see the lower-hanging fruit based on where your assets are situated and your incumbent position? And in the more competitive markets, whether by geography or by end use as outlined in this chart, how are you positioned against some of your peers and competitors as we've seen a number of open seasons and projects under development announced across the competitive landscape? And maybe tying that to Slide 45, the gray bars of potential CapEx to be sanctioned, how much of this opportunity in the 23 Bcf per day is represented in the gray CapEx bars? Stanley Chapman The strength of our origination opportunities really relies on the diversity of our assets. And I don't have the slide in front of me, so I'm going to do this by memory. But if you look at the 23 Bcf or so potential that we've identified, roughly 9 Bcf of that is related to LNG exports, 8 Bcf of that is related to power gen opportunities, either coal-to- gas conversions or data center opportunities. And then another 4 to 5 is tied back to LDC reliability and supply opportunities. So again, when I think about those, we have a competitive advantage in almost every single one of those. When you go back to coal conversions and the 9 gigawatts of retiring capacity that's within 15 miles of our pipe, that's a competitive advantage. When you look at our position in Louisiana, for example, and what we've been able to do and grow our LNG exports and projects like our Gillis Access, that's a competitive advantage going forward. When you look at the data centers and the number of data centers, 200 or so that are within 50 miles of our pipe, that's a competitive advantage. So that's what we're trying to leverage. And I think the point that I want you all to take away is that, we're not a one-trick pony that if there's a slower growth or a slower pace of growth in any one segment for any reason, we have more than enough ample opportunities in the other areas to continue that growth. One thing we're not going to have a problem with is filling up the $6 billion to $7 billion of discretionary capital every single year. I can't tell you exactly which projects right now or which buckets are going to be in there, but we're going to fill up the $6 billion to $7 billion every single year. Francois Poirier Just to add to that, and then, Sean, I'd like you to maybe touch on the sanctioned and yet to be sanctioned versus our growth pipeline because we're going to work very hard to fill the gap between those gray bars and that $6 billion line. But one of the assets we have that doesn't show up on our balance sheet is the brownfield expansion capability of our systems. We are not contemplating the need for any brand-new greenfield pipeline to prosecute 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 16/28

Page 17
and win that 23 Bcf per day of growth. And that brownfield expansion capacity is actually one of the scarcest resources that's available in the industry, and we have sufficient brownfield expansion capacity to actually execute our growth plan to the end of the decade. Sean O'Donnell Yes. I think the only thing I'd tack on to that CapEx dashboard, 2 things. Even that pending bucket, there's a pretty high commercial and technical standard that our teams have to meet to even be included in that bucket. So the -- what appears is white space between that pending and $6 billion, we have colleagues competing all day, all night for that kind of capital and plenty of pipeline to fill that. It's just a question of high grading, which is exactly the second point. You see a little bit of roll-off on that capital curve by '27, '28. That's intentional, right? We're in this phase of scrutinize every project and wait as long as you can before you actually commit to make sure you have got the absolute next best project to fit into the stack. So that roll-off is intentional, and it's going to be kind of a 2-year kind of filling towards the end of the decade, but we're well past 2030 in terms of the types of projects that our teams are actually out there developing right now. Maurice Choy Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets. Maybe sticking with the theme about higher gas demand, and I want to touch on the durability of the 40 Bcf a day estimate here. When you look at the drivers for this increase, is there a risk that if North America as a government, all the governments or as the whole energy sector, if they don't get their act together, some of this demand actually goes elsewhere globally. And can you speak to the landscape that enables or deters you from delivering this growth to meet this 40 Bcf a day? Francois Poirier Yes. Thanks, Maurice. I'll start at the policy level, and I'll ask Stan to supplement. The beauty of having a very focused portfolio where we have only 2 swim lanes, natural gas and power, is that we intentionally are focusing on businesses where there is -- there are differences in policy support from different political parties in each of the 3 jurisdictions. But largely speaking, nuclear and gas have bipartisan support on both sides of the aisle in each of the 3 countries. Processes to get projects approved take longer or speedier in different jurisdictions. But we have never had ever a natural gas pipeline permit application turned down. It takes longer than it used to because the diligence obligations around environmental impacts are more fulsome than they used to be. It costs more money to obtain a permit, but we factor all that in into our planning processes. And so the benefit of being in those swim lanes and being diversified across the 3 jurisdictions is wherever that demand comes from, we're going to be able to fill that gap. And in terms of power generation, I'll remind everyone that while we currently only own gas and nuclear, we have historically owned and operated or dispatched literally every single fuel type there is. So we have a long runway of natural gas growth ahead of us. We think it will speak for most of the capital out to the end of the decade. But to the extent electrification starts -- policy around electrification starts to pivot, we will gradually, over time, 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 17/28

Page 18
migrate our capital allocation more towards electrification. And that's why we're confident in our ability to meet that growth. Stanley Chapman And maybe I would just speak to the second part of your question in terms of what do I worry about or what could go wrong here. And one thing I think we continue to push for is permitting reform and permitting reform in several respects. One is judicial challenges that really don't effectuate any well-being in terms of us being able to build the critically needed energy infrastructure that we need, permitting reform in the context of I'd like to see FERC have more authority as a lead agency to help corral all the other dozens of agencies that are required in going through an approval process and permitting reform in the context of something to recognize the disconnect and correct the disconnect between FERC issuing an order that says a project is in the public convenience and necessity, only to have the states then hold up a key water permit. That process seems to need to be revamped such that the states will have input during FERC's NIPA review. FERC will then make a decision and then you go get your water permits thereafter. Maurice Choy Maybe just finishing off on a question on capital allocation here. You're clearly not short on growth opportunities, and you mentioned that you're keeping within the $6 billion to $7 billion of a limit. I assume you're not foregoing any of these opportunities. And I believe you made it clear that you're not issuing new common equity in the near term at least. So capital rotation, perhaps Mexico and/or Canada is a key lever you consider. Can you speak to the range of potential equity partners that you speak to these days versus, say, the range that you had, say, 3 to 5 years ago? Francois Poirier So we talked about, and Sean referenced in his prepared remarks, our desire to manage our exposure in Mexico. We'll be at 15% of consolidated EBITDA coming from Mexico after Southeast Gateway goes into service. There's still plenty of growth opportunities for us in Mexico. But what we need to be doing in sequence before we're allocating more capital in Mexico is we want to reduce our exposure down to that 10%-ish level over time. We've had conversations with many interested parties throughout 2024. It's very clear that we have the best perspective and view on completion risk of Southeast Gateway that wasn't going to be reflected in offers that we had received for joining us as partners. Every one of our jurisdictions, we have incumbency. To maintain that competitive position of a lead market -- leading market position, you have to continue to invest capital. So for example, on Colombia, if we did not have GIP as a partner, we would still be investing $6 billion to $7 billion a year in capital across the entire company. The benefit of having GIP as a partner is that we can stay within our net capital limit, but continue to invest in the system so that it maintains its premier leadership position. That would be the benefit of having a partner in Mexico. We're going to wait until the gas is flowing on all of our pipelines, the cash is flowing on all of our pipelines and probably in that late '25 or '26 time frame, be looking to work down our exposure. And then Mexico will be growing at a rate that's commensurate with the balance of our portfolio in that 10%-ish range. We have the benefit of the diversification in all 3 countries. I see Mexico potentially surpassing Canada as an exporter of LNG to the world in the next decade or so. And we're excited about wherever the LNG export growth 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 18/28

Page 19
is going to come from. And as Stan mentioned, LNG exports continue to be the largest source of natural gas demand growth going forward. There's been -- through geopolitical tensions, there's been a rebalancing of affordability, reliability and sustainability in terms of balancing those priorities. And I feel certain that the governments in North America want to contribute to global energy security. Energy security is geopolitical security. And so there is a strong focus at all 3 levels of government to ensure that the free and democratic world has access to affordable and reliable energy. And we're confident that North America is going to continue to play a leadership position in supplying the world with that natural gas. Praneeth Satish Great. Praneeth, Wells Fargo. Recognizing that you have $2 billion of spending per year of maintenance, $1 billion at Bruce. But for the remaining $3 billion to $4 billion of discretionary CapEx, can we say explicitly now that the hurdle rate is 5 to 7x EBITDA build multiple that you're seeing in the U.S.? Because I know you talk about risk- adjusted returns, but in the U.S., you've got counterparties that are offering 20-year take-or-pay contracts, which is basically a utility-like return. So in my mind, that seems like by far the best place to allocate capital. So I guess, is that true? And then in the context of that, how do you think about other projects like pumped hydro and things and just how do you allocate capital in general? Francois Poirier Yes. Great question. I'll start, and I'll offer my colleagues an opportunity to supplement. Praneeth, you're very close on the capital allocation. The one modification I would make is that in Canada, for example, in our regulated business, we do have an obligation to serve. So there is a minimum amount of capital that we have to allocate to ensure that we are growing receipt capacity as well as delivery capacity on the system to meet demand. So having said that, and that's what the multiyear growth program is intended to satisfy over the 5-year period. Once that baseline of minimum requirement of capital has been satisfied, then the discretionary capital will be allocated to the highest possible returns. And it stands to reason over the course of the next few years that any unallocated capital is most likely to be directed to the U.S. market where the risk-adjusted returns are highest. Now on things like pumped hydro, we have not yet had the conversation around what returns will be required to clear in our capital process. And we will make clear what those hurdle rates are that are necessary in order to receive capital. And Annesley, is there anything else you want to add to that? Annesley Wallace No, I think that's exactly right. I think as we look at the opportunities in the Power and Energy Solutions team, they compete directly with any of the projects that Stan's team is bringing forward. And Sean talked about this a bit in his earlier remarks. The visibility we have now to the pipeline at a very, very early stage allows all of the teams to understand what those hurdle rates will be. So whether it is down the road, a Bruce Sea, whether it's the Ontario pump storage project, whether it might be gas-fired generation in support of the gas transmission business, any of those projects would have to compete to get some of that incremental capital allocation.

And if I might add, Praneeth, it's such an interesting question. What you all don't see, what this leadership team and our other ELT colleagues that are in the room have focused on is people, process and culture. So our teams know exactly what they need to chase. They know who they're competing with. We have one scorecard for the entire company. So if a BD person in natural gas doesn't get an allocation because somebody else has a more competitive project somewhere else, everyone benefits. And so there's just a very strong focus around delivering the highest adjusted returns. And as you saw, the returns on the sanctioned projects has gone up every year since 2020. I would argue that as of where we are in 2024, our cost of capital is going in the opposite direction. So we really see the spreads between our earned return and our cost of capital widening over the next several years. Praneeth Satish That's helpful. Maybe just switching gears. When the South Bow spin was announced, you talked about a program to shave $750 million of CapEx. I guess the first question is, how are you progressing on that? And how should we think about that $750 million in the context of the $2.5 billion that you announced today? I'm just trying to square those 2 initiatives. Stanley Chapman Yes. Thanks for the question, Praneeth. What you're referring to is what we call our focus initiative. It's about fundamentally changing the way we do our work around safety, productivity and cost. So when we first announced the program, we challenged ourselves to come up with $750 million in value creation by 2025. And good news is we're at $750 million of value creation by the end of 2024. And you could quite simply think of that as roughly 40% or so is coming from capital savings, 35% or so is coming from revenue enhancements and the balance is coming from O&M cost savings. So we're not going to stop there. We're going to continue to go forward, and our team is evaluating right now what our goal is going to be for 2025 and beyond. But it's been encouraging and enlightening to see the team really take hold of this and make sure that we're focused on cash and our cash spend. And while a disproportionate amount of these savings are going to be ultimately flowed back to customers as we file rate cases and have toll adjustments, it makes us more efficient. It makes us more competitive in the end, and that's a good thing for us. Robert Catellier Rob Catellier, CIBC Capital Markets. Congratulations on the Coastal GasLink news. I just wanted to check in on the status of the indigenous groups and their 10% equity option and now that it's been declared in service, what's the process to -- for that to play out and conclude the -- whether or not they'll take that 10% option? Francois Poirier Thank you for that question, Robert. And as we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we are working very hard with all 72 communities with respect to developing a structure that increases that alignment -- economic alignment between us. Out of respect for that process, we are going to refrain from any additional comments until we have something that we can jointly announce to the marketplace. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 20/28

When we announced that in mid-July or late July, we already saw the progress we were making on the capital side and the EBITDA improvements such that, that transaction was no longer required for us to achieve our deleveraging commitments. But it was still extremely important for us to strengthen that economic alignment as part of our company's reconciliation with indigenous communities. That does not have to come in the form of a divestiture. It could come in many forms, whether they're relationship agreements or otherwise. So we're back to the drawing board and working very hard with the communities to come up with a solution, but it may come in a form that's different from an outright equity ownership interest. Robert Catellier I think you were addressing a GTL. I was actually asking about Coastal GasLink -- still let 10% equity options. Is that true? Francois Poirier Yes, absolutely. Forgive me for that. Stan, do you want to give an update there? Stanley Chapman Yes. The 10% equity option is still in play. We have to wait for the terminal to get in service, and then we have to go through a certain due diligence process. So that is yet to play in the future. Robert Catellier Okay. And then I did want to just clarify the leverage situation. I just want to be crystal clear here. So I have a 2- part question. As you've shown on Slide 47, the '25 leverage is at 4.9x, but 4.7 pro forma of full year of SGP. So the first part of the question is despite the pro forma number, are you still trying to reduce the actual realized number in '25 down to that 4.75 level? Francois Poirier Yes. Robert Catellier That's what it triggered. And then you obviously have the levers on the right-hand side of the chart here, which includes the self-help EBITDA capital spending. But you also still have -- and I imagine you will always have the capital rotation in your slide deck. But just with the amount of capital you've taken out with today's press release, SGP, I'm curious if you can get all the way to your deleveraging goal without actually making an asset sale at all in 2025 because my sense is your sell-down in Mexico probably happens when that's fully derisked. So that might be a '26 item. So is it realistic to achieve 4.75 million in 2025 without any asset sales? Sean O'Donnell 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 21/28

Page 22
Yes. Good question. Good 3 or 4 questions in there, Rob. So let me -- the rule of thumb that you all see in the deck, it's roughly a $200 million EBITDA target gives you about 1/10 of a turn. So this is really what we're playing with, right? With 4.9 to 4.75, it's $300 million of EBITDA, right, to just kind of put that in some kind of perspective, and we're going to be around $11 billion, right? So we've done a pretty good job the last few years of kind of establishing a relatively conservative target and performing well against it. So rest assured, we're not happy or done at 4.9. We just have to -- we have to own the data, right, that's what we're seeing without putting in a ton of optionality and with 0 asset sales. We do not budget for the arbitrage that we capture every now and then. So that's a long way of saying EBITDA and capital savings will be our path in 2025, not asset sales because the ingredients for the right asset sales, we will be patient to get the right kind of setup for asset sales. And look, it may be Mexico in late 2025, it may be 2026 because we will not rush asset sales just for the purpose of 0.05 for a leverage multiple. So anyway... Francois Poirier Just an additional point there, Robert, and thank you for the question. We announced $199 million payment coming from the joint venture partners at LNGC. That will show up in comparable EBITDA over time, amortized over a 25-year period. But the cash is coming in the door no later than mid-December of next year. So that cash is also another source of deleveraging. The best source of deleveraging is to not spend $1 in the first place, which is why you've seen that $2.5 billion of capital reductions be so powerful. And so to the extent we can outperform plan in 2025, that will be another source. So -- and then the other observation I would make in terms of the value of our assets. I think what the natural gas and power dynamics have demonstrated yet again are the 9 lives of pipeline assets and steel in the ground. And the value and the market value of pipelines is increasing and has increased significantly over the last 6 months, but interest rates haven't quite yet fallen off to catch up with that. So the intrinsic value of our assets to us at the moment is far higher than what we think is executable in the marketplace. And we think that monetizing assets in the current environment, it would be value destructive. Not something we expect you all as our shareholders want us to be undertaking. So we're laser-focused on improving our EBITDA and reducing our capital spend and looking for other sources of efficiencies to avoid any additional asset sales to achieve that number in '25. Robert Hope Rob Hope, Scotiabank. You reiterated the $6 billion to $7 billion capital plan for the next couple of years with a bias towards the $6 billion. It seems like you're in an opportunity-rich environment. What are the -- what do you need to see to move up towards that $7 billion range? Is it well below that 4.75 debt to EBITDA? So this could be more of a, we'll call it, '26, '27 target? Francois Poirier Yes. Great question, Rob. That's exactly it. We want to build some cushion below that 4.75. Pipelines take 3 or 4 years to get from sanctioning to cash flowing. And so you'll see a debt-to-EBITDA sort of float up and down based on the amount of time between the deployment of capital and putting your assets in the ground and then starting the cash flow. And so for us to creep up to the upper end of that 6% to 7% range, we want to build a little 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 22/28

Page 23
bit of a cushion below that 4.75 before we're pushing the limit there. And again, and I know some of you had this question last evening at our reception. The $6 billion to $7 billion capital program is not just a function of the financial math and financial capital. It's also our human capital. When we do -- we did a good hard look in the mirror a couple of years ago at our performance and project execution, when we looked back over the last 10 or 20 years, when our capital program annually was 6% to 8% or below, we performed very well on our capital projects. Above 10% is where you saw more variability in the outcomes. And so human capital is also an important consideration. And we will not undertake a larger capital program if we feel that it may compromise the quality of our execution because that's, I think, the fundamental pillar of us being able to create value. Robert Hope And then maybe switching over to the U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines. The 4% EBITDA CAGR out to 2027, how do you think that evolves towards the end of the decade as an increasing proportion of capital gets spent to the natural gas business there as well as seeing the higher returns? Is that 4% kind of the base with potential upside? Francois Poirier So I'll start, and I'll ask Stan to offer some comments. The CAGRs you have in the presentation today are based on the capital that has been sanctioned and unsanctioned, but we're pursuing in the gray boxes. To the extent we can fill that space between -- the white space between where we have sanctioned to the $6 billion, it's going to accelerate that growth. But in terms of the market dynamics, over to you. Stanley Chapman Maybe 2 things throw out for your consideration is, one, the unprecedented demand that we're seeing for our capacity, all things equal means that we should be able to see higher prices that we're realizing when we're selling our capacity up to a cap, recognizing that we are a regulated entity, and we do have a cost cap at the end of the day. So that in conjunction with the fact that we're starting to become really, really good at project execution over the long term, right? And project -- really good project execution is not about just taking advantage of any one opportunity. It's about what we've done with respect to aggregating our gas businesses under one leader, changing our governance procedures and going out and hiring a world-class expert to lead our project team going forward, all things which we've done. So I think the combination of the strong demand, creating higher upward pressure on prices and really, really good project execution is what we expect to maybe take us up a notch with respect to the CAGR targets going forward. Keith Stanley Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. First question, just the Canadian Gas Pipeline segment looks pretty strong. You have $300 million to $400 million of EBITDA growth. And I think the rate base and net income is flatter. Can you just talk about what's driving that much growth in EBITDA in Canada? Stanley Chapman 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 23/28

Page 24
Well, again, it's the strong demand that we're seeing for our capacity across all the jurisdictions. When you go back and you look at the NGTL system, for example, over the past 3 or 4 years, we put in 2 Bcf a day of capacity, immediately it was filled up. We announced our multiyear gas plan that we're going to add another Bcf of capacity over the next 5 years, expect that, that's going to be immediately filled up. Coastal GasLink when we go in service with the terminal, you're going to see another 2 Bcf a day of demand. So strong fundamentals for the demand, strong power loads, record receipts. It's just a proof point to the fact that the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is one of the strongest basins out there from a pricing perspective and that there's plenty of gas between it and the Appalachian Basin to fund the growth that we have going forward across all of our geographies. Francois Poirier And I would add to that, the settlement -- when we focused on the multiyear settlement with our customers on NGTL, we focused on cash flow and return of capital. So we have accelerated depreciation in the 5-year rate settlement because return of capital and velocity of capital is actually important when we have so many opportunities across all our jurisdictions. So even though the rate base stays relatively stable and net income stays -- has modest growth, we've seen a growth in EBITDA because of the increased depreciation. And that allows us to redeploy that capital more quickly into the highest returning opportunity. Keith Stanley Second question, just the AFFO growth of 4% to 5% versus the EBITDA growth of 5% to 7%. Can you just talk to some of the nuances that cause AFFO to be a little lower on growth? Sean O'Donnell Yes, happy to. The -- whether it's AFFO or DCF, they'll generally track kind of EBITDA minus kind of 100 basis points or so. And you have leverage fundamentally, right, and some partnership deductions, that's generally the discount. But we can -- we've got a great appendix for you for anybody else who wants that to kind of take you through all the way down to AFFO and DCF. But I'd lose the room if I went any further than that right now. Olivia Halferty Olivia Halferty, Goldman Sachs. Ahead of the $6 billion to $7 billion CapEx limit starting next year, another initiative you have discussed is pursuing fewer large projects at a time, even limiting to one large project to manage execution risk. Today, it seems like TC Energy's backlog is filling with more medium-sized projects. So I'm wondering if you can talk about the broader strategy in pursuing those medium-sized projects more broadly? And then second question, if there's room in your backlog to pursue some of those larger projects, what screens most interesting? Francois Poirier Thank you for the question, Olivia. So as Sean mentioned in his prepared remarks, the average size of our projects right now in terms of what's sanctioned is $450 million. We went there with intent. And the intent is a 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 24/28

Page 25
recognition of the lower risk that's inherent in a brownfield project in an existing jurisdiction. Our track record on going back to that 20-year look back we did on our execution performance is that when we're dealing in corridor with communities that are familiar with us on terrain that we know because we're the existing operator with project sizes that are in that medium -- small- to medium-sized range, our execution track record is impeccable. So when it -- when you look at larger projects, what would have to screen for us to be willing to sanction that? It would be impact on portfolio composition. So OPS would be on the larger end would, I think, fit in that criteria that you mentioned. It has to deliver returns that are competitive. We have to be comfortable with the risk. And for us to pursue something like OPS, we will bring in partners. We -- our intent on something like OPS would be to own as large or larger an interest as other partners, but not necessarily the majority of that asset going forward. So -- and then we would also adopt different contracting strategies. Typically, we have not in the past for large projects adopted sort of a fixed price turnkey contract. We would -- for large projects going forward, we will be adopting those kind of contracting strategies. Secondly, and this is something we learned from CGL, we're going to focus very clearly on the allocation of risk among partners in terms of for us not owning the cost and schedule risk on a project of that size. We don't need to adopt projects of a very large scale anymore. We have not only in the sanctioned projects that are in the presentation, but Sean alluded to the fact that we've got a whole backlog of development projects we're pursuing. Other than OPS, none of them are in that above $1 billion to $3 billion plus range. And we can deliver on our growth without actually going down that path. So we're going to stick to that to every extent possible. Manav Gupta Manav Gupta, UBS. Slide 39, looking at 2027, that's a very narrow range of an EBITDA for something that out. So just trying to understand, is that like a hard guidance or more like a target at this point? And then what are the buffers built in there, which could actually move you towards the top end of that 11.9% and maybe over 12%? Francois Poirier Good question. It is a target. But as you see, we have such crisp visibility on the projects. 2027 is not that far away, actually. And what you saw in our capital program and the projects that both Stan and Annesley, that's -- we're confident in that range, which is why it is that narrow. There's not a lot of variability on what we do between now and 2027, except for you, Rob, on how we're managing 2025. So we feel pretty good about that. The same levers that have worked so well in 2024 are in play every year for as long as we're in business, right? It is beating the budget on both EBITDA and the continued kind of just extraction of that $2.5 billion out of the capital program. That's -- those are the upsides, if any, that I think about as 2027 plus capital rotation and arbitrage, but we don't model that. Stanley Chapman Yes. And maybe just to double click on that a little bit further. I think of it in the context of what could provide further upside for us, it's the demand that we're seeing across all of our assets in the context of that demand means that we're doing less discounting across our systems, and we're getting more max rate transactions. That demand means that we're having less spoilage or less unsold capacity. So we're selling more capacity going forward. And then back to Praneeth's question, our focus initiatives to the extent that we continue to take 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 25/28

Page 26
cost out of the organization in subsequent years, that's going to give us a little more upward momentum, too. So now it's up to us to execute on those types of strategies. Gavin Wylie So I think we have time for maybe 2 more questions. Benjamin Pham It's Ben Pham, BMO Capital Markets. Thanks for providing ample time for questions. First question on your guidance, Francois, you have EBITDA, AFFO through 2027, and you've shifted towards FFO. Is that signaling that as a primary KPI figure for you long term? How do you think about EPS and... Francois Poirier Absolutely. So if you go back to our self-reflection and how to create more capital discipline in the organization, 4 or 5 years ago and earlier in our long-term incentive program for our executive we had cumulative EPS as the target. Given that as a regulated entity, we can use regulated accounting principles in our GAAP accounting, we created an incentive to maximize AFUDC, which runs counter to capital discipline. So we made a decision starting about 2 years ago to focus more on cash per share rather than earnings. Whether use AFFO or DCF per share, I know there's a lot of variability in how people define DCF. The reality is both earnings and cash flow matter in this company. We have an EPS target in our annual scorecard. We have a DCF per share cumulative target in our long-term incentive program. Where the 2 compete, we will always choose cash. That's why in the multiyear settlement on NGTL, we focused on accelerating depreciation and return of cash flow because that enhances EBITDA, which enhances our credit worthiness and actually allows us to allocate capital to higher growth opportunities. We do have partners, GIP in the case of Colombia. And we want to make sure that our cash flow per share generation because we always think in per share terms is visible to our investors and to analysts. So we think that AFFO given that we consolidate 100% of EBITDA where we have minority interest, AFFO nets out NCI, which is a more accurate reflection of our cash flow per share growth. And we always think in terms of cash flow per share growth must always be higher than dividend growth, and that will be the driver to maintain creditworthiness, maintain a stable payout ratio of dividends and provides the best visibility to our ability to grow the dividend over time. Benjamin Pham And can I follow on Bruce Power business broadly? Do you think that's an underappreciated part of your business? And is there any sort of -- you think where my question is going sort of spin out opportunity for that? Francois Poirier So I was going to pass this one over to Annesley, but when you talk about the spin, that's probably mine. Look, we are -- there are 3 things that are -- that create value in a nuclear business. First and foremost, it's excellence in management. We have the best management team, in my opinion, in the entire nuclear world, managing our MCR program. 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 26/28

Page 27
Second is you have a locational advantage. We have expanded -- we have an operating license already. The community is comfortable with having a large nuclear facility in its area. And the third is that we have a supply chain and we have a labor force that has surrounded Bruce in order to pursue the expansion program. That means that we have very high degree of confidence in delivering our projects on time and on budget. In the same way as Mexico where we've been in conversation with potential partners, and they have been valuing the construction risk, we think, inappropriately given our level of comfort, we are extremely comfortable with the execution risk at Bruce. And over the course of the next 2 to 4 years, we're going to be bringing a significant amount of those units online, adding 40 years of useful life to each of the units that we put back into service. We think that hanging on and being the owner and investor and continuing forward with the progress of the MCR program is creating a lot of value for our shareholders. Down the road once we get closer to the end of the program and if the expansion of Bruce C looks like a viable option, those are very large capital dollars. And at that time, would we contemplate bringing in a partner to share in what would be an even larger program going forward and crystallize some of the value of that investment? Absolutely. But for the time being we are very comfortable with the risk we are owning in exchange for essentially doubling the profit before tax that we're getting from Bruce Power between now and 2032. Patrick Kenny Pat Kenny, National Bank. Just a question on the cash flow quality profile given it is akin to your utility peers. I'm just wondering if you're seeing more and more opportunities to invest alongside your LDC customers? And perhaps if you see strategic value in extending your value chain more downstream? Francois Poirier Do you want to take the first part of that, Stan? Stanley Chapman Yes. Again, there are opportunities that are bound out there, and there are a lot of synergies between us and some of our LDC customers that we would love to explore when the time is right to do so. Francois Poirier Yes. In terms of down team integration, Pat. I don't see the need for it right now. We are -- as a company, we are long natural gas demand growth. We are very adept at managing our existing business. We have more growth opportunities than we can prosecute. I don't see us feeling the need to integrate downstream in either the LNG in the liquefaction space or in the LDC space. And to the extent the opportunities shift over time, maybe we would contemplate that, but it's not in the cards right now. Gavin Wylie Any other questions or we can wrap up there and head out to the lobby here to continue the conversation with our senior leadership team. Any other questions? 3/1/25, 2:58 PM CA$64.75 TC Energy Corporation (TRP) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=309162&tid=2658963&e=1899118533&ts=3316970&ref=l6cin7 27/28

Page 28
Francois Poirier So I want to thank all of you for attending our session today. We do have breakout sessions in the lobby behind us in each of our different business units to the extent you all have additional and more detailed questions to ask of any of our leaders. I want to thank our Investor Relations team. You all know that this is a very heavy lift putting this type of session together. I want to thank the folks at Lumi for hosting us in this facility. We are going to be following up with you over the course of the next few weeks. We are contemplating migrating to an Investor Day every 2 years going forward. And then the offsetting year, perhaps having an interesting site visit and what we're thinking about potentially for 2025 would be bringing a group of shareholders down to Mexico since that's becoming an important part of our business. So we'll be looking for your feedback on how you would feel about that approach. And we are good listeners. We're a learning organization, and we'll factor in that feedback into our plan. So thank you very much for your time this morning, and have a great day.

Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition On April 1, 2024, Pembina completed the acquisition of Enbridge Inc.'s ("Enbridge") interests in the Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen joint ventures (the "Acquirees") for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion, net of $327 million of assumed debt, representing Enbridge's proportionate share of the indebtedness of Alliance (the "Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition" or the "Acquisition"). Pursuant to the Acquisition, Pembina acquired all equity interests in Alliance, Aux Sable's Canadian operations, and NRGreen businesses, and an 85.4 percent interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations. The accounting for the results of the Acquirees changed from the equity method of accounting to being fully consolidated and incorporated into Pembina's financial results commencing April 1, 2024. Following the Acquisition, Alliance and NRGreen are fully consolidated into the financial results of the Pipelines Division, while Aux Sable is reported within the Facilities Division and Marketing & New Ventures Division. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. On August 1, 2024, Pembina acquired the remaining 14.6 percent interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations from certain subsidiaries of The Williams Companies for U.S. $160 million. The Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition was funded through a combination of: (i) the net proceeds of Pembina's bought deal offering of 29.9 million subscription receipts (the "Subscription Receipt Offering"), which closed on December 19, 2023; (ii) a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes (the "January MTN Offering"), which closed on January 12, 2024; and (iii) amounts drawn under Pembina's credit facilities and cash on hand. Refer to the "Share Capital" and "Liquidity & Capital Resources – Financing Activity" sections of this MD&A for additional information. The Cedar LNG Project On June 25, 2024, the Haisla Nation and Pembina, partners in Cedar LNG Partners LP ("Cedar LNG"), announced a positive Final Investment Decision ("FID") in respect of the Cedar LNG project (the "Cedar LNG Project"), a floating liquefied natural gas facility located in Kitimat, British Columbia, Canada, within the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation.

FINANCIAL & OPERATING OVERVIEW Consolidated Financial Overview for the Three Months Ended December 31 Results of Operations ($ millions, except where noted) 2024 2023 Change Revenue (1) 2,145 1,836 309 Net revenue (1)(2) 1,383 1,142 241 Gross profit 1,024 850 174 Adjusted EBITDA (2) 1,254 1,033 221 Earnings 572 698 (126) Earnings per common share – basic and diluted (dollars) 0.92 1.21 (0.29) Cash flow from operating activities 902 880 22 Cash flow from operating activities per common share – basic (dollars) 1.55 1.60 (0.05) Adjusted cash flow from operating activities (2) 922 747 175 Adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share – basic (dollars) (2) 1.59 1.36 0.23 Capital expenditures 242 177 65 Change in Earnings ($ millions) 572 698 (231) 88 34 41 (58) Earnings Q4 2023 Pipelines 2023 impairment reversal Pipelines earnings Facilities earnings Marketing & New Ventures earnings Corporate earnings and Income Tax Earnings Q4 2024 Results Overview Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased by $126 million compared to the prior period, which included the reversal of impairment related to the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline. Other significant factors impacting the quarter by segment include: • Pipelines: Positive impacts from the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, partially offset by lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline. • Facilities: Positive impacts from Pembina acquiring a controlling ownership interest in Aux Sable following the Acquisition, and higher share of profit from equity accounted investees ("Share of Profit") from PGI largely due to higher contributions from certain PGI assets and unrealized gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments. • Marketing & New Ventures: Higher net revenue driven by higher NGL margins, and the Acquisition, as well as higher Share of Profit from Cedar LNG largely due to unrealized gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments. This was partially offset by unrealized losses on risk management and physical derivative contracts in the quarter compared to gains in the fourth quarter of 2023. • Corporate and Income Tax: Higher income tax expense, driven by the recognition of deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023, which lowered income tax expense in 2023, partially offset by lower consolidated earnings. Additionally, higher net finance costs, largely due to higher interest expense, were largely offset by lower incentive costs. Additional factors impacting the segments are discussed in the table below and in the "Segment Results" section of this MD&A. 4 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 6
Changes in Results for the Three Months Ended December 31 Net revenue (1)(2) $241 million increase, largely due to the Acquisition, in which Pembina acquired a controlling ownership interest in Alliance and Aux Sable, resulting in a change from equity accounting to being fully consolidated on April 1, 2024. Refer to the "About Pembina – Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition" section of this MD&A. The fourth quarter of 2024 includes $306 million in consolidated net revenue related to Alliance and Aux Sable as wholly-owned entities. In addition, the Marketing & New Ventures Division saw increased net revenue from contracts with customers, largely due to higher NGL margins. There was also higher net revenue in the Pipelines Division, related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets ($23 million). These results were partially offset by unrealized losses on crude oil-based and NGL-based derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to gains in the fourth quarter of 2023, and lower realized gains on crude oil-based derivatives. Additionally, on the Cochin Pipeline, net revenue decreased by $40 million due to lower tolls on new contracts ($33 million), which replaced long-term contracts that expired in mid-July 2024, and lower interruptible demand during the period resulting from a narrower condensate price differential between western Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Operating expenses $53 million increase, primarily due to operating expenses from Alliance and Aux Sable now being fully consolidated, combined with higher integrity spending and higher recoverable geotechnical costs on certain Pipelines assets, partially offset by lower recoverable power costs. The fourth quarter of 2024 includes $52 million in operating expenses related to Alliance and Aux Sable as wholly-owned entities. Cash flow from operating activities $22 million increase, primarily driven by an increase in earnings adjusted for items not involving cash, partially offset by the change in non-cash working capital. Additionally, lower distributions from equity accounted investees and higher net interest paid, both largely a result of the Acquisition, further offset the increase. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities (2) $175 million increase, primarily due to the same items impacting cash flow from operating activities, discussed above, excluding the change in non-cash working capital, combined with lower accrued share-based payment expense, partially offset by higher current income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA (2) $221 million increase, largely due to approximately $105 million related to Pembina's increased ownership interest in the Acquirees and approximately $50 million from improved NGL margins and asset performance in the Acquirees, as well as higher NGL margins in the NGL marketing business and lower incentives costs. Additionally, there was higher net revenue of $37 million related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets and at PGI, and higher contributions from PGI, largely due to higher revenue associated with the oil batteries acquired from Veren Inc. ("Veren") in the fourth quarter of 2024 and higher volumes at certain PGI assets. These results were partially offset by lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline, combined with lower realized gains on crude oil-based derivatives. (1) Comparative 2023 period has been adjusted.

Other significant factors impacting the period by segment include: • Pipelines: Positive impacts from the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, and the 2024 period not being impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia that affected 2023. Additionally, there were higher net revenues due to increased volumes on certain Pipelines assets and contractual inflation adjustments on tolls. These were partially offset by the reversal of impairment related to the Nipisi Pipeline reactivation, and lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline. • Facilities: Positive impacts from Pembina acquiring a controlling ownership interest in Aux Sable following the Acquisition and the 2024 period not being impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage that affected 2023, partially offset by a gain on the recognition of a finance lease included in other income in 2023. • Marketing & New Ventures: Positive impacts from higher NGL margins and the Acquisition, higher Share of Profit from Cedar LNG, and higher other income due to gains related to Pembina's financial assurances assumed by Cedar LNG. These factors were partially offset by losses on risk management and physical derivative contracts, which included larger unrealized losses and realized losses in the period, compared to realized gains in 2023. • Corporate and Income Tax: Higher interest expense, and higher acquisition and integration costs, were partially offset by the net impact of the deferred tax recovery recognized from the Acquisition and the loss on Acquisition recognized during the second quarter of 2024, combined with lower general & administrative costs. Additional factors impacting the segments are discussed in the table below and in the "Segment Results" section of this MD&A. 6 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 8
Changes in Results for the 12 Months Ended December 31 Net revenue (1)(2) $803 million increase, largely due to the Acquisition, in which Pembina acquired a controlling ownership interest in Alliance and Aux Sable. The 2024 period includes $851 million in consolidated net revenue related to Alliance and Aux Sable as wholly-owned entities. Additionally, there were higher net revenues in the Pipelines and Facilities Divisions due to higher volumes compared to 2023, which was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires. Higher contracted volumes primarily on the Peace Pipeline system, contractual inflation adjustments on tolls, the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline, and higher net revenue largely related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets ($23 million), further contributed to the increase. Higher net revenue in the Marketing & New Ventures Division was driven by higher NGL margins and the impacts of the Acquisition, as well as lower unrealized losses on NGL-based derivatives. These results were partially offset by lower revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts due to larger unrealized losses on renewable power purchase agreements, combined with realized losses on NGL-based derivatives and unrealized losses on crude oil-based derivatives in 2024, compared to gains in 2023. Lower operating recoveries were largely related to lower power costs in the Pipelines and Facilities Divisions. Additionally, on the Cochin Pipeline, there was lower net revenue due to lower tolls on new contracts ($54 million), which replaced long-term contracts that expired in mid-July 2024, lower volumes from a contracting gap from mid-July to August 1, 2024 associated with the return of line fill to certain customers, and lower interruptible demand during the year resulting from a narrower condensate price differential between western Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast. This is combined with a nine-day unplanned outage at Aux Sable in July 2024 ($13 million) which also partially offset the increase in net revenue. Operating expenses $151 million increase, primarily due to operating expenses from Alliance and Aux Sable now being fully consolidated, combined with higher recoverable geotechnical costs and higher integrity spending. The 2024 period includes $159 million in consolidated operating expenses related to Alliance and Aux Sable as wholly-owned entities. These increases were partially offset by lower recoverable power costs, and lower costs in the Pipelines Division in 2024 compared to 2023, as 2023 was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage. Cash flow from operating activities $579 million increase, primarily driven by an increase in earnings adjusted for items not involving cash, the change in non-cash working capital, and an increase in payments collected through contract liabilities. This is partially offset by lower distributions from equity accounted investees and higher net interest paid, both largely a result of the Acquisition, as well as higher taxes paid and share-based payments. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities (2) $619 million increase, primarily due to the same items impacting cash flow from operating activities, discussed above, excluding the change in non-cash working capital, taxes paid, and share-based payments, combined with lower current income tax expense. The increase was partially offset by higher accrued share-based payment expense, distributions to non-controlling interest, and higher preferred dividends paid. Adjusted EBITDA (2) $584 million increase, largely due to approximately $230 million related to Pembina's increased ownership interest in the Acquirees and approximately $210 million from improved NGL margins and asset performance in the Acquirees. Additional contributors included higher net revenue and volumes on certain of Pembina's Pipelines and Facilities assets compared to 2023, which was affected by the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires, as well as higher NGL margins in the NGL marketing business and increased marketed volumes in the Marketing & New Ventures Division. Higher adjusted EBITDA from PGI also contributed to the increase, largely due to higher revenue associated with the oil batteries acquired from Veren in the fourth quarter of 2024 and higher volumes at certain PGI assets. Other factors included higher contracted volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, contractual inflation adjustments on tolls, the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline, and a $37 million increase in net revenue related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets and at PGI. These results were partially offset by realized losses on NGL-based derivatives compared to gains in 2023, and lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline, combined with a change to other expense in the Facilities Division, compared to other income in 2023, which included a gain on the recognition of a finance lease, and a nine-day unplanned outage at Aux Sable in July 2024.

3. SEGMENT RESULTS Business Overview The Pipelines Division provides customers with pipeline transportation, terminalling, and storage in key market hubs in Canada and the United States for crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas. The Pipelines Division manages pipeline transportation capacity of 3.0 mmboe/d (1) and above ground storage capacity of approximately 10 mmbbls (1) within its conventional, oil sands and heavy oil, and transmission assets. The conventional assets include strategically located pipelines and terminalling hubs that gather and transport light and medium crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids from western Alberta and northeast British Columbia to downstream pipelines and processing facilities in the Edmonton, Alberta area. The oil sands and heavy oil assets transport heavy and synthetic crude oil produced within Alberta to the Edmonton, Alberta area and offer associated storage and terminalling. The transmission assets transport natural gas, ethane and condensate throughout Canada and the United States on long haul pipelines linking various key market hubs. In addition, the Pipelines Division assets provide linkages to Pembina's Facilities Division assets across North America, enhancing flexibility and optionality in our customer service offerings. Together, these assets supply products from hydrocarbon producing regions to refineries, fractionators and market hubs in Alberta, British Columbia, and Illinois, as well as other regions throughout North America. The Facilities Division includes infrastructure that provides Pembina's customers with natural gas, condensate and NGL services. Through its wholly-owned assets and its interest in PGI, Pembina's natural gas gathering and processing facilities are strategically positioned in active, liquids-rich areas of the WCSB and Williston Basin and may be serviced by the Company's other businesses. Pembina provides sweet and sour gas gathering, compression, condensate stabilization, and both shallow cut and deep cut gas processing services with a total capacity of approximately 6.7 bcf/d (1) for its customers. Condensate and NGL extracted at virtually all Canadian-based facilities have access to transportation on Pembina's pipelines. In addition, all NGL transported along the Alliance Pipeline are extracted through the Channahon Facility at the terminus. The Facilities Division includes approximately 430 mbpd (1) of NGL fractionation capacity, 21 mmbbls (1) of cavern storage capacity, various oil batteries, associated pipeline and rail terminalling facilities and a liquefied propane export facility on Canada's West Coast. These facilities are accessible to Pembina's other strategically-located assets and pipeline systems, providing customers with flexibility and optionality to access a comprehensive suite of services to enhance the value of their hydrocarbons. In addition, Pembina owns a bulk marine import/export terminal in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Marketing & New Ventures Division leverages Pembina's integrated value chain and existing network of pipelines, facilities, and energy infrastructure assets to maximize the value of hydrocarbon liquids and natural gas originating in the basins where the Company operates. Pembina pursues the creation of new markets, and further enhances existing markets, to support both the Company's and its customers' business interests. In particular, Pembina seeks to identify opportunities to connect hydrocarbon production to new demand locations through the development of infrastructure. Within the Marketing & New Ventures Division, Pembina undertakes value-added commodity marketing activities, including buying and selling products (natural gas, ethane, propane, butane, condensate, crude oil, electricity, and carbon credits), commodity arbitrage, and optimizing storage opportunities. The marketing business enters into contracts for capacity on both Pembina's and third-party infrastructure, handles proprietary and customer volumes and aggregates production for onward sale. Through this infrastructure capacity, including Pembina's Prince Rupert Terminal, as well as utilizing the Company's expansive rail fleet and logistics capabilities, Pembina's marketing business adds incremental value to the commodities by accessing high value markets across North America and globally. The Marketing & New Ventures Division is also responsible for the development of new large-scale, or value chain extending projects, including those that provide enhanced access to global markets and support a transition to a lower-carbon economy. The Marketing & New Ventures Division includes Pembina's interest in the Cedar LNG Project, a liquified natural gas ("LNG") export facility currently under construction. Additionally, Pembina is pursuing opportunities associated with low-carbon commodities and large-scale greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions reductions.

The fourth quarter of 2024 includes $227 million in net revenue related to Alliance as a wholly-owned entity. Additionally, higher revenue related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets ($23 million), and increasing volumes on the Nipisi Pipeline following its reactivation in October 2023, also contributed to the increase in net revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline due to lower tolls on new contracts ($33 million), which replaced long-term contracts that expired in mid-July 2024, and lower interruptible demand during the period resulting from a narrower condensate price differential between western Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Net revenues on the Peace Pipeline system were consistent as higher contracted volumes and contractual inflation adjustments on tolls were largely offset by earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue during the first half of 2024, as well as net loss allowance. Operating expenses (1) Increase largely due to the Acquisition. The fourth quarter of 2024 includes $54 million in operating expenses related to Alliance as a wholly-owned entity. Depreciation and amortization included in gross profit Higher largely due to the Acquisition, combined with the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline, partially offset by fewer asset retirements compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Share of profit from equity accounted investees Following the Acquisition on April 1, 2024, the results from Alliance are no longer accounted for in Share of Profit and are now being fully consolidated. Earnings Decrease largely due to the reversal of impairment related to the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline which increased revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 by $231 million, combined with lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline. This was partially offset by the net impacts of the Acquisition, higher revenue related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets, and increasing volumes on the Nipisi Pipeline following its reactivation in October 2023. Adjusted EBITDA (2) Increase largely due to the net impacts of the Acquisition, combined with higher revenue related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets, higher adjusted EBITDA from Alliance driven by higher demand on seasonal contracts, and increasing volumes on the Nipisi Pipeline following its reactivation in October 2023. This was partially offset by lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline. Volumes (3) Higher largely due to the Acquisition, discussed above, combined with the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline. The increase was partially offset by lower volumes on the Peace Pipeline system due to earlier recognition of take-or- pay deferred revenue in the first half of 2024, which more than offset the increase from higher contracted volumes. Additionally, lower volumes on the Cochin Pipeline were largely due to lower interruptible demand during the period resulting from a narrower condensate price differential between western Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The 2024 period includes $622 million in net revenue related to Alliance as a wholly-owned entity. Also contributing to the increase in net revenue were contractual inflation adjustments on tolls, higher volumes compared to 2023, which was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires, and higher contracted volumes on the Peace Pipeline system. The reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline, and higher net revenue related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets ($23 million) also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline due to lower tolls on new contracts ($54 million), which replaced long-term contracts that expired in mid-July 2024, lower volumes from a contracting gap from mid-July to August 1, 2024 associated with the return of line fill to certain customers, and lower interruptible demand during the period resulting from a narrower condensate price differential between western Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Lower recoverable power costs and project costs also contributed to the decrease in net revenue. Operating expenses (1) Increase largely due to the Acquisition, discussed above, higher recoverable geotechnical costs, and higher integrity spending. The 2024 period includes $156 million in operating expenses related to Alliance as a wholly- owned entity. These increases are partially offset by lower recoverable power costs resulting from a lower power pool price, and lower costs as 2023 was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage. Depreciation and amortization included in gross profit Higher largely due to the Acquisition, discussed above, combined with the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline, partially offset by fewer asset retirements in 2024 compared to 2023. Share of profit from equity accounted investees Following the Acquisition on April 1, 2024, the results from Alliance are no longer accounted for in Share of Profit and are now being fully consolidated. Earnings Higher largely due to the net impacts of the Acquisition, and no impacts in 2024 from the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires, which affected 2023. Higher net revenue and volumes, primarily on the Peace Pipeline system and on the Nipisi Pipeline, contractual inflation adjustments on tolls, and higher net revenue related to the timing of capital recovery recognition on certain Pipelines assets also contributed to the increase. These results were partially offset by the reversal of impairment related to the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2023 ($231 million), and lower net revenue and volumes on the Cochin Pipeline in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA (2) Increase largely due to the same factors impacting earnings, discussed above, excluding the reversal of impairment. Higher demand on seasonal contracts also contributed to higher adjusted EBITDA from Alliance. Volumes (3) Higher largely due to the Acquisition, and the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline, combined with higher volumes compared to 2023 which was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires, and higher volumes on the Peace Pipeline system due to higher contracted volumes. The increase was partially offset by lower volumes on the Cochin Pipeline resulting from a contracting gap from mid-July to August 1, 2024 associated with the return of line fill to certain customers, and lower interruptible demand resulting from a narrower condensate price differential between western Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The fourth quarter of 2024 includes $82 million in revenue related to Aux Sable as a wholly-owned entity. Operating expenses (1) Increase largely due to the Acquisition, discussed above. The fourth quarter of 2024 includes $50 million in operating expenses related to Aux Sable as a wholly-owned entity. Share of profit from equity accounted investees Increase due to higher contributions from certain PGI assets, driven by higher revenue associated with the oil batteries acquired from Veren in the fourth quarter of 2024, higher volumes at certain PGI assets, and the timing of revenue recognition on capital recoveries ($14 million). Additionally, PGI recognized unrealized gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to losses in the fourth quarter of 2023. These results were partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher other expense related to asset disposals. Earnings Increase largely due to the net impacts of the Acquisition, and higher Share of Profit from PGI, discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA (2) Higher largely due to the net impacts of the Acquisition, discussed above, and higher net revenue from PGI, driven by higher revenue associated with the oil batteries acquired from Veren in the fourth quarter of 2024, higher volumes at certain PGI assets, and the timing of revenue recognition on capital recoveries. Included in adjusted EBITDA is $193 million (2023: $179 million) related to PGI. Volumes (3) Increase primarily due to the volumes now being recognized at Aux Sable following the Acquisition. Volumes at PGI were consistent with prior period as higher interruptible and contracted volumes on certain PGI assets were largely offset by contract expirations in 2024.

The 2024 period includes $223 million in revenue related to Aux Sable as a wholly-owned entity. Additionally, there were no impacts in 2024 from the Northern Pipeline system outage that affected the same period in 2023, which further contributed to the increase in revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower recoverable power and fuel costs primarily at the Redwater Complex. Operating expenses (1) Increase largely due to the Acquisition, discussed above, partially offset by lower recoverable power and fuel costs. The 2024 period includes $136 million in operating expenses related to Aux Sable as a wholly-owned entity. Depreciation and amortization included in gross profit Higher largely due to the Acquisition, discussed above. Share of profit from equity accounted investees Consistent with prior period. Higher contributions from certain PGI assets, driven by higher revenue associated with the oil batteries acquired from Veren in the fourth quarter of 2024, higher volumes, and the timing of revenue recognition on capital recoveries ($14 million), which were more than offset by higher income tax expense and larger unrealized losses recognized by PGI on interest rate derivative financial instruments in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Earnings Increase largely due to the net impacts of the Acquisition, and no impacts in 2024 from the Northern Pipeline system outage. The increase was partially offset by a $16 million gain on the recognition of a finance lease included as other income in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA (2) Increase largely due to the net impacts of the Acquisition, and higher adjusted EBITDA from PGI, largely due to higher revenue associated with the oil batteries acquired from Veren in the fourth quarter of 2024, higher volumes at certain PGI assets, and the timing of revenue recognition on capital recoveries. Additionally, there were no impacts in 2024 from the Northern Pipeline system outage, which affected 2023. These increases were partially offset by a $16 million gain on the recognition of a finance lease included as other income in 2023. Included in adjusted EBITDA is $709 million (2023: $657 million) related to PGI. Volumes (3) Increase primarily due to the volumes now being recognized at Aux Sable following the Acquisition, and higher volumes compared to 2023, which was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage, combined with higher interruptible and contracted volumes on certain PGI assets. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes largely due to a planned outage and a rail strike at the Redwater Complex in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in volume curtailments.

Projects & New Developments (1) Facilities continues to build-out its natural gas and NGL processing and fractionation assets to service customer demand. The following outlines the projects and new developments within Facilities: RFS IV Capital Budget: $525 million In-service Date (2) : First half of 2026 Status: On time, on updated budget RFS IV is a 55,000 bpd propane-plus fractionator at the existing Redwater fractionation and storage complex (the "Redwater Complex"). The project includes additional rail loading capacity and will leverage the design, engineering, and operating best practices of the existing facilities at the Redwater Complex. With the addition of RFS IV, the fractionation capacity at the Redwater Complex will total 256,000 bpd. As previously announced, the estimated project cost has been revised to $525 million (previously $460 million), reflecting project scope changes as well as higher equipment, material and labour costs in light of growing Alberta construction activity. Pembina has entered into a lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction agreement in respect of the project, for more than 70 percent of the project cost. Fabrication and construction activities continued for the facility in the fourth quarter of 2024, while piling and foundation work was completed for both the facility and infrastructure. Wapiti Expansion Capital Budget: $140 million (net to Pembina) In-service Date (2) : First half of 2026 Status: On time, on budget PGI is developing an expansion that will increase natural gas processing capacity at the Wapiti Plant by 115 mmcf/d (gross to PGI). The expansion opportunity is driven by strong customer demand supported by growing Montney production and is fully underpinned by long-term, take-or-pay contracts. The project includes a new sales gas pipeline and other related infrastructure. During the fourth quarter of 2024, engineering and equipment fabrication progressed and early works construction commenced. K3 Cogeneration Facility Capital Budget: $70 million (net to Pembina) In-service Date (2) : First half of 2026 Status: On time, on budget PGI is developing a 28 MW cogeneration facility at its K3 Plant, which is expected to reduce overall operating costs by providing power and heat to the gas processing facility, while reducing customers' exposure to power prices. The K3 Cogeneration Facility is expected to fully supply the K3 Plant's power requirements, with excess power sold to the grid at market rates. Further, through the utilization of the cogeneration waste heat and the low-emission power generated, the project is expected to contribute to a reduction in annual emissions compliance costs at the K3 Plant. During the fourth quarter of 2024, early works construction commenced. Pembina announced the closing of PGI's acquisition of a 50 percent working interest in Whitecap Resources Inc.'s ("Whitecap") 15-07 Kaybob Complex effective December 31, 2024. Concurrent with the acquisition, PGI agreed to support future infrastructure development for Whitecap's Lator area development, including a new battery and gathering laterals (the "Lator Infrastructure"), which PGI will own. PGI anticipates funding up to $400 million ($240 million net to Pembina) for the battery and gathering laterals within the first phase of the Lator Infrastructure, with all gas volumes flowing to PGI's Musreau facility upon startup in late 2026/early 2027, supporting long-term plant utilization. Pembina announced the closing of PGI's transaction with Veren, which includes the acquisition of Veren's Gold Creek and Karr area oil batteries and support for future infrastructure development effective October 9, 2024. As part of the transaction, PGI committed to fund capital up to $300 million ($180 million net to Pembina) for future battery and gathering infrastructure in the Gold Creek and Karr areas.

Higher NGL net revenue from contracts with customers was largely due to higher NGL margins and the Acquisition, in which Pembina acquired a controlling ownership interest in Aux Sable. The fourth quarter of 2024 includes $49 million in net revenue related to Aux Sable as a wholly-owned entity. Net revenue from crude oil sales was largely consistent with prior period as higher volumes were partially offset by lower prices. Higher NGL net revenue from contracts with customers was offset by lower revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts largely due to unrealized losses on crude oil-based and NGL-based derivatives compared to gains in the fourth quarter of 2023, combined with lower realized gains on crude oil- based derivatives, primarily due to changes in pricing. The fourth quarter of 2024 includes unrealized losses on commodity-related derivatives of $41 million (2023: $46 million gain) and realized gains on commodity- related derivatives of $52 million (2023: $66 million gain). Share of profit from equity accounted investees Increase largely due to unrealized gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments recognized by Cedar LNG, which were entered into in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by foreign exchange losses. Share of Profit in the fourth quarter of 2023 relates to the results from Aux Sable. Following the Acquisition on April 1, 2024, the results from Aux Sable are no longer accounted for in Share of Profit and are now being fully consolidated. Earnings Increase primarily due to higher Share of Profit from Cedar LNG and higher net revenue from contracts with customers, which were largely offset by lower revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts, discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA (3) Higher largely due to higher NGL margins and the impacts of the Acquisition, partially offset by lower realized gains on commodity-related derivatives, discussed above. Crude oil sales volumes (4) Primarily higher due to increased blending opportunities driven by favorable price differentials in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. NGL sales volumes (4) Increase primarily due to higher ethane, propane, and butane sales largely due to the increase in Pembina's ownership interest in Aux Sable.

These increases were partially offset by a nine-day unplanned outage at Aux Sable in July 2024 ($13 million). The 2024 period includes $139 million in net revenue related to Aux Sable as a wholly-owned entity. Net revenue from crude oil sales was largely consistent with prior period. Lower revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts was primarily due to larger unrealized losses on renewable power purchase agreements largely due to a decline in forward power prices, combined with unrealized losses on crude oil-based derivatives and realized losses on NGL-based derivatives in 2024, compared to gains in 2023. These results were partially offset by lower unrealized losses on NGL- based derivatives, and larger realized gains on crude oil-based derivatives. The 2024 period includes unrealized losses on commodity-related derivatives of $170 million (2023: $32 million loss) and realized gains on commodity-related derivatives of $241 million (2023: $315 million gain). Operating expenses (1) Increase due to certain freight costs previously included in cost of goods sold. Share of profit (loss) from equity accounted investees Increase largely due to unrealized gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments recognized by Cedar LNG, which were entered into in the third quarter of 2024, as well as strong results from Aux Sable in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by foreign exchange losses in Cedar LNG. Following the Acquisition on April 1, 2024, the results from Aux Sable are no longer accounted for in Share of Profit and are now being fully consolidated. The loss in 2023 largely relates to provisions recognized by Aux Sable. Depreciation and amortization included in gross profit Increase largely due to a change in the expected useful life of certain intangible assets. Earnings Increase largely due to higher Share of Profit, higher net revenue,discussed above, and gains associated with the derecognition of the provision related to financial assurances provided by Pembina which were assumed by Cedar LNG following the positive FID in June 2024, partially offset by higher depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA (3) Increase mainly from higher NGL margins and the Acquisition, partially offset by realized losses on NGL-based derivatives in 2024 compared to gains in 2023, and the nine-day unplanned outage at Aux Sable in July 2024. Crude oil sales volumes (4) Primarily higher due to increased blending opportunities driven by favorable price differentials in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. NGL sales volumes (4) Increase primarily due to higher ethane, propane, and butane sales largely due to the increase in Pembina's ownership interest in Aux Sable, and the impact of lower supply volumes from the Redwater Complex in 2023 due to the impacts of the Northern Pipeline system outage.

Projects & New Developments (1) The New Ventures group is responsible for the development of new large-scale, or value chain extending projects, including those that provide enhanced access to global markets and support a transition to a lower-carbon economy. Currently, Pembina is pursuing opportunities associated with LNG, low-carbon commodities, and large-scale GHG emissions reductions. Cedar LNG In June 2024, Pembina and its partner, the Haisla Nation, announced a positive FID in respect of the Cedar LNG Project, a 3.3 mtpa floating LNG facility in Kitimat, British Columbia, within the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation. The Cedar LNG Project will provide a valuable outlet for WCSB natural gas to access global markets and is expected to achieve higher prices for Canadian producers and enhance global energy security. Given that it will be a floating LNG facility, manufactured in the controlled conditions of a shipyard, it is expected that the Cedar LNG Project will have lower construction and execution risk. Further, powered by BC Hydro, the Cedar LNG Project is expected to be one of the lowest emissions LNG facilities in the world. Cedar LNG has secured a 20-year take-or-pay, fixed toll contract with ARC Resources Ltd. ("ARC") for 1.5 mtpa of LNG. As part of the arrangement with ARC, ARC will supply Cedar LNG with approximately 200 MMcf/d of natural gas to be transported via the Coastal GasLink Pipeline from its production base in the Montney. Pembina has also entered into an agreement with Cedar LNG for 1.5 mtpa of capacity on the same terms as ARC. In late 2024, Pembina initiated remarketing discussions with a broad range of potential customers, including both LNG portfolio players and Canadian producers. Pembina has received non- binding proposals covering well in excess of its contracted capacity and is in the process of shortlisting preferred counterparties to transition to definitive agreements. The Cedar LNG Project has an estimated cost of approximately U.S.$3.4 billion (gross), including U.S.$2.3 billion (gross), or approximately 70 percent of the estimated cost, for the floating LNG production unit, which is being constructed under a fixed-price, lump-sum agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries and Black & Veatch, and U.S.$1.1 billion (gross) related to onshore infrastructure, owner's costs, commissioning and start-up costs, financial assurances during construction, and other costs. The total cost of the Cedar LNG Project, including approximately U.S.$0.6 billion (gross) of interest during construction and transaction costs, is expected to be approximately U.S.$4.0 billion (gross). Site clearing and civil works on the marine terminal site commenced in the third quarter of 2024 and construction of the floating LNG facility is expected to begin in mid-2025. The anticipated in-service date of the Cedar LNG Project is in late 2028. Alberta Carbon Grid Pembina and TC Energy have formed a partnership to develop the Alberta Carbon Grid, a carbon transportation and sequestration platform. Alberta Carbon Grid completed the appraisal well drilling, logging and testing, with well data that was incorporated into a detailed subsurface model confirming the sequestration capability. Alberta Carbon Grid continues commercial conversations with potential customers and refining the project scope.

Relates primarily to fixed fee income related to shared service agreements with PGI. General and administrative Decrease largely due to lower incentives costs, primarily driven by the change in Pembina's share price in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Net finance costs Increase largely due to higher interest expense on long-term debt due to a combination of additional borrowing following the Acquisition, and higher interest rates. Earnings (loss) Consistent with prior period, as higher net finance costs were largely offset by lower incentives costs. Adjusted EBITDA (2) Increase largely due to lower incentives costs, discussed above. Income tax expense Increase largely due to the recognition of deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023, which lowered income tax expense in 2023, partially offset by lower earnings.

Relates primarily to fixed fee income related to shared service agreements with PGI. General and administrative Decrease largely due to lower consulting fees and lower incentives costs, partially offset by higher salaries and wages, and higher information technology-related maintenance costs. Other expense Increase largely due to higher acquisition fees and integration costs related to the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition. Loss on Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition $616 million loss recognized from the deemed disposition of Pembina's previous investments in the Acquirees following the Acquisition, offset by a $626 million deferred tax recovery recognized from the Acquisition, resulting in a net gain of $10 million. Refer to Note 4 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Net finance costs Increase largely due to higher interest expense on long-term debt due to a combination of additional borrowing following the Acquisition, and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest income. Earnings (loss) Decrease largely due to the loss recognized on the Acquisition, higher net finance costs, and higher acquisition fees and integration costs related to the Acquisition, partially offset by lower general & administrative costs. Adjusted EBITDA (2) Increase largely due to lower general & administrative costs, discussed above. Income tax (recovery) expense The income tax recovery in 2024 is largely due to a deferred tax recovery recognized in connection with the Acquisition, combined with an adjustment in the tax basis of an investment in partnership, and lower earnings, which resulted in a nine percent effective tax recovery rate in 2024 compared to an effective tax rate of 18.9 percent in 2023.

4. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Available Sources of Liquidity As at December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Working capital (1) (1,335) (588) Variable rate debt Senior unsecured credit facilities (2) 1,148 778 Interest rate swapped debt (360) (31) Total variable rate loans and borrowings outstanding (weighted average interest rate of 5.2% (2023: 6.3%)) 788 747 Fixed rate debt Senior unsecured medium-term notes 10,900 9,100 Interest rate swapped debt 360 31 Total fixed rate loans and borrowings outstanding (weighted average interest rate of 4.4% (2023: 4.0%)) 11,260 9,131 Total loans and borrowings outstanding 12,048 9,878 Cash and unutilized debt facilities 2,518 2,240 Subordinated hybrid notes (weighted average interest rate of 4.8% (2023: 4.8%)) 600 600 (1) Current assets of $1.6 billion (December 31, 2023: $2.6 billion) less current liabilities of $2.9 billion (December 31, 2023: $3.2 billion). As at December 31, 2024, working capital included $1.5 billion (December 31, 2023: $650 million) associated with the current portion of long-term debt. (2) Includes U.S. $250 million variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: U.S. $250 million), with the full notional amount hedged using an interest rate swap at 1.47 percent. Pembina currently anticipates that its cash flow from operating activities, the majority of which is derived from fee-based contracts, will be more than sufficient to meet its operating obligations, to fund its dividends and to fund its capital expenditures in the short term and long term. Pembina expects to source funds required for debt maturities from cash, its credit facilities and by accessing the capital markets, as required. Based on its successful access to financing in the capital markets over the past several years, Pembina expects to continue to have access to additional funds as required. Refer to "Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – Additional Financing and Capital Resources" in this MD&A and Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Management continues to monitor Pembina's liquidity and remains satisfied that the leverage employed in Pembina's capital structure is sufficient and appropriate given the characteristics and operations of the underlying asset base. Management may adjust Pembina's capital structure as a result of changes in economic conditions or the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or modify Pembina's capital structure in the future, Pembina may renegotiate debt terms, repay existing debt, seek new borrowings, issue additional equity or hybrid securities and/or repurchase or redeem additional common or preferred shares. As at December 31, 2024, Pembina's credit facilities consisted of: an unsecured $1.5 billion (December 31, 2023: $1.5 billion) revolving credit facility, which includes a $750 million (December 31, 2023: $750 million) accordion feature, which provides Pembina with the ability to increase the credit facility subject to lender approval, and matures in June 2029 (the "Revolving Facility"); an unsecured $1.0 billion (December 31, 2023: $1.0 billion) sustainability linked revolving credit facility, which matures in June 2027 (the "SLL Credit Facility"); an unsecured U.S. $250 million (December 31, 2023: U.S. $250 million) non- revolving term loan, which matures in May 2025; and an operating facility of $50 million (December 31, 2023: $50 million), which matures in June 2025 and is typically renewed on an annual basis (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). Following the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, Pembina assumed Alliance's unsecured credit facilities, including a $315 million term loan and a U.S. $250 million term loan, which mature in December 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2024, these term loans were reduced to $270 million and U.S. $240 million, respectively. Pembina also assumed two multi-use operating/revolving facilities of $30 million and U.S. $30 million, which were later cancelled in the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, Pembina assumed Aux Sable's unsecured credit facilities including a U.S. $20 million revolving credit facility and a U.S. $45 million revolving credit facility, both of which were cancelled in the fourth quarter of 2024. These cancellations were executed as a result of synergies identified following the Acquisition. 22 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 24
There are no mandatory principal repayments due over the term of the Credit Facilities. Pembina is required to meet certain specific and customary affirmative and negative financial covenants under the indenture governing its medium-term notes and the agreements governing its Credit Facilities, including a requirement to maintain certain financial ratios. See "Liquidity & Capital Resources – Covenants" below for more information. The SLL Credit Facility contains pricing adjustments that reduce or increase borrowing costs based on Pembina's performance relative to a GHG emissions intensity reduction performance target. Previously, Pembina announced its commitment to reduce its GHG emissions intensity by 30 percent by 2030, relative to baseline 2019 levels. The specific terms of the SLL Credit Facility include annual intermediate targets that align with Pembina's trajectory towards its 2030 target. Pembina is also subject to customary restrictions on its operations and activities under the indenture governing its medium- term notes and the agreements governing its Credit Facilities, including restrictions on the granting of security, incurring indebtedness and the sale of its assets. With the exception of the sustainability-linked adjustments to borrowing costs, the terms and conditions of the SLL Credit Facility and the Revolving Facility, including financial covenants, are substantially similar to each other. Financing Activity On January 12, 2024, Pembina closed an offering of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes. The January MTN Offering was conducted in three tranches, consisting of the issuance of $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 20 (the "Series 20 notes"), having a fixed coupon of 5.02 percent per annum, payable semi-annually and maturing on January 12, 2032; $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 21, having a fixed coupon of 5.21 percent per annum, payable semi-annually and maturing on January 12, 2034; and $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 22 (the "Series 22 notes"), having a fixed coupon of 5.67 percent per annum, payable semi-annually and maturing on January 12, 2054. Pembina used a portion of the net proceeds of the January MTN Offering to repay indebtedness of the Company under the Revolving Facility and for general corporate purposes. Pembina used the remaining net proceeds of the January MTN Offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition. Refer to the "Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition" section of this MD&A for additional information. On January 22, 2024, Pembina's $650 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 8, matured and were fully repaid. On April 18, 2024, Pembina completed an extension on its $1.5 billion Revolving Facility, which now matures on June 1, 2029, and an extension on its $50 million operating facility, which now matures on June 1, 2025. On June 28, 2024, Pembina closed an offering of $950 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes (the "June MTN Offering"). The June MTN Offering was conducted in three tranches, consisting of the issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 23 (the "Series 23 notes") having a fixed coupon of 5.22 percent per annum, payable semi-annually and maturing on June 28, 2033; $150 million aggregate principal amount issued through a re-opening of the Series 20 notes; and $150 million aggregate principal amount issued through a re- opening of the Series 22 notes. The net proceeds of the June MTN Offering were used to repay indebtedness of the Company under the Revolving Facility, to fund the partial redemption of the Series 19 notes (as defined below), and for general corporate purposes. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 23

On July 6, 2024, Pembina completed the redemption of $150 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 19 (the "Series 19 notes") due June 22, 2026 for cash. The Series 19 notes were redeemed at a redemption price of approximately $1,002 for each $1,000 principal amount of Series 19 notes, being equal to the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest up until, but excluding, July 6, 2024. Pembina funded the redemption of the Series 19 notes through a portion of the net proceeds of the June MTN Offering. On November 17, 2024, Pembina completed the redemption of its remaining outstanding $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Series 19 notes due June 22, 2026, for cash. The Series 19 notes were redeemed at a redemption price of approximately $1,023 for each $1,000 principal amount of Series 19 notes, being equal to the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest up until, but excluding, November 17, 2024. The redemption was funded through a combination of cash on hand and the use of Pembina's credit facility. Covenants Pembina is subject to certain financial covenants under the indentures governing its medium-term notes and the agreements governing the senior unsecured credit facilities. As at December 31, 2024, Pembina was in compliance with those covenants (December 31, 2023: in compliance). Debt Financial Covenant (1) Ratio Ratio as at December 31, 2024 Senior unsecured medium-term notes Funded Debt to Capitalization Maximum 0.70 (2) 0.40 Credit facilities Debt to Capital Maximum 0.70 (3) 0.40 (1) Terms as defined in relevant agreements. (2) Covenant must be met at the reporting date and filed within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year and within 10 business days after filing of the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Covenant must be met at the reporting date and filed within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year and 60 days after each quarter. Credit Risk Pembina continues to actively monitor and reassess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. The majority of Pembina's credit exposure is to investment grade counterparties. Pembina assesses all high exposure counterparties during the on- boarding process and actively monitors credit limits and exposure across the business. Pembina may reduce or mitigate its exposure to certain counterparties where it is deemed warranted and permitted under contractual terms. Where warranted, financial assurances may be sought from counterparties to mitigate and reduce risk, and such assurances may include guarantees, letters of credit and cash collateral. Letters of credit totaling $276 million (December 31, 2023: $124 million) were held as at December 31, 2024, primarily in respect of customer trade receivables. Credit Ratings The following information with respect to Pembina's credit ratings is provided as such information relates to Pembina's financing costs and liquidity. Specifically, credit ratings affect Pembina's ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing and the cost of such financing. A reduction in the current ratings of Pembina's debt by its rating agencies, particularly a downgrade below investment-grade ratings, could adversely affect Pembina's cost of financing and its access to sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, changes in credit ratings and the associated costs may affect Pembina's ability to enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions. Credit ratings are intended to provide investors with an independent measure of the credit quality of any issues of securities. The credit ratings assigned by the rating agencies are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the securities, nor do the credit rating agencies comment on the market price or suitability for a particular investor. Any credit rating may not remain in effect for a given period of time or may be revised or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. 24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Purchase prices of both NGL and power are dependent on current market prices. Volumes and prices for NGL and power contracts cannot be reasonably determined, and therefore, an amount has not been included in the contractual obligations schedule. Product purchase agreements range from one to seventeen years and involve the purchase of NGL products from producers. Assuming product is available, Pembina has secured between 16 and 148 mbpd of NGL each year up to and including 2041. Power purchase agreements range from one to 25 years and involve the purchase of power from electrical service providers. Pembina has secured up to 76 megawatts per day each year up to and including 2050. (2) Includes loans and borrowings, subordinated hybrid notes and interest payments on Pembina's senior unsecured medium-term notes. Excludes deferred financing costs. (3) Pembina signed two agreements relating to the Cedar LNG Project: (a) Liquefaction Tolling Services Agreement ("LTSA"); and, (b) Gas Supply Agreement ("GSA"). The LTSA is a 20-year take-or-pay fixed toll contract for 1.5 million tonnes per annum, while the GSA will allow for transport on the Coastal GasLink pipeline approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of Canadian natural gas to Cedar LNG. These commercial agreements account for approximately 50 percent of Cedar LNG's operating capacity and a total commitment of approximately $10.5 billion. These commitments are expected to commence upon the anticipated in-service date of the Cedar LNG Project in late 2028. (4) Includes pipelines, facilities, terminals, rail, office space, land and vehicle leases. (5) Excludes significant projects that are awaiting regulatory approval, projects which Pembina is not committed to construct, and projects that are executed by equity accounted investees. (6) Relates to expected variable lease payments excluded from the measurement of the lease liability, payments under lease contracts which have not yet commenced, and payments related to non-lease components in lessee lease contracts. Contingencies Pembina, including its subsidiaries and its investments in equity accounted investees, are subject to various legal and regulatory and tax proceedings, actions and audits arising in the normal course of business. Pembina represents its interests vigorously in all proceedings in which it is involved. Legal and administrative proceedings involving possible losses are inherently complex, and the Company applies significant judgment in estimating probable outcomes. As at December 31, 2024, there were no significant claims filed against Pembina for which management believes the resolution of any such actions or proceedings would have a material impact on Pembina's financial position or results of operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As at December 31, 2024, Pembina does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on Pembina's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.

Letters of Credit Pembina has provided letters of credit to various third parties in the normal course of conducting business. The letters of credit include financial guarantees to counterparties for product purchases and sales, transportation services, utilities, engineering and construction services. The letters of credit have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on Pembina's financial position, earnings, liquidity or capital resources. As at December 31, 2024, Pembina had $209 million (December 31, 2023: $201 million) in letters of credit issued. 26 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

In both 2024 and 2023, Pipelines capital expenditures continued to be largely related to Pembina's Peace Pipeline system expansion projects, including the Phase VIII Expansion which was placed into service in the second quarter of 2024, and the NEBC MPS Expansion. Facilities capital expenditures in 2024 and 2023 primarily related to Redwater expansion projects. In 2024 and 2023, there were no significant projects for Marketing & New Ventures capital expenditures. Corporate capital expenditures in 2024 and 2023 related mainly to information technology infrastructure and systems development. Future capital expenditures for 2025 are estimated to be between $745 million and $945 million and are primarily related to the construction of RFS IV, expansions to support volume growth in NEBC, investments required to meet Pembina's ethane supply commitments, investments in smaller growth projects, including various laterals and terminals, and spending on projects previously placed into service. Of the total future capital expenditure, approximately $200 million is designated for non-recoverable sustaining capital to support safe and reliable operations.

(2) Comparative 2023 period has been adjusted. See "Accounting Policies & Estimates – Change in Accounting Policies" and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the periods highlighted in the table above, there were new large-scale growth projects across Pembina's business being placed into service. The Company's financial and operating results have also been impacted by the volatility of commodity market prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and inflation. In addition to these factors, several other notable elements have impacted Pembina's financial and operating results during the specified periods above, including: • contributions made by Pembina of $241 million to Cedar LNG in 2024 to fund the Cedar LNG Project; • the completion of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition; • the closing of the Subscription Receipt Offering and the conversion of 29.9 million subscription receipts into common shares of the Company, concurrent with the closing of the Acquisition on April 1, 2024; • the impairment reversal of $231 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 in the Pipelines Division related to successful contract negotiations on the Nipisi Pipeline and the pipeline being put back into service in October 2023; • contributions made by Pembina of $145 million to Aux Sable in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing Pembina's proportionate share of a claim filed by a counterparty to an NGL supply agreement with Aux Sable which was settled and discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2023; and • the Northern Pipeline system outage in the first and second quarter of 2023 and the wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia in the second quarter of 2023, collectively resulted in a total impact on earnings of $95 million in 2023.

8. SELECTED EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTEE INFORMATION Loans and Borrowings of Equity Accounted Investees Under equity accounting, the assets and liabilities of an investee are reported as a single line item in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, "Investments in Equity Accounted Investees". To assist readers' understanding and to evaluate the capitalization of Pembina's investments, loans and borrowings associated with investments in equity accounted investees are presented below based on Pembina's proportionate ownership in such investees, as at December 31, 2024. The loans and borrowings are presented and classified by the division in which the results for the investee are reported. Please refer to the "Abbreviations" section for a summary of Pembina's investments in equity accounted investees and the division in which their results are reported. As at December 31 ($ millions) (1) 2024 2023 Pipelines (2) 19 344 Facilities 2,941 2,461 Marketing & New Ventures (3) 373 — Total 3,333 2,805 (1) Balances reflect Pembina's ownership percentage of the outstanding balance face value. (2) Pipelines included Alliance up to the closing of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition on April 1, 2024. Refer to the "About Pembina – Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition" and "Abbreviations" sections of this MD&A for more information. (3) Relates to the Cedar Term Loan (as defined below). Financing Activities for Equity Accounted Investees Cedar LNG On June 25, 2024, Pembina and its partner, the Haisla Nation, announced a positive FID in respect of the Cedar LNG Project. Prior to the positive FID, various letters of credit of $102 million and other parental guarantees were issued by Pembina on behalf of Cedar LNG, which had given rise to an insurance contract liability on Pembina's financial statements. Following the positive FID, the required financial assurances were assumed by Cedar LNG and as a result, Pembina recorded a gain of $34 million upon the derecognition of the related insurance contract liability in the second quarter of 2024. Cedar LNG secured a letter of credit facility whereby future financial assurances will be provided directly by Cedar LNG. In connection with the positive FID, Cedar LNG entered into project financing including a U.S. $2.7 billion senior secured construction/term loan facility ("Cedar Term Loan") and a $2.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility ("Cedar Revolving Facility"). The borrowings on the Cedar Term Loan will be used to finance approximately 60 percent of the Cedar LNG Project's costs. The Cedar Revolving Facility will be utilized to provide various letters of credit in support of the Project, including replacing the financial assurances previously issued by Pembina on behalf of Cedar LNG. Further, during the third quarter of 2024, Cedar LNG also entered into a series of economic interest rate hedges. These hedges, at a weighted average effective rate of 3.84 percent, fix a minimum of 75 percent of Cedar LNG's senior secured debt instruments. The floating debt is priced at USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). PGI In 2024, PGI leveraged its existing credit facilities to finance the previously announced acquisition of midstream assets from Whitecap Resources Inc. and Veren Inc. 32 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

10. ACCOUNTING POLICIES & ESTIMATES Changes in Accounting Policies The accounting policies used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note 3 of Pembina's Consolidated Financial Statements. Voluntary Change in Accounting Policies Physical derivative instruments include purchases and sales of commodities (crude, natural gas liquids, natural gas, and others), which are physically settled by receipt or delivery of the commodity. Unrealized gains and losses and the settlement of physical derivative instruments, including any realized gains and losses, have historically been recorded as revenue from contracts with customers and cost of sales for sales and purchases, respectively. Commodity-related financial derivative instruments include purchases and sales of commodities executed for risk management purposes that are net settled in cash, with no receipt or delivery of the underlying commodity. Unrealized gains and losses and the settlement of commodity-related financial 'sale' and 'purchase' derivative instruments, including any realized gains and losses, have historically been recorded net as 'Loss (gain) on commodity-related derivative financial instruments', which was previously presented separately from the Company's revenue-generating activities. Foreign exchange and interest rate risk management activities give rise to financial derivative contracts. Unrealized gains and losses for instruments that did not apply hedge accounting and the settlement of other financial derivative instruments, including any realized gains and losses, have historically been recorded as 'Net finance costs'. Consequently, all other non- commodity related financial derivative contracts have been recorded and presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. With respect to the related accounting policies above, Pembina has made the following voluntary changes retrospectively: (a) all unrealized and realized gains and losses and the settlement of physical derivative instruments and commodity-related financial derivative instruments recorded at fair value (purchases and sales) will be recorded on a net basis in revenue as 'Revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts'; and (b) all unrealized and realized gains and losses and the settlement of foreign exchange-related financial derivative instruments that are executed to economically hedge foreign exchange risk on commodity-related contracts will be recorded on a net basis in revenue as 'Revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts'. These voluntary changes in accounting policies were made for the following reasons in aid of providing more reliable and relevant information: (a) to better align the related financial reporting with the Company's business model; (b) to provide a more suitable illustration of the Company's use of derivative instruments for the purpose of asset optimization, risk management, and servicing customer needs; and (c) to improve consistency with peer and industry financial reporting and practices. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect adjustments made as a result of these voluntary changes in accounting policies. There is no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows for the current or any historic reporting period. The following table presents the impacts of the voluntary changes in accounting policies on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for each of the line items affected: Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 35

Reconciliation of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income 3 Months Ended December 31, 2023 12 Months Ended December 31, 2023 ($ millions) Previously reported Policy change Adjusted Previously reported Policy change Adjusted Revenue 2,466 (630) 1,836 9,125 (2,794) 6,331 Cost of sales 1,735 (655) 1,080 6,580 (2,773) 3,807 (Gain) loss on commodity-related derivative financial instruments (25) 25 — 21 (21) — Gross profit 850 — 850 2,840 — 2,840 Earnings before income tax 815 — 815 2,189 — 2,189 New Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Adopted IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements ("IFRS 18") IFRS 18 was issued in April 2024 and effective January 1, 2027, with early application permitted. The standard introduces key changes to the structure of the statement of earnings and comprehensive income, required disclosures for certain management-defined performance measures, and aggregation and disaggregation of line items in the financial statements. Pembina is currently reviewing the impact of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 - Contracts referencing Nature-dependent Electricity ("Contracts referencing NDE") Contracts referencing NDE was issued in December 2024 and effective January 1, 2026, with early adoption permitted. The amendments provide relief as it relates to accounting for contracts to purchase or sell electricity from nature-dependent sources such as wind and solar power, including clarifying the application of own-use requirements, permitting hedge accounting if these contracts are used as hedging instruments, and adding new disclosure to enable investors to understand the effect of these contracts to Pembina. Pembina is currently reviewing the impact of this amendment as it relates to Pembina's wind-based power purchase agreements. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that are based on facts and circumstances as at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Judgments, estimates, and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Information about estimates and judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is included in the following notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Judgments • Note 2(b)(ii): Assessment of joint control for joint arrangements; • Note 3(f)(ii): The determination of cash generating units ("CGUs") in the assessment of non-financial asset impairments; and • Note 3(j): Identification of performance obligations in revenue arrangements. Estimates • Note 5: Fair value of previously held interest in the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition; • Note 3(f)(ii): Recoverability of non-financial assets; and • Note 24: Fair value of Level 3 derivative instruments. 36 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

11. RISK FACTORS Pembina's value proposition is based on balancing economic benefit against risk. Where appropriate, Pembina will seek to reduce risk. Pembina continually works to mitigate the impact of potential risks to its business by identifying all significant risks so that they can be appropriately managed. To assist with identifying and managing risk, Pembina has implemented a comprehensive risk management program. The risks that may affect the business and operations of Pembina and its operating subsidiaries are described below. Further, additional discussion about counterparty risk, market risk, liquidity risk and additional information on financial risk management can be found in Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks Inherent in Pembina's Business Commodity Price and Volume Risk Pembina's business is exposed to commodity price volatility and a substantial decline in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect its financial results. Certain of the transportation contracts or tolling arrangements with respect to Pembina's pipeline assets do not include take- or-pay commitments from crude oil and natural gas producers and, as a result, Pembina is exposed to volume risk with respect to those assets. A decrease in volumes transported can directly and adversely affect Pembina's revenues and earnings. The demand for, and utilization of, Pembina's pipeline assets may be impacted by factors such as changing market fundamentals, capacity bottlenecks, operational incidents, regulatory restrictions, system maintenance, weather and increased competition. Market fundamentals, such as commodity prices and price differentials, natural gas and gasoline consumption, alternative energy sources and global supply disruptions outside of Pembina's control can impact both the supply of and demand for the commodities transported on Pembina's pipelines, which can, in turn, impact the demand for, and utilization of, Pembina's pipeline assets. See " Reserve Replacement, Throughput and Product Demand " below . Pembina's Marketing business includes activities related to product storage, terminalling, and hub services. These activities expose Pembina to certain risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and, as a result, Pembina may experience volatility in revenue and impairments related to the book value of stored product with respect to these activities. Primarily, Pembina enters into contracts to purchase and sell crude oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas at floating market prices and, as a result, the prices of products that are marketed by Pembina are subject to volatility as a result of factors such as seasonal demand changes, the actions of OPEC, extreme weather conditions (the severity of which could increase due to climate change), geopolitical events such as armed conflict and political instability, and developments relating thereto, market inventory levels, general economic conditions, the availability and price of transportation logistics, changes in commodity markets, the availability and pricing of alternate fuel sources and other factors. Pembina manages its risk exposure by balancing purchases and sales to secure less volatile margins; however, Pembina may be unsuccessful in securing such margins and may, at times, have unbalanced purchases and sales. Further, in certain situations, a producer or supplier could fail to deliver contracted volumes or could deliver in excess of contracted volumes, or a purchaser could purchase less than contracted volumes. Any of these circumstances could cause Pembina's purchases and sales to be unbalanced, which may increase Pembina's exposure to commodity price risks and could increase volatility in its revenue and cash flows. Notwithstanding Pembina's management of price and quality risk, marketing margins for commodities can vary and have varied significantly from period to period in the past. This variability could have an adverse effect on the results of Pembina's Marketing business and its overall results of operations. To assist in reducing this inherent variability in its Marketing business, Pembina has invested, and will continue to invest, in assets that have a fee-based revenue component. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 37

Page 39
Pembina is also exposed to potential price declines and decreasing frac spreads between the time Pembina purchases NGL feedstock and sells NGL products. Frac spread is the difference between the revenue from the sale of NGL if removed from a gas stream and the value such NGL would have had if left in the gas stream and sold at natural gas prices. Frac spreads can change significantly from period to period depending on the relationship between NGL and natural gas prices (the "frac spread ratio"), absolute commodity prices, transport differentials and changes in the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In addition to the frac spread ratio changes, there is also a differential between NGL product prices and crude oil prices which can change margins realized for midstream products. The amount of profit or loss made on the extraction portion of the business will generally increase or decrease with frac spreads. This exposure could result in variability of cash flow generated by the Marketing business. Regulation and Legislation In addition to environmental and social considerations, regulatory authorities consider economic aspects of pipelines. There is legislation aimed at ensuring that producers have fair and reasonable opportunities to produce, process and market their reserves. For example, in certain instances, regulatory authorities may declare the operator of a pipeline to be a common carrier of crude oil, NGL or natural gas. In doing so, regulators establish conditions under which a pipeline must accept and carry product, including the tariffs that may be charged, and requires that operators cannot unduly discriminate between their customers. Additionally, producers and shippers may apply to the appropriate regulatory authorities for a review of tariffs in certain instances, and such tariffs may then be regulated if it is found that the tariffs are not just and reasonable. The potential for enhanced regulatory oversight of tariffs for pipelines, including the Alliance Pipeline (the tolls and tariffs of which are subject to enhanced Canadian Energy Regulator ("CER") oversight as a Group 1 company) and certain pipelines owned by Pembina's subsidiaries in British Columbia (the tolls and tariffs of which are subject to BCUC oversight), could result in tariff levels that are less favourable to Pembina and could impact the economic operation of such pipeline systems. The AER is the primary regulatory body that oversees Pembina's Alberta-issued development permits, with some minor exceptions. Certain of Pembina's subsidiaries own pipelines in British Columbia, which are regulated by the BCER and the BCUC, and pipelines that cross provincial or international boundaries, which are regulated by the CER and/or the FERC and PHMSA. Certain of Pembina's operations and expansion projects are subject to additional regulations and, as Pembina's operations expand throughout Canada and North America, Pembina may be required to comply with the requirements of additional regulators and legislative bodies, including the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (the "IAAC"), the BCEAO, the Ontario Energy Board, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, the Saskatchewan Ministry of Energy and Resources and Regulatory Services (Oil and Gas) under Manitoba Economic Development, Investment, Trade and Natural Resources. In the U.S., FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipelines and the transportation of crude oil, NGL and refined products in interstate commerce. Under the NGA, FERC regulates the construction, extension, and abandonment of interstate natural gas pipelines and the rates, terms and conditions of service and other aspects of the business of interstate natural gas pipelines. Interstate natural gas pipelines rates, terms and conditions of service are filed at FERC and publicly available. Under the ICA, FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions of the transportation in interstate commerce of crude oil, NGL and refined products. Pipeline safety is regulated by the PHMSA, which sets standards for the design, construction, pressure testing, operation and maintenance, corrosion control, training and qualification of personnel, accident reporting and record keeping. The Office of Pipeline Safety, within the PHMSA, inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations across the U.S. All regulations and environmental, safety and economic compliance obligations are subject to change at the initiative of FERC, PHMSA or other United States Federal agencies with jurisdiction over aspects of the operations of pipelines, including environmental, economic and safety regulations. Changes by FERC in its regulations or policies could adversely impact Pembina's natural gas pipelines, making the construction, extension, expansion or abandonment of such pipelines more costly, causing delays in the permitting of such projects or impacting the likelihood of success of completion of such projects. 38 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 40
Similarly, changes in FERC's regulations or policies could adversely impact the rates that Pembina's FERC-regulated pipelines are able to charge and how such pipelines do business, whether such pipelines are regulated by FERC pursuant to the NGA or the ICA. Pembina continually monitors existing, new and changing regulations in all jurisdictions in which it currently operates, or into which it may expand in the future, and the potential implications to its operations; however, Pembina cannot predict future regulatory changes, and any such compliance and regulatory changes in any one or multiple jurisdictions could have a material adverse impact on Pembina and its financial results. Pursuant to the Impact Assessment Act (Canada) (the "IAA"), the IAAC is the authority responsible for conducting all federal impact assessments for certain designated projects under the IAA. Pursuant to the five-year review process mandated by the IAA, the federal government is currently reviewing the list of designated projects which are subject to mandatory assessment under the IAA, such as international and interprovincial pipelines of at least 75 kilometers in length. Based on the IAAC's 2024 discussion paper regarding its review of designated projects, it does not appear that the IAAC is considering any changes to the inclusion or types of pipelines that are currently listed as designated projects. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada (the "Minister") may also designate a project as reviewable under the IAA. However, pursuant to recent amendments to the IAA as further discussed below, a potential for non-negligible adverse effects within federal jurisdiction must exist for the Minister to designate a project as reviewable. The CER continues to oversee approved federal, interprovincial and international energy projects, with new projects being referred to a review panel under the IAA. On July 16, 2020, the federal government published the Strategic Assessment of Climate Change ("SACC") under the provisions for such assessments in the IAA. The SACC imposes the new requirements regarding GHG emissions planning on projects subject to the IAA and has also been incorporated in legacy assessments begun under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 but concluded by the IAAC. Indications are that the SACC and new guidance on a "best in class" approach to GHG emissions requirements, which guidance is yet to be released, will strictly limit GHG emissions from IAA-regulated projects, in support of the federal government's net-zero by 2050 goal discussed under " Environmental Costs and Liabilities " below. On October 13, 2023, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the IAA was, in significant part, unconstitutional. In response to this decision, the federal government amended the IAA pursuant to the Budget Implementation Act (2024, No. 1) , which received royal assent on June 20, 2024. The amendments narrow the scope of project effects that may trigger an assessment pursuant to the IAA. The amendments also permit the substitution of a federal impact assessment with equivalent assessment processes from another jurisdiction and clarify the public interest test to be applied when determining whether to allow a designated project to proceed. Relatively few projects have been subject to the federal impact assessment regime to date and Pembina continues to actively monitor developments in this area. To the extent these changes lengthen the review timeline for projects or expand the scope of the matters to be considered, the regime could materially impact the amount of time and capital resources required by Pembina to seek and obtain approval to construct and operate certain international or interprovincial pipelines or other projects designated pursuant to the IAA project list or ministerial designation powers under the IAA. The ongoing development of the CER Act and IAA regime could therefore materially and directly impact Pembina's business and financial results, and could indirectly affect Pembina's business and financial results by impacting the financial condition and growth projects of its customers and, ultimately, production levels and throughput on Pembina's pipelines and in its facilities.In addition to the direct regulation of pipelines and midstream facilities, Pembina's business and operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by changes in, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as described under " Environmental Costs and Liabilities " below. Pembina's business and financial condition may also be influenced by regulatory changes applicable to land sales, exploration, development and retail and consumer uses, and federal and foreign legislation affecting, in particular, foreign investment, through legislation such as the Competition Act (Canada), the Investment Canada Act (Canada) and equivalent legislation in foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that changes to regulatory and environmental laws or policies and government incentive programs relating to the pipeline or crude oil and natural gas industry, or unfavourable decisions of regulatory bodies or outcomes of regulatory hearings, will not adversely affect Pembina or the value of its securities.

Operational Risks Operational risks include, but are not limited to: pipeline leaks; the breakdown or failure of equipment, pipelines and facilities, information systems or processes; the compromise of information and control systems; the performance of equipment at levels below those originally intended (whether due to misuse, unexpected degradation or design, construction or manufacturing defects); releases at truck terminals, storage terminals and hubs; releases associated with the loading and unloading of potentially harmful substances onto rail cars and trucks; adverse sea conditions (including storms and rising sea levels) and releases or spills from shipping vessels loaded at Pembina's Vancouver Wharves or the Prince Rupert Terminal; failure to maintain adequate supplies of spare parts; operator error; labour disputes; disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers; operational disruptions or apportionment on third-party systems or refineries, which may prevent the full utilization of Pembina's facilities and pipelines; and catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, those related to climate change and extreme weather events, including fires, floods and other natural disasters, explosions, train derailments, earthquakes, widespread epidemics or pandemic outbreaks, acts of civil protest or disobedience, terrorism or sabotage, and other similar events, many of which are beyond the control of Pembina and all of which could result in operational disruptions, damage to assets, related releases or other environmental issues, and delays in construction, labour and materials. Pembina may also be exposed from time to time to additional operational risks not stated in the immediately preceding sentence. In addition, the consequences of any operational incident (including as a result of adverse sea conditions) at Vancouver Wharves and the Prince Rupert Terminal or involving a vessel receiving products from Vancouver Wharves or the Prince Rupert Terminal may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing leaks and releases occurring in the ocean or along coastlines and/or the repair of marine terminals. Any leaks, releases or other incidents involving such vessels, or other similar operations along the West Coast, could result in significant harm to the environment, curtailment of, or disruptions of and/or delays in, offshore shipping activity in the affected areas, including Pembina's ability to effectively carry on operations at Vancouver Wharves and the Prince Rupert Terminal. The occurrence or continuance of any of the foregoing events could increase the cost of operating Pembina's assets and/or reduce revenue, or result in damages, claims or fines, environmental damages, personal injury or loss of life, all of which could adversely affect Pembina's operations, financial performance and/or reputation. Additionally, facilities and pipelines are reliant on electrical power for their operations. A failure or disruption within the local or regional electrical power supply or distribution or transmission systems could significantly affect ongoing operations. Further, a significant increase in the cost of power or fuel, whether through increased demand or otherwise, could have a materially negative effect on the level of profit realized in cases where the relevant contracts do not provide for recovery of such costs. Pembina is committed to preserving customer and shareholder value by proactively managing operational risk through safe and reliable operations. Operational leaders are responsible for the supervision of operational risk by ensuring appropriate policies, procedures and systems are in place within their business units and internal controls are operating efficiently. Pembina also has an extensive program to manage pipeline system integrity, which includes the development and use of in- line inspection tools and various other leak detection technologies. Pembina's maintenance, inspection, excavation and repair programs are focused on risk mitigation and, as such, integrity maintenance programs are developed and resources are directed to areas based on continual risk assessments and infrastructure is replaced or repaired as required to ensure that Pembina's assets are operated safely and reliably. Pembina carries insurance coverage with respect to some, but not all, casualty occurrences in amounts customary for similar business operations, which coverage may not be sufficient to compensate for all casualty occurrences. In addition, Pembina has a comprehensive Security Management Program designed to reduce security-related risks. 40 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Competition Pembina competes with other pipeline, midstream, marketing and gas processing, fractionation and handling/storage service providers in its service areas as well as other transporters of crude oil, NGL and natural gas. The introduction of competing transportation alternatives into Pembina's service areas could result in the reduction of throughput in Pembina's pipelines which could result in decreased revenues and profits for Pembina. Additionally, potential pricing differentials on the components of NGL may result in these components being transported by competing gas pipelines. Pembina is determined to meet, and believes that it is prepared for, these existing and potential competitive pressures, including through agreements which provide for areas of dedication over the geographic areas in which Pembina's pipeline infrastructure is located. In addition, competition from non-hydrocarbon based energy sources may have an adverse effect on the production of crude oil, NGL and natural gas and, as a result, on the demand for Pembina's services. Pembina also competes with other businesses for growth and business opportunities, including competition related to potential greenfield development opportunities, which could impact its ability to grow through acquisitions and developments and could impact earnings and cash flow available to pay dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations. See " Description of Pembina's Business and Operations " in the AIF for the year ended December 31, 2024 for further information. Reliance on Principal Customers Pembina sells services and products to large customers within its area of operations and relies on several significant customers to purchase product for the Marketing business. Although none of these customers alone account for more than 10 percent of Pembina's revenue as of December 31, 2024, if for any reason any of these parties are unable to perform their obligations under the various agreements with Pembina, the revenue and operations of Pembina could be negatively impacted, which could also adversely affect the cash flow available for dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations. See " General Risk Factors – Counterparty Credit Risk " below. Completion and Timing of Expansion Projects The successful completion of Pembina's growth and expansion projects is dependent on a number of factors outside of Pembina's control, including the impact of general economic, business and market conditions, availability of capital on terms and rates acceptable to Pembina, receipt of regulatory approvals, reaching long-term commercial arrangements with customers in respect of certain portions of the expansions, construction schedules, commissioning difficulties or delays and costs that may change depending on supply, demand and/or inflation, labour, materials and equipment availability, contractor non-performance, acts of civil protest or disobedience, terrorism or sabotage, weather conditions, cost of engineering services, change in governments that granted the requisite regulatory approvals, and completion of third-party infrastructure projects that Pembina's projects rely upon. There is no certainty, nor can Pembina provide any assurance, that necessary regulatory approvals will be received on terms that maintain the expected return on investment associated with a specific project, or at all, or that satisfactory commercial arrangements with suppliers or customers will be entered into on a timely basis, or at all, or that third parties will comply with contractual obligations in a timely manner. Factors such as special interest group opposition, Indigenous, landowner and other stakeholder consultation requirements, civil protest or disobedience, changes in shipper support, and changes to the legislative or regulatory framework could all have an impact on meeting contractual and regulatory milestones. As a result, the cost estimates and completion dates for Pembina's major projects may change during different stages of the project. Greenfield and early stage projects face additional challenges, including securing leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and/or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities allowing access for such purposes, as well as Indigenous consultation requirements. Accordingly, actual costs and construction schedules may vary from initial estimates and these differences can be significant, and certain projects may not proceed as planned, or at all. Further, there is a risk that maintenance will be required more often than currently planned or that significant maintenance capital projects could arise that were not previously anticipated. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 41

Page 43
Under most of Pembina's construction and operating agreements, the Company is obligated to construct the facilities and pipelines regardless of delays and cost increases and Pembina bears the risk for any cost overruns. Future agreements entered into with customers with respect to expansions may contain similar conditions. While Pembina is not currently aware of any significant undisclosed cost overruns with respect to its current projects at the date hereof, any such cost overruns may adversely affect the economics of particular projects, as well as Pembina's business operations and financial results, and could reduce Pembina's expected return on investment which could, in turn, reduce the level of cash available for dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations. See " General Risk Factors – Additional Financing and Capital Resources " and " Customer Contracts " below. Urban Encroachment Near Leases and Rights of Way Pembina operates certain of its assets in or near urban areas. Land use decisions made by municipal governments or other authorities may increase or introduce exposure to the public within defined emergency planning zones. Unmitigated, such exposure has the potential to increase the severity and likelihood of public safety impacts should a failure event occur. Urban encroachment may result in incremental capital expenditures to increase pipeline wall thickness and re-route pipelines so that emergency planning zones can be reduced in size or avoid areas of development. Operational pressures may also be required to be lowered, which reduces throughput on pipelines. These issues could impact the competitiveness of certain assets and Pembina's ability to meet customer demand. Reliance on Other Facilities and Third-Party Services Certain of the Company's terminals, pipelines and rail activities are dependent upon their interconnections with other terminals, pipelines and rail networks and facilities owned and operated by third parties to reach end markets and as a significant source of supply for the Company's facilities. These connections are important to Pembina and its customers as they provide critical transportation routes, both from the perspective of delivering product to Pembina's facilities and providing product egress. Risks may be created as a result of: differences in pressures; specifications or capacities which affect operations; planned and unplanned outages or curtailments at third-party facilities that restrict deliveries to or from Pembina's facilities; and measurement and component balancing errors affecting product deliveries. As well, there may be issues with respect to scheduling and service delivery by third parties that affect Pembina's operations, such as the scheduling and availability of timely and reliable rail service by the railway companies on which Pembina relies to move product. Operational disruptions, apportionment, regulatory action and other events on third-party systems and infrastructure may prevent the full utilization of Pembina's facilities, require Pembina to spend additional capital, or otherwise negatively affect Pembina's operations. Pembina is unable to control operations, events, decisions, regulatory actions or public perceptions with respect to third-party assets and facilities, making the mitigation of these risks challenging. Although Pembina employs strategies to assist in mitigating these risks, including having multiple connections, service arrangements or transportation alternatives available in order to provide flexibility during curtailments or interruptions, there is no assurance such strategies will be effective. Where such alternatives are not available or are not effective, Pembina's operations may be significantly affected. Possible Failure to Realize Anticipated Benefits of Corporate Strategy Pembina evaluates the value proposition for new investments, acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis. Planning and investment analysis is highly dependent on accurate forecasting assumptions and, to the extent that these assumptions do not materialize, financial performance may be lower or more volatile than expected. Volatility in the economy, changes in cost estimates, failure to obtain regulatory approvals and permits, project scoping and risk assessment could result in decreased returns and loss of profits for Pembina. 42 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 44
As part of its ongoing strategy, Pembina may complete acquisitions of assets or other entities in the future. Achieving the benefits of completed and future acquisitions depends, in part, on successfully consolidating functions and integrating operations, procedures and personnel in a timely and efficient manner, as well as Pembina's ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and synergies from combining the acquired businesses and operations with those of Pembina. In particular, large scale acquisitions may involve significant pricing and integration risk. The integration of acquired businesses and entities requires the dedication of substantial management effort, time and resources, which may divert management's focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process. The integration process may also result in the loss of key employees and the disruption of ongoing business, customer and employee relationships, which may adversely affect Pembina's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions. Acquisitions may also expose Pembina to additional risks, including risks relating to entry into markets or businesses in which Pembina has little or no direct prior experience, increased credit risks through the assumption of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities and exposure to liabilities of the acquired business or assets. As part of its value proposition evaluation, Pembina may also desire to divest assets to optimize its operations and financial performance. Pembina may, however, be unable to sell certain assets or, if Pembina is able to sell certain assets, it may not receive the optimal or desired amount of proceeds from such asset sales. Additionally, the timing to close any asset sales could be significantly different than Pembina's expected timeline. See " General Risk Factors – Additional Financing and Capital Resources " below. Joint Ownership and Third-Party Operators Certain of Pembina's assets are jointly owned and are governed by partnership or shareholder agreements entered into with third-parties. As a result, certain decisions relating to these assets require the approval of a simple majority of the owners, while others require supermajority or unanimous approval of the owners. In addition, certain of these assets are operated by unrelated third-party entities. The success of these assets is, to some extent, dependent on the effectiveness of the business relationship and decision-making among Pembina and the other joint owner(s) and the expertise and ability of any third-party operators to operate and maintain the assets. While Pembina believes that there are prudent governance and other contractual rights in place, there can be no assurance that Pembina will not encounter disputes with joint owners or that assets operated by third parties will perform as expected. Further, if a joint owner were to become insolvent, regulators may require Pembina to assume such joint owner's obligations and Pembina may face operational challenges during any insolvency proceedings, resulting in additional costs. Such events could impact operations or cash flows of these assets or cause them to not operate as Pembina expects which could, in turn, have a negative impact on Pembina's business operations and financial results, and could reduce Pembina's expected return on investment, thereby reducing the level of cash available for dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations. Agreements for joint ownership often contain restrictions on transferring an interest in an asset or an entity, including consent requirements and rights of first refusal. Such provisions may restrict Pembina's ability to transfer its interests in such assets or entities or to acquire a joint venture owner's interest in such assets or entities, and may also restrict Pembina's ability to maximize the value of a sale of its interest. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 43

Page 45
Reserve Replacement, Throughput and Product Demand Pembina's pipeline revenue is based on a variety of tolling arrangements, including fee-for-service, cost-of-service agreements and market - based tolls. As a result, certain pipeline revenue is heavily dependent upon throughput levels of crude oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas. Future throughput on crude oil, NGL and natural gas pipelines and replacement of crude oil and natural gas reserves in Pembina's service areas will be dependent upon the activities of producers operating in those areas as they relate to exploiting their existing reserve bases and exploring for and developing additional reserves, and technological improvements leading to increased recovery rates. Similarly, the volumes of natural gas processed through Pembina's gas processing assets depends on the production of natural gas in the areas serviced by the gas processing business and associated pipelines. Without reserve additions, or expansion of the service areas, volumes on such pipelines and in such facilities would decline over time as reserves are depleted. As crude oil and natural gas reserves are depleted, production costs may increase relative to the value of the remaining reserves in place, causing producers to shut-in production or seek out lower cost alternatives for transportation. If, as a result, the level of tolls collected by Pembina decreases, cash flow available for dividends to Shareholders and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and Pembina's other debt obligations could be adversely affected. Over the long-term, the ability and willingness of shippers to continue production will also depend, in part, on the level of demand and prices for crude oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas in the markets served by the crude oil, NGL and natural gas pipelines and gas processing and gathering infrastructure in which Pembina has an interest. Producers may shut-in production at lower product prices or higher production costs. Global economic events may continue to have a substantial impact on the prices of crude oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas. Pembina cannot predict the impact of future supply/demand or economic conditions, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel efficiency and energy generation in the energy and petrochemical industries or future demand for and prices of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGL. A lower commodity price environment will generally reduce drilling activity and, as a result, the demand for Pembina's assets and services could decline. Producers in the areas serviced by Pembina may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves or achieving technological improvements to increase recovery rates and lower production costs during periods of lower commodity prices, which may also reduce demand for Pembina's assets and services. Future prices of these hydrocarbons are determined by supply and demand factors, including weather and general economic conditions as well as economic, political and other conditions in other crude oil and natural gas producing regions, all of which are beyond Pembina's control. The rate and timing of production from proven natural gas reserves tied into gas plants is at the discretion of producers and is subject to regulatory constraints. Producers have no obligation to produce from their natural gas reserves, which means production volumes are at the discretion of producers. Lower production volumes may increase the competition for natural gas supply at gas processing plants, which could result in higher shrinkage premiums being paid to natural gas producers. In addition, lower production volumes may lead to less demand for pipelines and processing capacity and could adversely impact Pembina's ability to re-contract on favourable terms with shippers as current agreements expire. 44 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 46
Customer Contracts Throughput on Pembina's pipelines is governed by transportation contracts or tolling arrangements with various crude oil and natural gas producers. Pembina is party to numerous contracts of varying durations in respect of its gas gathering, processing and fractionation facilities as well as its terminalling and storage services. Any default by counterparties under such contracts or any expiration or early termination of such contracts or tolling arrangements without renewal or replacement, provided that such contracts are material to Pembina's business and operations, may have an adverse effect on Pembina's business and results from operations and there is no guarantee that any of the contracts that Pembina currently has in place will be renewed at the end of their term, including on terms favourable to Pembina, or replaced with other contracts in the event of early termination. Further, certain contracts associated with the services described above are comprised of a mixture of firm and non-firm commitments. The revenue that Pembina earns on non-firm or firm commitments without take-or-pay service is dependent on the volume of crude oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas produced by producers in the relevant geographic areas. Accordingly, lower production volumes in these areas, including for reasons such as low commodity prices, may have an adverse effect on Pembina's revenue, which could also adversely affect the cash flow available for dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations. See " Description of Pembina's Business and Operations " in the AIF for the year ended December 31, 2024 for further information. Inflation The general rate of inflation impacts the economies and business environments in which Pembina operates. In response to easing global inflationary pressures, major central banks, including the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve, decreased benchmark interest rates multiple times throughout 2024 and, although inflation trended downward in 2024, inflationary pressures may increase in the future, resulting in central banks raising interest rates in the future. While many of Pembina's pipeline transportation agreements and facilities agreements contain provisions protecting against inflation by adjusting pricing based on changes in the consumer price index or other similar figures, increased inflation and any economic conditions resulting from governmental attempts to reduce future increases in inflation, including the imposition of higher interest rates or wage and price controls, may negatively impact levels of demand for Pembina's services and cost of inputs, and could, accordingly, have a negative impact on Pembina's business, financial condition and results of operations. Higher interest rates as a result of inflation could negatively impact the Company's borrowing costs, which could, in turn, have a negative impact on Pembina's cash flow and ability to service obligations under its debt securities and other debt obligations, and impact Pembina's ability to sanction new projects. Risks Relating to Natural Gas and NGL Composition Each of Pembina's gas processing facilities is designed to process natural gas and NGL feedstock within a certain range of composition specifications. The facilities may require modification to operate efficiently if the composition of the natural gas or NGL being processed changes significantly. The configuration of each of Pembina's gas processing facilities may not be optimal for efficient operation in the future if a change in inlet natural gas or NGL composition is outside a plant’s acceptable range of composition specifications. Pembina monitors plant throughput, natural gas and NGL composition, third-party system performance and industry development activity in the production areas surrounding its facilities on an ongoing basis. This information is used to assist with ongoing operational decisions, bringing on new production and new customers, evaluating expansion opportunities and assessing opportunities to modify or add new services to accept the inlet gas and NGL in the areas surrounding its facilities. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 45

Page 47
Risks Relating to Leases and Rights of Way Access Certain Pembina facilities and associated infrastructure are located on lands leased or licensed from third parties and such leases and licenses must be renewed from time to time. Failure to renew the leases or licenses on terms acceptable to Pembina could significantly reduce the operations of such facilities and could result in related decommissioning costs for Pembina, pursuant to the terms of such leases or licenses. Successful development of new pipelines or extensions to existing pipelines depends in part on securing leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and/or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities allowing access for such purposes. The process of securing rights-of-way or similar access is becoming more complex, particularly in more densely populated, environmentally sensitive and other areas. The inability to secure such rights-of-way or similar access could have an adverse effect on Pembina's operations and financial results. Reputation Reputational risk is the potential risk that market- or company-specific events, or other factors, could result in the deterioration of Pembina's reputation with key stakeholders. Pembina's business and operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with key stakeholders, including local communities, Indigenous communities and other groups directly impacted by the Company's activities, as well as governments and government agencies. The potential for deterioration of Pembina's reputation exists in many business decisions, which may negatively impact Pembina's business and the value of its securities. Reputational risk cannot be managed in isolation from other forms of risk. Credit, market, operational, insurance, liquidity, environmental, regulatory and legal, and technology risks, among others, must all be managed effectively to safeguard Pembina's reputation. Pembina's reputation could also be impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry, particularly other energy infrastructure providers, over which Pembina has no control. In particular, Pembina's reputation could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents, expansion plans or new projects or due to opposition from civilians or organizations opposed to energy, oil sands and pipeline development and, particularly, with transportation of production from oil sands producing regions. Further, Pembina's reputation could be negatively impacted by changing public attitudes towards climate change and the perceived causes thereof, over which the Company has no control. Negative impacts resulting from a compromised reputation, whether caused by Pembina's actions or otherwise, could include revenue loss, reduction in customer base, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals with respect to growth projects, reduced access to capital or decreased value of Pembina's securities and reduced insurance capacity and coverage. Environmental Costs and Liabilities Pembina's operations, facilities and petroleum product shipments are subject to extensive national, regional and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air, land and water, the handling and storage of petroleum products and hazardous materials, waste disposal, the protection of employee health, safety and the environment, and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Pembina's facilities may experience incidents, malfunctions or other unplanned events that may result in spills or emissions and/or result in personal injury, fines, penalties, other sanctions or property damage. Pembina may also incur liability for environmental contamination associated with past and present activities and properties. 46 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 48
Pembina's pipelines and facilities must maintain a number of environmental and other permits from various governmental authorities in order to operate, and Pembina's facilities are subject to inspection and audit from time to time. Failure to maintain compliance with regulatory and permit requirements could result in operational interruptions, fines or penalties, or the need to install additional pollution control technology. Licenses and permits must be renewed from time to time and there is no guarantee that a license or permit will be renewed on the same or similar conditions as it was initially granted. There can be no assurance that Pembina will be able to obtain all licenses, permits, registrations, approvals and authorizations that may be required to conduct operations that it may wish to undertake. Further, if at any time regulatory authorities deem any of Pembina's pipelines or facilities unsafe or not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, they may order such facilities to be shut down. Certain significant environmental legislative initiatives that may materially impact Pembina's business and financial results and condition are outlined below. On June 29, 2021, the federal government enacted the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which legislated a federal commitment to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and a nearer-term target of the federal government's Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Climate Agreement, which currently is a 40 to 50 percent GHG emissions reduction by 2030. The upstream crude oil and natural gas industry is expected to contribute a significant amount of the reduction needed to achieve these goals. On December 7, 2023, the federal government released its "2023 Progress Report on the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan" and highlighted the importance of new regulatory changes, such as the implementation of an oil and gas emissions cap and methane reduction requirements, to Canada's success in reaching long- term climate targets. The federal government's net-zero strategy includes a number of specific measures described below, but is also expected to affect the decision-making of all federal government bodies, including federal regulators, consistent with, for instance, the application of the SACC to projects subject to the IAA, as described above. However, given the Supreme Court of Canada's holding that the IAA was substantially unconstitutional in 2023, the implementation of many of these measures is expected to be subject to challenge. The federal government has mandated a pan-Canadian carbon price pursuant to the GGPPA. The carbon price is $80 per tonne in 2024, rising by $15 per tonne per year until 2030 to a price of $170 per tonne. The GGPPA establishes a set of minimum national standards for carbon pricing in Canada, which standards apply to provinces that otherwise fail to impose adequate provincial carbon pricing measures. A revised minimum national benchmark released in August 2021 under the GGPPA increased the stringency of the pan-Canadian carbon price and the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan stated that the federal government will explore ways to maintain the carbon price against future legislative changes. The increasing carbon price and any potential future amendments to the GGPPA may impose additional costs on the operations of Pembina and Pembina's customers. The federal Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) ("Federal Methane Regulations"), which require reduction of fugitive and vented gas emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector, came into force on January 1, 2020. Draft amendments to the Federal Methane Regulations were released on December 16, 2023 ("Amended Federal Methane Regulations"). The Amended Federal Methane Regulations include enhanced reduction targets, an annual third-party inspection requirement and a performance-based option as an alternative pathway to compliance. The Amended Federal Methane Regulations are planned to take effect in 2027 and apply across the sector by 2030, and may impose additional costs on the operations of Pembina and Pembina's customers. By an equivalency agreement with the federal government, which came into force October 26, 2020, the Federal Methane Regulations do not currently apply in Alberta. The application of the Federal Methane Regulations in Alberta or the stringency of Alberta regulations may change due to the Amended Federal Methane Regulations. The Methane Emission Reduction Regulation came into force in Alberta on January 1, 2020, and, along with certain AER Directives, imposes largely the same requirements as the Federal Methane Regulations. The Federal Methane Regulations apply in Ontario and Manitoba but not currently, by equivalency agreements similar to that in effect in Alberta, in British Columbia or Saskatchewan, with the same potential changes which may be required by the Amended Federal Methane Regulations as in Alberta. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 47

2023 was the first compliance period for the federal Clean Fuel Regulations, which requires all producers and importers of gasoline and diesel in Canada to reduce or offset the carbon intensity of the fuels they produce or import. The Clean Fuel Regulations are intended to facilitate a decrease in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel used in Canada by approximately 15 percent below 2016 levels by 2030. The potential costs and benefits of the Clean Fuel Regulations to Pembina and its customers are continuing to be assessed. In late 2024, the federal government released proposed regulations that, if adopted, would impose a cap on GHG emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector and the LNG sector. The proposed regulations would establish a cap-and-trade system for prescribed activities, such as onshore and offshore oil and gas production, oil sands production and upgrading, natural gas production and processing, and the production of LNG. GHG emissions from certain activities will be capped while emissions of GHGs from specified industrial activities will be prohibited, unless the operator registers in accordance with the regulations. The proposed regulations contemplate reducing emissions from the oil and gas sector by 35 percent below 2019 levels by 2030 to 2032. The federal government has announced that it anticipates publishing the final regulations in 2025 following public consultations. Additionally, the federal government released the Clean Electricity Regulations on December 17, 2024, which sets limits on the amount of CO 2 that is emitted during the generation of electricity from fossil fuels. Alberta currently satisfies federal requirements with respect to output-based carbon pricing for large emitters but has been and continues to be subject to the federal fuel charge pursuant to the GGPPA, beginning as of January 1, 2020. The Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction Regulation ("TIER") is Alberta's output-based carbon pricing regime for large emitters. The TIER facilitates emissions reductions for facilities that emitted 100,000 tonnes of GHGs or more in 2016 or any subsequent year. The TIER also allows facilities emitting less than 100,000 tonnes of GHGs but more than 2,000 tonnes of GHGs to opt-in as a regulated facility. Facilities which are subject to the TIER are exempt from the federal output-based carbon price included in the GGPPA as the regimes are currently deemed equivalent. Amendments to the TIER came into force on January 1, 2023 and include, among other things, the addition of emissions associated with flaring to the regulated emissions of aggregate oil and gas facilities and the annual tightening of emission reduction benchmarks. As at December 31, 2024, Pembina had eleven TIER large final emitter facilities, including the Alberta section of the Alliance Pipeline, and five TIER aggregate facilities. At present, the operational and financial impacts of TIER are anticipated to increase over the next five years, due to annual increases in both carbon pricing and stringency of emissions performance benchmarks. As more facilities expand and increase production, it is anticipated that additional facilities will become subject to the TIER. The potential costs and benefits to Pembina of those facilities under the TIER are continuing to be assessed. In British Columbia, a newly designed output-based pricing system ("B.C. OBPS") was introduced on April 1, 2024, replacing the Clean B.C. Industrial Incentive Program. The B.C. OBPS ensures that there is a price incentive for industrial emitters to reduce GHG emissions, while also seeking to promote innovation and protect competitiveness. Pembina has four facilities subject to the B.C. OBPS, including the B.C. section of the Alliance Pipeline. The financial impacts of this new program on Pembina and its facilities are still being determined. In Saskatchewan, an output-based performance standards ("SK OBPS") program came into effect in 2019. Similar to the B.C. OBPS, it is an intensity-based program in which covered facilities are required to meet an established intensity benchmark. The SK OBPS program was expanded in 2020 and updated in 2023, covering more industrial sectors including the natural gas pipeline sector. Pembina has four facilities subject to the SK OBPS, including the Saskatchewan section of the Alliance Pipeline, which became covered under this program in 2023. The financial impacts of the SK OBPS program on Pembina and its facilities are expected to increase over the next five years. 48 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

The Government of Alberta, in its climate change legislation and guidelines, has legislated an overall cap on oil sands GHG emissions. The legislated emissions cap on oil sands operations has been set to a maximum of 100 megatonnes of CO 2 e in any year, which excludes new upgrading capacity and existing upgrader expansions, up to a combined maximum of 10 million tonnes of CO 2 e , and the electricity portion of cogeneration. Oil sands operations emitted approximately 82 megatonnes of CO 2 e in 2023. This legislated cap may limit oil sands production growth in the future, and its interaction with the proposed federal oil and gas sector emissions cap is unknown at this time. Pembina is subject to regulation by the AER under the AER's liability management framework, including the Licensee Management Program, the Inventory Reduction Program, the Licensee Liability Rating Program and the Large Facility Liability Management Program. Directive 088, which came into force in 2021, is replacing the AER's current Licensee Liability Rating Program over time. Directive 088 institutes a holistic assessment regime with several different regulatory tools not limited to the current use of security deposits. This holistic regime currently applies to license transfers and has implemented the Inventory Reduction Program. Under the Inventory Reduction Program, which became effective in 2022, all licensees that have liability associated with inactive infrastructure are required to spend a specified amount each year on reclamation activities, or post equivalent security with the AER. Pembina is subject to regulation by the BCER under the Permittee Capability Assessment program ("PCA Program"), which became effective in 2022. The PCA Program is similar to the intent of the AER's Directive 088 to assess licensees holistically. It assesses the overall risk of the licensee by examining both financial health measures and deemed liabilities. Licensees are then required to provide security deposits or reduce their deemed liabilities such that their assessed risk under the PCA Program is reduced to zero in a given year. Failure to do so may restrict the licensee's ability to transfer licenses or result in enforcement action by the BCER. Pursuant to the Energy Statutes Amendment Act, 2022 (British Columbia), the BCER has broadened authority to impose liability for cleanup, restoration and management of oil and gas infrastructure sites on directors and/or officers of a current or former permittee, or on a "responsible person", which is broadly defined to include those holding a legal or beneficial interest in petroleum or natural gas rights, production or profits associated with the oil and gas activity at issue, among others. As of June 1, 2024, the PCA Program was expanded to include dormant facilities and pipelines. Policy reviews relating to climate change, liability management and other environmental issues are ongoing in the jurisdictions in which Pembina operates. Through active participation with industry associations and direct engagement with regulatory bodies, Pembina will continue to monitor and assess for material impacts to Pembina's business as regulations and policies continue to be developed. While Pembina believes its current operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, there can be no assurance that substantial costs or liabilities will not be incurred as a result of non-compliance with such laws. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as changes in environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and enforcement policies thereunder, including with respect to climate change, claims for damages to persons or property resulting from Pembina's operations, and the discovery of pre-existing environmental liabilities in relation to Pembina's existing or future properties or operations, could result in significant costs and liabilities to Pembina. If Pembina is not able to recover the resulting costs or increased costs through insurance or increased tolls, cash flow available to pay dividends to Shareholders and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and Pembina's other debt obligations could be adversely affected. Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations and legislation, including with respect to climate change, may also impact Pembina's customers and could result in crude oil and natural gas development and production becoming uneconomical, which would impact throughput and revenue on Pembina's systems and in its facilities. See " Risks Inherent in Pembina's Business – Reserve Replacement, Throughput and Product Demand " above. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 49

While Pembina maintains insurance for damage caused by seepage or pollution from its pipelines or facilities in an amount it considers prudent and in accordance with industry standards, certain provisions of such insurance may limit the availability thereof in respect of certain occurrences unless they are discovered within fixed time periods, which typically range from 72 hours to 30 days. Although Pembina believes it has adequate pipeline monitoring systems in place to monitor for a significant spill of product, if Pembina is unaware of a problem or is unable to locate the problem within the relevant time period, insurance coverage may lapse and may not be available. Abandonment Costs Pembina is responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the dismantling, decommissioning, environmental, reclamation and remediation activities associated with abandonment of its pipeline systems and other assets at the end of their economic life, and these abandonment costs may be significant. An accounting provision is made for the estimated cost of site restoration and such cost is either capitalized in the relevant asset category or applied directly to profit and loss. A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, Pembina has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Pembina's estimates of the costs of such abandonment or decommissioning could be materially different than the actual costs incurred. For more information with respect to Pembina's estimated net present value of decommissioning obligations, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The proceeds from the disposition of certain assets, including in respect of certain pipeline systems and line fill, may be available to offset abandonment costs. Pembina may, in the future, determine it prudent or be required by applicable laws or regulations to establish and fund additional reclamation funds to provide for payment of future abandonment costs. Such reserves could decrease cash flow available to pay for dividends to Shareholders and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and Pembina's other debt obligations. To the best of its knowledge, Pembina has complied in all material respects with CER requirements relative to its wholly- owned CER-regulated pipelines for abandonment funding and has completed the compliance-based filings that are required under the applicable CER rules and regulations regarding the abandonment of its pipeline systems and assets. Pembina also has ownership in CER-regulated pipelines including in respect of the Alliance Pipeline, the Tupper pipelines and the Kerrobert pipeline. Pembina, and its joint venture partner, in the case of the Tupper pipelines, is responsible for the abandonment funding and the submission of the CER-compliance based filings for those CER-regulated pipelines. Every five years, the CER reviews the amount of funds that companies must set aside to pay for future abandonment of their pipeline systems. Most recently, the CER completed a review of the abandonment funding calculations and obligations on March 27, 2024. Pembina continues to complete the annual reporting as required by the CER and meet the funding obligations imposed by the CER. Operating and Capital Costs The operating and capital costs of Pembina's assets may vary considerably from current and forecasted values and rates and represent significant components of the cost of providing service. In general, as equipment ages, costs associated with such equipment may increase over time. In addition, operating and capital costs may increase as a result of a number of factors beyond Pembina's control, including general economic, business and market conditions and supply, demand and/or inflation in respect of required goods and/or services. Dividends may be reduced if significant increases in operating or capital costs are incurred and this may also impact the ability of Pembina to service obligations under its debt securities and other debt obligations. Although certain operating costs are recaptured through the tolls charged on natural gas volumes processed and crude oil and NGL transported, respectively, to the extent such tolls escalate, producers may seek lower cost alternatives or stop production of their crude oil and/or natural gas. 50 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Hedging Activities The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy to assist in managing the exposure to commodity price, interest rate, cost of power and foreign exchange risks. As an example of commodity price mitigation, the Company actively fixes a portion of its exposure to fractionation margins through the use of derivative financial instruments. Additionally, Pembina's Marketing business is also exposed to variability in quality, time and location differentials for various products, and financial instruments may be used to offset the Company's exposures to these differentials. However, these hedging arrangements may expose the Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances and there is no guarantee that such hedging arrangements and other efforts to manage market and inventory risks will generate profits or mitigate all of the market and inventory risk associated with Pembina's business. Further, certain hedging arrangements may limit the benefit the Company would otherwise receive from increases in commodity price, decreases in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates, and may expose Pembina to credit risks associated with counterparties with whom the Company has contracts. The Company does not trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. Commodity price fluctuations and volatility can also impact producer activity and throughput in Pembina's infrastructure, which is discussed in more detail above. For more information with respect to Pembina's financial instruments and financial risk management program, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks Relating to NGL by Rail Pembina's operations include rail loading, offloading and terminalling facilities. Pembina relies on railroads and trucks to distribute its products for customers and to transport raw materials to its processing facilities. Costs for environmental damage, damage to property and/or personal injury in the event of a railway incident involving hydrocarbons have the potential to be significant. At this time, the Railway Safety Act (Canada), which governs the operation of railway equipment, does not contemplate regulatory enforcement proceedings against shippers, but consignors and shippers may be subject to regulatory proceedings under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act (Canada), which specifies, among other things, the obligations of shippers to identify and classify dangerous goods, select appropriate equipment and prepare shipping documentation. While the Canada Transportation Act was amended in 2015 to preclude railway companies from shifting liability for third-party claims to shippers by tariff publication alone, major Canadian railways have adopted standard contract provisions designed to implement such a shift. Under various environmental statutes in both Canada and the U.S., Pembina could be held responsible for environmental damage caused by hydrocarbons loaded at its facilities or being carried on its leased rail cars. Pembina partially mitigates this risk by securing insurance coverage, but such insurance coverage may not be adequate in the event of an incident. Railway incidents in Canada and the U.S. have prompted regulatory bodies to initiate reviews of transportation rules and publish various directives. Regulators in Canada and the U.S. have begun to phase-in more stringent engineering standards for tank cars used to move hydrocarbon products, which require all North American tank cars carrying crude oil or ethanol to be retrofitted and all tank cars carrying flammable liquids to be compliant in accordance with the required regulatory timelines. In addition, in 2020, the Government of Canada directed industry to review and update the rules regarding the transportation of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas. While most legislative and regulatory changes apply directly to railway companies, costs associated with retrofitting locomotives and rail cars, implementing safety systems, increased inspection and reporting requirements may be indirectly passed on to Pembina through increased freight rates and car leasing costs. In addition, regulators in Canada and the U.S. have implemented changes that impose obligations directly on consignors and shippers, such as Pembina, relating to the certification of product, equipment procedures and emergency response procedures. In the event that Pembina is ultimately held liable for any damages resulting from its activities relating to transporting NGL by rail, for which insurance is not available, or increased costs or obligations are imposed on Pembina as a result of new regulations, this could have an impact on Pembina's business, operations and prospects and could impact earnings and cash flow available to pay dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 51

Page 53
Risks Related to Diluent Usage in the Oil Sands Oil sands production continues to rely on diluent (primarily condensate) blending to enable transportation of bitumen to markets via pipeline or rail. A shortage, or increase in the price, of diluent may cause oil sands producers' transportation costs to increase, which may result in less demand for the Company's services and have a negative impact on Pembina's financial performance and cash flows. Further, oil sands producers continue to invest in and evaluate technologies and methodologies to reduce the volume of diluent required for product transport. Constraints of diluent supply in the market or increases in diluent costs may accelerate such producers' investments in diluent replacement technologies. A material reduction in diluent demand from oil sands producers, whether as a result of decreased supply, or increased prices, of diluent or due to the successful implementation of diluent reduction technologies, could reduce volumes shipped on Pembina's pipeline assets and reduce demand for capacity at certain of Pembina's facilities particularly for fractionation services, which could, in either case, have a negative impact on Pembina's financial performance and cash flows . Risk Factors Relating to the Securities of Pembina Dilution of Shareholders Pembina is authorized to issue, among other classes of shares, an unlimited number of Common Shares for consideration on terms and conditions as established by the Board of Directors without the approval of Shareholders in certain instances. Existing Shareholders have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuances. Any issuance of Common Shares may have a dilutive effect on existing Shareholders. Risk Factors Relating to the Activities of Pembina and the Ownership of Securities The following is a list of certain risk factors relating to the activities of Pembina and the ownership of its securities: • the level of Pembina's indebtedness from time to time could impair Pembina's ability to obtain additional financing on a timely basis to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, which may have an adverse effect on the value of Pembina's securities; • the uncertainty of future dividend payments by Pembina and the level thereof, as Pembina's dividend practices and the funds available for the payment of dividends from time to time will be dependent upon, among other things, operating cash flow generated by Pembina and its subsidiaries, financial requirements for Pembina's operations, the execution of its growth strategy and the satisfaction of solvency tests imposed by the ABCA for the declaration and payment of dividends; • Pembina may make future acquisitions or may enter into financings or other transactions involving the issuance of securities of Pembina which may be dilutive to the holders of Pembina's securities; • the inability of Pembina to manage growth effectively, and realize the anticipated growth opportunities from acquisitions and new projects, could have an adverse impact on Pembina's business, operations and prospects, which may also have an adverse effect on the value of Pembina's securities; and • the market value of the Common Shares may deteriorate materially if Pembina is unable to maintain its cash dividend practices or make cash dividends in the future. 52 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 54
Market Value of Common Shares and Other Securities Pembina cannot predict at what price the Common Shares, Class A Preferred Shares or other securities issued by Pembina will trade in the future. Common Shares, Class A Preferred Shares and other securities of Pembina will not necessarily trade at values determined solely by reference to the underlying value of Pembina's assets. One of the factors that may influence the market price of the Common Shares and the Class A Preferred Shares is the annual dividend yield of such securities. An increase in interest rates may lead holders and/or purchasers of Common Shares or Class A Preferred Shares to demand a higher annual dividend yield, which could adversely affect the market price of the Common Shares or Class A Preferred Shares. In addition, the market price for Common Shares, Class A Preferred Shares and other securities of Pembina may be affected by announcements of new developments, changes in Pembina's operating results, failure to meet analysts' expectations, changes in credit ratings, changes in general market conditions, fluctuations in the market for equity or debt securities and other factors beyond the control of Pembina. There can be no assurance that the market price of the Common Shares, Class A Preferred Shares and other securities of Pembina will not experience significant fluctuations in the future, including fluctuations that are unrelated to Pembina's performance. For these reasons, investors should not rely on past trends in the price of Common Shares, Class A Preferred Shares or other securities issued by Pembina to predict the future price of Common Shares or Class A Preferred Shares or Pembina's financial results. Accordingly, holders are encouraged to obtain independent legal, tax and investment advice with respect to the holding of Common Shares or Class A Preferred Shares and other securities issued by Pembina. General Risk Factors Health and Safety The operation of Pembina's business is subject to hazards of gathering, processing, transporting, fractionating, storing and marketing hydrocarbon products. Such hazards include, but are not limited to: blowouts; fires; explosions; gaseous leaks, including sour gas; migration of harmful substances; oil spills; corrosion; and acts of vandalism and terrorism. These hazards may interrupt operations, impact Pembina's reputation, cause loss of life or personal injury to the Company's workers or contractors, result in loss of or damage to equipment, property, information technology systems, related data and control systems or cause environmental damage that may include polluting water, land or air. Further, several of the Company's pipeline systems and related assets are operated in close proximity to populated areas and a major incident could result in injury or loss of life to members of the public. A public safety incident could also result in reputational damage to the Company, material repair costs or increased costs of operating and insuring Pembina's assets. Cybersecurity Pembina's technology infrastructure, technologies and data are becoming increasingly integrated. Such integration creates a risk that the failure of one system, including due to factors such as telecommunication failures, cyber-terrorism, security breaches and intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, could lead to failure of other systems which may also have an impact on the Company's physical assets and its ability to safely operate such assets. Furthermore, Pembina and its third- party vendors collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of business, including personal identification information of employees as well as proprietary business information and that of the Company's customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. Notable cybersecurity threats include unauthorized access to information technology systems due to hacking, viruses, cyber phishing attacks and other causes that can result in service disruptions, system failures and unauthorized access to confidential business information. Due to Pembina's high level of technological integration, such an attack on the information technology systems of one segment or asset of Pembina could have a material adverse effect on the broader business, operations or financial results of the Company. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 53

Page 55
A breach in the security or failure of Pembina's information technology could result in operational outages, delays, damage to assets or the environment, reputational harm, increased vulnerability to fraud or extortion, lost profits, compromised or otherwise unusable internal systems, lost data and other adverse outcomes for which Pembina could be held liable, all of which could adversely affect Pembina's reputation, business, operations or financial results. As a result of a cyber-attack or security breach, Pembina could also be liable under laws that protect the privacy of personal information or subject to regulatory penalties. As a result of the critical nature of energy infrastructure and Pembina's use of information systems and other digital technologies to control its assets, Pembina faces an increased risk of cyber-attacks. Cyber threat actors have attacked and threatened to attack energy infrastructure, and various government agencies have increasingly stressed that these attacks are targeting critical infrastructure, and are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. New cybersecurity legislation, regulations and orders have been recently implemented or proposed resulting in additional actual and anticipated regulatory oversight and compliance requirements, which is expected to require significant internal and external resources. Pembina cannot predict the potential impact to its business of potential future legislation, regulations or orders relating to cybersecurity. Furthermore, media reports about a cyber-attack or other significant security incident affecting the Company, whether accurate or not, or, under certain circumstances, Pembina's failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, law enforcement, other regulatory agencies or affected individuals following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or otherwise, could negatively impact its operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to Pembina's reputation or competitiveness, harm to its relationships with customers, partners, suppliers and other third parties, interruption to its management, remediation or increased protection costs, significant litigation or regulatory action, fines or penalties, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, operations, reputation or financial results. Artificial Intelligence Pembina's infrastructure, technologies and data may integrate the use of artificial intelligence ("AI"), which presents certain risks, challenges and unintended consequences that could impact Pembina's business and operations. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed, and dependence on AI for decision-making, without adequate safeguards, could introduce operational vulnerabilities by generating inaccurate outcomes or unintended results based on deficiencies in underlying data. The use of AI also carries inherent risks related to data privacy and cybersecurity, including the potential for intended or unintended transmission of proprietary or sensitive information. AI tools may rely on datasets that include content subject to license, copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual property protections, raising potential compliance concerns. The legal and regulatory framework for AI remains uncertain and under development, with potential liability risks related to breaches of intellectual property or privacy rights. As new AI laws and regulations develop, Pembina's obligation to comply could result in significant costs, impact its business or limit the incorporation of certain AI capabilities into its operations . 54 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 56
Additional Financing and Capital Resources The timing and amount of Pembina's capital expenditures and contributions to equity accounted investees, and the ability of Pembina to repay or refinance existing debt as it becomes due, directly affects the amount of cash available for Pembina to pay dividends. Future acquisitions, expansions of Pembina's assets, other capital expenditures and the repayment or refinancing of existing debt as it becomes due may be financed from sources such as cash generated from operations, the issuance of additional Common Shares, Class A Preferred Shares or other securities (including debt securities) of Pembina and borrowings. Dividends may be reduced, or even eliminated, at times when significant capital or other expenditures are made. There can be no assurance that sufficient capital will be available on terms acceptable to Pembina, or at all, to make additional investments, fund future expansions or make other required capital expenditures. During periods of weakness in the global economy, and, in particular, the commodity-related industry sectors, Pembina may experience restricted access to capital and increased borrowing costs. The ability of Pembina to raise capital depends on, among other factors, the overall state of capital markets, Pembina's credit rating, investor demand for investments in the energy industry generally and demand for Pembina's securities specifically. To the extent that external sources of capital, including the proceeds from the issuance of additional Common Shares, Class A Preferred Shares or other securities or the availability of additional credit facilities, become limited or unavailable on acceptable terms, or at all, due to credit market conditions or otherwise, Pembina's ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand its operations, to repay outstanding debt or to invest in assets, as the case may be, may be impaired. To the extent Pembina is required to use operating cash flow to finance capital expenditures or acquisitions or to repay existing debt as it becomes due, the level of dividends payable may be reduced. Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty credit risk represents the financial loss Pembina may experience if a counterparty to a financial instrument or commercial agreement fails to meet its contractual obligations to Pembina in accordance with the terms and conditions of such instruments or agreements with Pembina. Counterparty credit risk arises primarily from Pembina's short-term investments, trade and other receivables, advances to related parties and from counterparties to its derivative financial instruments. Pembina continues to closely monitor and reassess the creditworthiness of its counterparties, including financial institutions. Pembina may reduce or mitigate its exposure to certain counterparties where it is deemed warranted and permitted under contractual terms. Pembina manages counterparty credit risk through established credit management techniques, including conducting comprehensive financial and other assessments on all high exposure new counterparties. Pembina utilizes various sources of financial, credit and business information in assessing the creditworthiness of a counterparty, including external credit ratings, where available, and, in other cases, detailed financial statement analysis in order to generate an internal credit rating based on quantitative and qualitative factors. The establishment of counterparty exposure limits is governed by a Board-designated counterparty exposure limit matrix which represents the maximum dollar amounts of counterparty exposure by debt rating that can be approved for a particular counterparty. While Pembina takes active steps to monitor and manage its counterparty credit risk, its credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate counterparty credit risk and Pembina cannot predict to what extent Pembina's business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in the creditworthiness of its customers, vendors or counterparties. Further, it is possible that payment or performance defaults from these parties, if significant, could adversely affect Pembina's earnings, cash flows and financial results. Financial assurances from counterparties may include guarantees, letters of credit and cash. As at December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $276 million (2023: $124 million) were held primarily in respect of customer trade receivables. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 55

Page 57
Pembina has typically collected its receivables in full. As at December 31, 2024, approximately 99 percent (2023: 98 percent) of receivables were current. Pembina has a general lien and a continuing and first priority security interest in, and a secured charge on, all of a shipper's petroleum products in its custody. The risk of non-collection is considered to be low and no material impairment of trade and other receivables has been made as of the date hereof. Pembina monitors and manages its concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis. Pembina also evaluates counterparty risk from the perspective of future exposure with existing or new counterparties that support future capital expansion projects. Pembina believes these measures are prudent and allow for effective management of its counterparty credit risk but there is no certainty that they will protect Pembina against all material losses. As part of its ongoing operations, Pembina must balance its market and counterparty credit risks when making business decisions. Debt Service As at December 31, 2024, Pembina had exposure to floating interest rates on approximately $788 million (2023: $747 million) in debt. Pembina has entered into certain derivative financial instruments to manage the Company's exposure to floating interest rates. Pembina and its subsidiaries are permitted to borrow funds to finance the purchase of pipelines and other energy infrastructure assets, to fund capital expenditures or other financial obligations or expenditures in respect of such assets and for working capital purposes. Amounts paid in respect of interest and principal on debt incurred in respect of those assets reduce the amount of cash flow available for dividends on the Common Shares and Class A Preferred Shares. Pembina is also required to meet certain financial covenants under the credit facilities and is subject to customary restrictions on its operations and activities, including restrictions on the granting of security, incurring indebtedness and the sale of its assets. In addition, the borrowing costs under the SLL Credit Facility are based on Pembina's performance relative to a GHG emissions intensity reduction performance target. To the extent that Pembina is unable to meet that GHG emissions intensity reduction performance target, or the annual intermediate GHG emissions intensity reduction targets, Pembina's borrowing costs under the SLL Credit Facility will increase, which may adversely affect Pembina's financial position. The lenders under Pembina's credit facilities have been provided with guarantees and subordination agreements. If Pembina becomes unable to pay its debt service charges or otherwise commits an event of default, payments to the lenders under its credit facilities will rank in priority to dividends. Although Pembina believes its existing credit facilities are sufficient for its immediate liquidity requirements, there can be no assurance that the amount available thereunder will be adequate for the future financial obligations of Pembina or that additional funds will be able to be obtained on terms acceptable to Pembina, or at all. Credit Ratings Rating agencies regularly evaluate Pembina and base their ratings of Pembina's long-term and short-term debt and Class A Preferred Shares on a number of factors. These factors include Pembina's financial strength as well as factors not entirely within Pembina's control, including conditions affecting the industry in which Pembina operates generally and the wider state of the economy. A credit rating downgrade could also limit Pembina’s access to debt and preferred share markets. Pembina's borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are also directly impacted by its credit ratings. Credit ratings may also be important to suppliers or counterparties when they seek to engage in certain transactions with Pembina. A credit rating downgrade may impair Pembina's ability to enter into arrangements with suppliers or counterparties, engage in certain transactions, limit Pembina's access to private and public credit markets or increase the costs of borrowing under its existing credit facilities. There can be no assurance that one or more of Pembina's credit ratings will not be downgraded. 56 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 58
Reliance on Management, Key Individuals and a Skilled Workforce Pembina is dependent on senior management and directors of the Company in respect of the governance, administration and management of all matters relating to Pembina and its operations and administration. The loss of the services of key individuals could have a detrimental effect on Pembina and the Company might not be able to find replacements on a timely basis or with the same level of skill and experience. In addition, Pembina's operations require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, including engineers, technical personnel and other professionals. Pembina competes with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce. If the Company is unable to retain current employees and/or recruit new employees of comparable skill, knowledge and experience, Pembina's business and operations could be negatively impacted. The costs associated with retaining and recruiting key individuals and a skilled workforce could adversely affect Pembina's business opportunities and financial results and there is no assurance that Pembina will continue to attract and retain all personnel necessary for the development and operation of its business. Indigenous Land Claims and Consultation Obligations Indigenous people have claimed title and rights to a considerable portion of the lands in western Canada. The successful assertion of Indigenous title or other Indigenous rights claims may have an adverse effect on western Canadian crude oil and natural gas production or oil sands development and may result in reduced demand for Pembina's assets and infrastructure that service those areas, which could have a material adverse effect on Pembina's business and operations. In Canada, the federal and provincial governments (the "Crown") have a duty to consult and, when appropriate, accommodate Indigenous peoples when the interests of the Indigenous peoples may be affected by a Crown action or decision. Crown actions include the decision to issue a regulatory approval relating to activities that may impact Indigenous rights, interests or lands. The Crown may rely on steps undertaken by a regulatory agency to fulfill its duty to consult and accommodate in whole or in part. Therefore, the processes established by regulatory bodies, such as the AER, the BCER, the BCEAO and the CER, often include an assessment of Indigenous rights claims and consultation obligations. While the Crown holds ultimate responsibility for ensuring consultation is adequate, this issue is often a major aspect of regulatory permitting processes. If a regulatory body, or the Crown itself, determines that the duty to consult has not been appropriately discharged relative to the issuance of regulatory approvals required by Pembina, the issuance of such approvals may be delayed or denied, thereby impacting Pembina's Canadian operations. As described in " Regulation and Legislation " above, the CER Act, IAA, and associated amendments to the Fisheries Act (Canada) and the Canadian Navigable Waters Act (Canada) replaced previously applicable regimes in 2019. A number of the federal regulatory process amendments pertained to the participation of Indigenous groups and the protection of Indigenous and treaty rights. The now-current legislation generally codifies existing law and practice with respect to these matters. For example, decision makers are now expressly required to consider the effects (positive or negative) of a proposed project on constitutionally-protected Indigenous rights, as well as Indigenous peoples themselves, and ensure that consultation is undertaken during the planning phase of impact assessment processes. The legislation also creates a larger role for Indigenous governing bodies in the impact assessment process (enabling the delegation of certain aspects of the impact assessment process to such groups) and requires decision makers to consider Indigenous traditional knowledge in certain cases. The federal government is advancing recognition of Indigenous rights across Canada. As part of these efforts, the federal government enacted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act ("UNDRIP") on June 21, 2021, with the purpose of affirming the application of the UNDRIP in Canadian law. The federal government published its UNDRIP Action Plan on June 21, 2023, which is comprised of 181 guiding measures spanning the 2023-2028 period. Structurally similar legislation, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act ("DRIPA"), was enacted by British Columbia in 2019. Courts have not, to date, found that these laws create new substantive rights which might impact the development activities of Pembina or its customers. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 57

Page 59
The DRIPA is just one piece of the Government of British Columbia's strategy to include greater First Nation involvement in regulatory decision-making. The recognition of Indigenous rights is also facilitated by the renewed British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act (the "EA Act") that came into force in late 2019. The EA Act is designed as a "consent-based" environmental assessment model and is intended to support reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and the implementation of the UNDRIP. The legislation requires the BCEAO to seek participating Indigenous groups' consent with respect to, among other things, the decision to issue an environmental assessment certificate to a given project. While the EA Act does not strictly require consent in most cases, the legislation creates significant participation opportunities for Indigenous groups during environmental assessments. Furthermore, the Government of British Columbia is beginning to explore bilateral "Consent Decision-Making Agreements" under the DRIPA which require First Nation consent for certain resource development projects, including having completed two of such agreements since June 6, 2022. These developments may increase the time required to obtain regulatory approvals or the risk of such approvals and thereby impact Pembina's operations in British Columbia. Pembina continues to actively monitor the development of the regulations required to facilitate the implementation of the UNDRIP Act, DRIPA, EA Act and the impact that other federal and provincial government initiatives on Indigenous rights may have on its business. In addition, Pembina is monitoring the impact of the recent judgments of the Supreme Court of British Columbia with respect to First Nation claims as well as similar developments in Alberta, including the judgment in favour of the Blueberry River First Nation ("BRFN") against the Province of British Columbia relating to the cumulative impact of industrial development within the BRFN treaty area, the judgment in favour of Saik'uz First Nation and Stellat'en First Nation in nuisance against the Crown and private company Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., and the judgment in favour of the Gitxaala Nation and Ehattesahet First Nation requiring consultation prior to staking mineral claims. The judgments have contributed and may further contribute to the acceleration of the Government of British Columbia's imposition of additional requirements to obtain regulatory approvals for developing pipelines or associated facilities, and in some instances restrictions on those approvals, and could cause delays, suspensions, or deferrals in the development of such facilities. The recent judgments may also impact the current and future activities of producers operating in British Columbia and cause them to decrease production, which could, in turn, reduce such producers' demand for Pembina's existing pipeline capacity and processing assets, and may have an adverse effect on Pembina's business. On January 18, 2023, the Government of British Columbia and BRFN announced that they had entered into the Blueberry River First Nations Implementation Agreement in response to the BRFN decision. The agreement creates a framework for how resource development may continue within the BRFN claim area, which includes, among other things, limiting new surface disturbances from oil and gas development in BRFN's claim area to 750 hectares per year while a long- term cumulative effects management regime is developed and implemented. The Government of British Columbia has also reached interim agreements with four other Treaty 8 First Nations which commit to a similar development of a revised approach to environmental assessment in their territories. Duncan's First Nation in Alberta has also filed a claim similar to that of BRFN regarding cumulative impacts in Northwestern Alberta. Pembina continues to actively monitor regulatory developments relating to Indigenous claims in British Columbia and Alberta; however, Pembina cannot predict future regulatory changes that may arise to address the Court's decisions in these or future cases and any such regulatory changes could impact the operations of Pembina and Pembina's customers. Potential Conflicts of Interest Shareholders and other securityholders of Pembina are dependent on senior management and the directors of Pembina for the governance, administration and management of Pembina. Certain directors and officers of Pembina may be directors or officers of entities in competition to Pembina or may be directors or officers of certain entities in which Pembina holds an equity investment in. As such, certain directors or officers of Pembina may encounter conflicts of interest in the administration of their duties with respect to Pembina. Pembina mitigates this risk by requiring directors and officers to disclose the existence of potential conflicts in accordance with Pembina's Code of Ethics Policy and in accordance with the ABCA. 58 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Litigation In the course of their business, Pembina and its various subsidiaries and affiliates may be subject to lawsuits and other claims, including with respect to Pembina's growth or expansion projects. In recent years, there has been an increase in climate and disclosure-related litigation against governments as well as companies involved in the energy industry and there is no assurance that Pembina will not be impacted by such litigation, or by other legal proceedings. Defence and settlement costs associated with such lawsuits and claims may be substantial, even with respect to lawsuits and claims that have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal or other proceeding may have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of Pembina. Changes in Tax Legislation Tax legislation that Pembina is subject to may be amended (or the interpretation of such legislation may change), retroactively or prospectively, resulting in tax consequences that materially differ from those contemplated by Pembina in the jurisdictions in which Pembina has operations, which may create a risk of non-compliance and re-assessment. While Pembina believes that its tax filing positions are appropriate and supportable, it is possible that governing tax authorities may: (i) amend tax legislation (or its interpretation of such legislation may change), or (ii) successfully challenge Pembina's interpretation of tax legislation, either of which could expose Pembina to additional tax liabilities and may affect Pembina's estimate of current and future income taxes and could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and prospects of Pembina and the distributable cash flow available to pay dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations. Foreign Exchange Risk Pembina's cash flows, including a portion of its commodity-related cash flows and certain cash flows from U.S.-based infrastructure assets, are subject to currency risk, arising from the denomination of specific cash flows in U.S. dollars. Additionally, a portion of Pembina's capital expenditures, and contributions or loans to Pembina's U.S.-based investments in equity accounted investees, may be denominated in U.S. dollars. Pembina monitors, assesses and responds to these foreign currency risks using an active risk management program, which may include the exchange of foreign currency for domestic currency at a fixed rate. Political Uncertainty Political and social events and decisions made in Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere, including changes to federal, provincial, state or municipal governments in Canada and the U.S., may create future uncertainty on international and national financial and economic markets. This uncertainty may impact the energy industry in Canada and may have an adverse effect on Pembina's business and financial results. The next Canadian federal election will occur in 2025. Depending on the timing of the election, proposed regulations, such as the proposed oil and gas emissions cap regulation, may not take effect. If a new governing party is elected, there may be a change in the federal government’s approach to climate change policy, thereby impacting regulations that pertain to Pembina’s business activities. Policy changes at the provincial level are also a source of uncertainty. For example, the Government of Alberta introduced various legislative changes pertaining to the generation and transmission of electricity in 2024 and has indicated additional changes are forthcoming. Such changes have created uncertainty with respect to the pace and requirements of future renewables development in Alberta, which could impact renewables projects that Pembina's customers or partners have under development, which might in turn impact, among other things, progress on GHG emissions reduction efforts. Pembina continues to evaluate the impact of any potential changes on its business and to monitor new developments. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 59

Tariffs and Trade Policies Pembina's business could be adversely affected by the imposition of new tariffs or changes to existing tariffs and export or import restrictions. A significant portion of Pembina's revenue is derived from the transportation, processing and marketing of hydrocarbons produced in Canada, and many of Pembina's Canadian customers rely on access, through Pembina's and third party pipelines and facilities, to U.S. markets for the sale of their products. In addition, although a significant portion of Pembina's assets and operations are located in Canada, Pembina also owns and operates assets in the United States. Further, Pembina's Marketing business markets products to customers in both the U.S. and to customers in Canada. Accordingly, the introduction of new trade policies or barriers, including the imposition of new tariffs, duties or other trade restrictions on Canadian hydrocarbon products exported to the U.S., or the imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs, duties or trade restrictions on hydrocarbon products imported into Canada from the U.S., could result in a decrease in, or increase the volatility of, commodity prices and/or price differentials which could, in turn, reduce the demand for Pembina's services and have an adverse effect on Pembina's business, financial condition and results of operations. Pembina continues to monitor developments in Canada-U.S. trade relations closely. However, the Company cannot predict the full impact that changing government policies, legislation or trade disputes may have on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Breach of Confidentiality Pembina regularly enters into confidentiality agreements with third parties prior to the disclosure of any confidential information when discussing potential business relationships or other transactions. Breaches of confidentiality could subject Pembina to competitive risk and may cause significant damage to its business. There is no assurance that, in the event of a breach of confidentiality, Pembina will be able to obtain equitable remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction in a timely manner, if at all, in order to prevent or mitigate any damage to its business that such a breach of confidentiality may cause. Concentration of Assets in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin The majority of Pembina's assets are concentrated in the WCSB, which leaves the company exposed to the economic conditions of that area. Pembina mitigates this risk through a diversity of business activities within the area and by owning and operating assets in the U.S. Impacts of Geopolitical Events While Pembina's operations, based solely in North America, have not been directly impacted to date, global or international geopolitical events such as armed conflict and political instability, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia, and international responses thereto, may have potential wide-ranging consequences for global market volatility and economic conditions, including energy and commodity prices, which may, in turn, increase inflationary pressures and interest rates. The short-, medium- and long-term implications of any such geopolitical events, including potential direct and indirect impacts on Pembina which could have a material and adverse effect on Pembina's business, financial condition and results of operations, are difficult to predict with any certainty. Depending on their extent, duration, and severity, such geopolitical events may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, including, without limitation, the risks relating to Pembina's exposure to commodity prices; the successful completion of Pembina's growth and expansion projects, including the expected return on investment thereof; supply chains and Pembina's ability to obtain required equipment, materials or labour; cybersecurity risks; inflationary pressures; and restricted access to capital and increased borrowing costs as a result of increased interest rates. 60 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 62
Internal Controls Effective internal controls are necessary for Pembina to provide reliable financial reports, manage its risk exposure and help prevent fraud. Although Pembina undertakes numerous procedures to help ensure the reliability of its financial reports, including those imposed by Canadian and U.S. securities laws, Pembina cannot be certain that such measures will ensure that it will maintain adequate control over financial processes and reporting. If Pembina or its independent auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market's confidence in Pembina and its financial statements and negatively impact the trading price of the Common Shares or Class A Preferred Shares. Risks Related to Climate Change Risks Relating to Changing Investor Sentiment in the Oil and Gas Industry A number of factors, including the concerns of the effects of the use of fossil fuels on climate change, concerns of the impact of oil and gas operations on the environment, concerns of environmental damage relating to spills of petroleum products during transportation and concerns of Indigenous rights, have affected certain investors' sentiments towards investing in the oil and gas industry. As a result of these concerns, some investors have announced that they are no longer willing to fund or invest in oil and gas properties or companies and/or are reducing the amount of such investments over time. Additionally, companies across all sectors have been subjected to a heightened level of awareness and scrutiny from institutional, retail and public investors with respect to their ESG practices and, as such, issuers are increasingly being required to develop and implement more robust ESG policies, practices and disclosures. Developing and implementing such policies and practices and preparing such disclosures can involve significant costs and require a significant time commitment from the Board of Directors, management and employees. Failure to implement the policies and practices expected by investors may result in such investors reducing their investment in Pembina or not investing in Pembina at all. Any reduction in the investor base interested or willing to invest in the oil and gas industry and, more specifically, Pembina may result in limits on Pembina's ability to access capital, increases to the cost of capital, a downgrade in Pembina's credit ratings and outlooks, and a decrease in the price and liquidity of Pembina's securities even if Pembina's operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. In May 2024, Pembina published its 2023 Sustainability Report which highlights certain of Pembina's ESG policies and practices, including, but not limited to, energy transition, GHG emissions reduction, employee well-being and culture, health and safety, responsible asset management and Indigenous and community engagement. However, certain investors of Pembina may not be satisfied with the degree and/or speed at which Pembina is implementing and bolstering its ESG policies and practices. If Pembina is unable to meet such investors' expectations, Pembina's business, as well as its reputation, could be adversely affected. Additionally, Pembina may be subject to increased potential liability in connection with its ESG-related disclosures pursuant to legislation restricting "greenwashing", including the interpretation of any such legislation. See "Risk Factors – Risks Inherent to Pembina's Business – Regulation and Legislation". Energy Market Transition Changing consumer preferences, new technologies, government regulation or other external factors may lead to an acceleration away from fossil-based sources of energy, including energy derived from crude oil and natural gas, to renewable and other alternative sources of energy. This may lead to lower global demand for crude oil and natural gas and related commodities and, in turn, may lead to lower prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGL and related commodities. This could negatively impact the Company's producing customers and lead to less demand for Pembina's services, which could negatively impact the revenue the Company receives from, and the value of, its pipelines, facilities and other infrastructure assets, the useful life of those assets and accelerate the timing of decommissioning. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 61

Page 63
In addition, Pembina may invest in opportunities related to an energy transition, which may involve investments in businesses, operations or assets relating to renewable or other alternative forms of energy. Such investments may involve certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those identified herein in respect of Pembina's existing businesses, operations and assets, including the obligation to comply with additional regulatory and other legal requirements associated with such businesses, operations or assets and the potential requirement for additional sources of capital to make, develop and/or maintain such investments and Pembina's ability to access such sources of capital. In the event Pembina were to complete such investments, there can be no guarantee that Pembina will realize a return on those investments or businesses, operations or assets that is similar to the returns it receives in respect of its existing business, operations and assets or that would offset any loss in revenue from, or the value of, the Company's existing pipeline, facilities and other infrastructure assets resulting from the impact of the potential energy transition. As a result, any such investment could reduce the level of cash available for dividends and to service obligations under Pembina's debt securities and other debt obligations and may also negatively impact the trading price of Pembina's securities. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Targets Among other sustainability goals, Pembina has committed to reducing GHG emissions intensity of its operations by 30 percent by 2030 (based on a 2019 baseline year). The Company's ability to lower GHG emissions in respect of its 2030 emissions intensity reduction target is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and Pembina's actions taken to implement these objectives may also expose the Company to certain additional and/or heightened financial and operational risks. A reduction in GHG emissions intensity relies on, among other things, Pembina's ability to implement and improve energy efficiency at all facilities, future development and growth opportunities, development and deployment of new technologies, investment in lower-carbon power and transition to greater use of renewable and lower emission energy sources. In the event that the Company is unable to implement these strategies and technologies as planned without negatively impacting its expected operations or business plans, or in the event that such strategies or technologies do not perform as expected, the Company may be unable to meet its GHG emissions intensity reduction targets or goals on the current timelines, or at all. In addition, achieving the Company's GHG emissions intensity reductions target and goals could require significant capital expenditures and resources, with the potential that the costs required to achieve such target and goals materially differ from Pembina's original estimates and expectations. In addition, while the intent is to improve efficiency and increase the use of renewable and lower-carbon energy, the shift in resources and focus towards GHG emissions reduction could have a negative impact on Pembina's operating results. The overall final cost of investing in and implementing a GHG emissions intensity reduction strategy and technologies in furtherance of such strategy, and the resultant change in the deployment of the Company's resources and focus, could have a material adverse effect on Pembina's business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Weather Conditions Weather conditions (including those associated with climate change) can affect the demand for and price of natural gas and NGL. As a result, changes in weather patterns may affect Pembina's gas processing business. For example, colder winter temperatures generally increase demand for natural gas and NGL used for heating which tends to result in increased throughput volume on the Alliance Pipeline and at the Company's gas processing facilities and higher prices in the processing and storage businesses. Pembina has capacity to handle any such increased volume of throughput and storage at its facilities to meet changes in seasonal demand; however, at any given time, processing and storage capacity is finite. Weather conditions (including those associated with climate change) may impact Pembina's ability to complete capital projects, repairs or facility turnarounds on time, potentially resulting in delays and increased costs. Weather may also affect access to Pembina's facilities, and the operations and projects of Pembina's customers or shippers, which may impact the supply and/or demand for Pembina's services. With respect to construction activities, in areas where construction can be conducted in non-winter months, Pembina attempts to schedule its construction timetables so as to minimize potential delays due to cold winter weather. 62 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 64
Changes and/or extreme variability in weather patterns, including with respect to the impact on the geophysical environment, as well as increases in the frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods, cyclones, hurricanes, droughts and forest fires, increases the potential risk for Pembina's assets, including operational disruptions, transportation difficulties, supply chain disruptions, employee safety incidents, and damage to assets, which may result in lower revenues, higher costs or project delays.

12. NON-GAAP & OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this MD&A, Pembina has disclosed certain financial measures and ratios that are not specified, defined or determined in accordance with GAAP and which are not disclosed in Pembina's financial statements. Non-GAAP financial measures either exclude an amount that is included in, or include an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, together with financial measures and ratios specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP, are used by management to evaluate the performance and cash flows of Pembina and its businesses and to provide additional useful information respecting Pembina's financial performance and cash flows to investors and analysts. In this MD&A, Pembina has disclosed the following non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios: net revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA"), adjusted EBITDA per common share, adjusted EBITDA from equity accounted investees, adjusted cash flow from operating activities and adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios disclosed in this MD&A do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. The financial measures and ratios should not, therefore, be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, measures and ratios of Pembina's financial performance, or cash flows specified, defined or determined in accordance with IFRS, including revenue, earnings, share of profit from equity accounted investees and cash flow from operating activities. Except as otherwise described herein, these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period. Specific reconciling items may only be relevant in certain periods . Below is a description of each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio disclosed in this MD&A, together with, as applicable, disclosure of: the most directly comparable financial measure that is specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP to which each non-GAAP financial measure relates; a quantitative reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to such directly comparable GAAP financial measure; the composition of each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio; an explanation of how each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio provides useful information to investors and the additional purposes, if any, for which management uses each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio; and an explanation of the reason for any change in the label or composition of each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio from what was previously disclosed. Net Revenue Net revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined as total revenue less cost of goods sold. Management believes that net revenue provides investors with a single measure to indicate the margin on sales before non-product operating expenses that is comparable between periods. Management utilizes net revenue to compare consecutive results, to aggregate revenue generated by each of the Company's divisions and to set comparable objectives. The most directly comparable financial measure to net revenue that is specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP and disclosed in Pembina's financial statements is revenue. 3 Months Ended December 31 Pipelines Facilities Marketing & New Ventures (1) Corporate & Inter-segment Eliminations Total (1) ($ millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue 948 737 320 248 1,133 1,030 (256) (179) 2,145 1,836 Cost of goods sold 5 11 — — 919 821 (162) (138) 762 694 Net revenue 943 726 320 248 214 209 (94) (41) 1,383 1,142 (1) Comparative 2023 period has been adjusted.

See "Accounting Policies & Estimates – Change in Accounting Policies" and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per Common Share Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as earnings before net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (included in operations and general and administrative expense), and unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments. The exclusion of unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments eliminates the non-cash impact of such gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA also includes adjustments to earnings for non-controlling interest, losses (gains) on disposal of assets, transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions, dispositions and restructuring, impairment charges or reversals in respect of goodwill, intangible assets, investments in equity accounted investees and property, plant and equipment, certain non-cash provisions and other amounts not reflective of ongoing operations. These additional adjustments are made to exclude various non-cash and other items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. Following completion of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, Pembina revised the definition of adjusted EBITDA to deduct earnings for the 14.6 percent non-controlling interest in the Aux Sable U.S. operations. Pembina's subsequent acquisition of the remaining interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations in the third quarter of 2024 resulted in all of Aux Sable's results being included in the adjusted EBITDA calculation beginning on August 1, 2024. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors as it is an important indicator of Pembina's ability to generate liquidity through cash flow from operating activities and equity accounted investees. Management also believes that adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of operating income generated from capital expenditures, which includes operational finance income and gains from lessor lease arrangements. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by investors and analysts for assessing financial performance and for the purpose of valuing Pembina, including calculating financial and leverage ratios. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to set objectives and as a key performance indicator of the Company's success. Pembina presents adjusted EBITDA as management believes it is a measure frequently used by analysts, investors and other stakeholders in evaluating the Company's financial performance. The most directly comparable financial measure to adjusted EBITDA that is specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP and disclosed in Pembina's financial statements is earnings. Adjusted EBITDA per common share is a non-GAAP ratio which is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.

Adjusted EBITDA from Equity Accounted Investees In accordance with IFRS, Pembina's joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting. Under equity accounting, the assets and liabilities of the investment are presented net in a single line item in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, "Investments in Equity Accounted Investees". Earnings from investments in equity accounted investees are recognized in a single line item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income "Share of Profit from Equity Accounted Investees". The adjustments made to earnings, in adjusted EBITDA above, are also made to share of profit from investments in equity accounted investees. Cash contributions and distributions from investments in equity accounted investees represent Pembina's share paid and received in the period to and from the investments in equity accounted investees. To assist in understanding and evaluating the performance of these investments, Pembina is supplementing the IFRS disclosure with non-GAAP proportionate consolidation of Pembina's interest in the investments in equity accounted investees. Pembina's proportionate interest in equity accounted investees has been included in adjusted EBITDA. 3 Months Ended December 31 Pipelines Facilities Marketing & New Ventures Total ($ millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Share of profit from equity accounted investees — 31 59 48 74 15 133 94 Adjustments to share of profit from equity accounted investees: Net finance costs (income) — 7 37 84 (74) — (37) 91 Income tax expense (recovery) — — 23 (13) — — 23 (13) Depreciation and amortization — 38 66 60 — 6 66 104 Unrealized (gain) loss on commodity-related derivative financial instruments — — (3) 7 — — (3) 7 Transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions and non-cash provisions — — 13 (3) — — 13 (3) Total adjustments to share of profit from equity accounted investees — 45 136 135 (74) 6 62 186 Adjusted EBITDA from equity accounted investees — 76 195 183 — 21 195 280 12 Months Ended December 31 Pipelines Facilities Marketing & New Ventures Total ($ millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Share of profit (loss) from equity accounted investees 42 109 231 233 55 (26) 328 316 Adjustments to share of profit (loss) from equity accounted investees: Net finance costs (income) 7 22 175 160 (23) 1 159 183 Income tax expense — — 73 41 — — 73 41 Depreciation and amortization 39 150 221 207 7 25 267 382 Unrealized loss on commodity-related derivative financial instruments — — 2 16 — — 2 16 Transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions and non-cash provisions — — 15 14 — 58 15 72 Total adjustments to share of profit from equity accounted investees 46 172 486 438 (16) 84 516 694 Adjusted EBITDA from equity accounted investees 88 281 717 671 39 58 844 1,010 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 67

Adjusted Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Adjusted Cash Flow from Operating Activities per Common Share Adjusted cash flow from operating activities is a non-GAAP measure which is defined as cash flow from operating activities adjusting for the change in non-cash operating working capital, adjusting for current tax and share-based compensation payments, and deducting distributions to non-controlling interests and preferred share dividends paid. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities deducts distributions to non-controlling interest and preferred share dividends paid because they are not attributable to common shareholders. The calculation has been modified to include current tax expense and accrued share-based payment expense as it allows management to better assess the obligations discussed below. Management believes that adjusted cash flow from operating activities provides comparable information to investors for assessing financial performance during each reporting period. Management utilizes adjusted cash flow from operating activities to set objectives and as a key performance indicator of the Company's ability to meet interest obligations, dividend payments and other commitments. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share is a non-GAAP financial ratio which is calculated by dividing adjusted cash flow from operating activities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Following completion of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, Pembina revised the definition of adjusted cash flow from operating activities to deduct distributions related to non-controlling interest in the Aux Sable U.S. operations. On August 1, 2024, Pembina acquired the remaining interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations. 3 Months Ended December 31 12 Months Ended December 31 ($ millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cash flow from operating activities 902 880 3,214 2,635 Cash flow from operating activities per common share – basic (dollars) 1.55 1.60 5.61 4.79 Add (deduct): Change in non-cash operating working capital 73 (54) 43 210 Current tax expense (73) (54) (261) (325) Taxes paid, net of foreign exchange 52 49 404 236 Accrued share-based payment expense (3) (44) (82) (67) Share-based compensation payment 5 — 91 77 Preferred share dividends paid (34) (30) (132) (120) Distributions to non-controlling interest — — (12) — Adjusted cash flow from operating activities 922 747 3,265 2,646 Adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share – basic (dollars) 1.59 1.36 5.70 4.81 68 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

The decrease in revenues, earnings and earnings per common share (basic and diluted) between 2023 and 2022 was largely due to lower global energy prices in 2023, Pembina's recognition of the gain on the PGI Transaction in 2022, and the impacts of Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires in 2023. Additionally, there was higher income tax expense in 2023 as 2022 was impacted by the PGI Transaction, lower Share of Profit from Aux Sable and Alliance, and higher general & administrative expense. These factors were partially offset by an impairment reversal related to the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline in 2023, and lower net finance costs. Risk Management Pembina's risk management strategies, policies and limits, ensure risks and exposures are aligned to its business strategy and risk tolerance. Pembina's Board of Directors is responsible for providing risk management oversight at Pembina and oversees how management monitors compliance with Pembina's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of this risk framework in relation to the risks faced by Pembina. Pembina has exposure to counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. Pembina utilizes derivative instruments to stabilize the results of its business and, as at December 31, 2024, the Company has entered into certain financial derivative contracts in order to manage commodity price, interest rate, cost of power and foreign exchange risk. Pembina has also entered into power purchase agreements to secure cost-competitive renewable energy, fix the price for a portion of the power Pembina consumes, and reduce its emissions. Financial Instruments Fair Values The fair value of financial instruments utilizes a variety of valuation inputs. When measuring fair value, Pembina uses observable market data to the greatest extent possible. Depending on the nature of these valuation inputs, financial instruments are categorized as follows: a. Level 1 Level 1 fair values are based on inputs that are unadjusted observable quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities as at the measurement date. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 69

Page 71
b. Level 2 Level 2 fair values are based on inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable. Level 2 fair value inputs include quoted forward market prices, time value, and broker quotes that are observable for the duration of the financial instrument's contractual term. These inputs are often adjusted for factors specific to the asset or liability, such as, location differentials and credit risk. Financial instruments that utilize Level 2 fair valuation inputs, include derivatives arising from physical commodity forward contracts, commodity swaps and options, and forward interest rate and foreign-exchange swaps. In addition, Pembina's loans and borrowings utilize Level 2 fair valuation inputs, whereby the valuation technique is based on discounted future interest and principal payments using the current market interest rates of instruments with similar terms. c. Level 3 Level 3 fair values utilize inputs that are not based on observable market data. Rather, various valuation techniques are used to develop inputs. Financial instruments that utilize Level 3 fair valuation inputs include embedded derivative instruments arising from long-term power purchase agreements. The fair value of long-term power purchase agreements is measured using a pricing and cash flow model that accounts for forward power prices, renewable wind power pricing discounts and differentials, and inflationary metrics. The rate used to discount the respective estimated cash flows is a government risk-free interest rate that is adjusted for an appropriate credit spread. The fair valuation of the embedded derivative instruments is judged to be a significant management estimate. These assumptions and inputs are susceptible to change and may differ from actual future developments. This estimation uncertainty could materially impact the quantified fair value; and therefore, the gains and losses on commodity-related derivative financial instruments. 2024 2023 As at December 31 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value ($ millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets carried at fair value Derivative financial instruments (1) 13 — 13 — 80 — 51 29 Financial liabilities carried at fair value Derivative financial instruments (1) 159 — 42 117 40 — 26 14 Contingent consideration (2) — — — — 39 — — 39 Financial liabilities carried at amortized cost Long-term debt (3) 12,656 — 12,649 — 10,499 — 9,989 — (1) At December 31, 2024 all derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value through earnings, except for $5 million in interest rate derivative financial assets that have been designated as cash flow hedges (2023: $18 million).

(2) Unrealized losses or gains for designated cash flow hedges are recognized in impact of hedging activities in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income, with realized losses or gains being reclassified to net finance costs. As at December 31, 2024 the movement in other comprehensive income includes a realized gain of $17 million (2023: $16 million realized gain). No losses or gains have been recognized in net income relating to discontinued cash flow hedges. Tax Regulations Under Pillar Two legislation, Pembina applies the mandatory exception to recognize and disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The mandatory exception has been applied retrospectively with no material impact to Pembina's Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Pension Plan Pembina maintains defined contribution plans and defined benefit pension plans for employees and retirees. The defined benefit plans include a funded registered plan for all qualified employees and an unfunded supplemental retirement plan for those employees affected by the Canada Revenue Agency maximum pension limits. At the end of 2024, the pension plans carried a net obligation of $8 million (2023: net asset of $9 million). At December 31, 2024, plan obligations amounted to $284 million (2023: $264 million) compared to plan assets of $292 million (2023: $255 million). In 2024, the pension plans' expense was $28 million (2023: $18 million). Pembina's contributions to the pension plans totaled $18 million in 2024 (2023: $17 million). Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Disclosure Controls and Procedures Pembina maintains disclosure controls and procedures ("DC&P") designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in Pembina's annual filings, interim filings and other reports filed or submitted by it under applicable securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and in the time periods specified under such securities laws, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure such information is accumulated and communicated to Pembina's management, including its certifying officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As at December 31, 2024, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Pembina's DC&P, as defined in Rule 13a – 15(e) and 15(d) – 15(e) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended (the "Exchange Act") and National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer's Annual and Interim Filings ("NI 52-109"), was carried out by management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"). Based on the evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the design and operation of Pembina's DC&P were effective as at December 31, 2024 to ensure that material information relating to Pembina is made known to the CEO and CFO by others. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 71

Page 73
It should be noted that while the CEO and CFO believe that Pembina's DC&P provide a reasonable level of assurance that they are effective, they do not expect that Pembina's DC&P will prevent all errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Pembina maintains internal control over financial reporting which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a – 15(e) and 15(d) – 15(e) under the Exchange Act and NI 52-109 . Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as at December 31, 2024 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on management's assessment as at December 31, 2024, the CEO and CFO have concluded that Pembina's internal control over financial reporting is effective. Pembina acquired Enbridge Inc.'s interests in the Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen joint ventures on April 1, 2024. In accordance with the provisions of NI 52-109 and consistent with SEC guidance, the scope of the evaluation did not include internal controls over financial reporting of the Acquirees and were excluded from management's evaluation of the effectiveness of Pembina's internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024. Further details related to the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition are disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As at and for the period ended December 31, 2024, the assets and revenue acquired in the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition represented approximately 19 percent and 17 percent, respectively of Pembina's total assets and revenue. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of Pembina's financial statements would be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as at a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024 was audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, which is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Pembina's internal controls over financial reporting commencing April 1, 2024 include the systems, processes and controls associated with the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, as well as additional controls designed to result in complete and accurate consolidation of the financial information relating to the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition. Other than the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, there has been no change in Pembina's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Pembina's internal control over financial reporting. 72 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT The audited consolidated financial statements of Pembina Pipeline Corporation (the "Company" or "Pembina") are the responsibility of Pembina's management. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, using management's best estimates and judgments, where appropriate. Management is responsible for the reliability and integrity of the financial statements, the notes to the financial statements and other financial information contained in this report. In the preparation of these financial statements, estimates are sometimes necessary because a precise determination of certain assets and liabilities is dependent on future events. Management believes such estimates have been based on careful judgments and have been properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements. Management's Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures ("DC&P") and internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a – 15(e) and 15(d) – 15(e) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings. Under the supervision and with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), management has conducted an evaluation of Pembina's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on management's assessment as at December 31, 2024, the CEO and CFO have concluded that Pembina's internal control over financial reporting is effective. In accordance with the provisions of NI 52-109 and consistent with SEC guidance, the scope of the evaluation did not include internal controls over financial reporting of Alliance/Aux Sable, which Pembina acquired on April 1, 2024, and were excluded from management's evaluation of the effectiveness of Pembina's internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2024. Further details related to the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition are disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As at and for the period ended December 31, 2024, the assets and revenue acquired in the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition represented approximately 19 percent and 17 percent of Pembina's total assets and revenue, respectively. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of Pembina's financial statements would be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as at a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate. The Board of Directors of Pembina (the "Board") is responsible for ensuring management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and internal control. The Board is assisted in exercising its responsibilities through the Audit Committee, which consists of five non-management directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management and the internal and external auditors to satisfy itself that management's responsibilities are properly discharged, to review the financial statements and to recommend approval of the financial statements to the Board. KPMG LLP, the independent auditors, have audited Pembina's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The independent auditors have full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss their audit and their related findings. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 77

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Pembina's internal controls over financial reporting commencing April 1, 2024 include the systems, processes and controls associated with the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, as well as additional controls designed to result in complete and accurate consolidation of the financial information relating to the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition. Other than the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, there has been no change in Pembina's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Pembina's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Pembina Pipeline Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Pembina Pipeline Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the financial performance and its cash flows for each of the years then ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for the gains and losses from physically settled commodity derivatives and financial derivatives that economically hedge commodity derivatives to be presented as 'Revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts' as of January 1, 2023. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Evaluation of the recoverable amount of Pembina Gas Infrastructure Inc. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's equity method investment in Pembina Gas Infrastructure Inc. ("PGI") as of December 31, 2024 was $3,740 million. As discussed in Note 2, the Company records its share of the investee's profit or loss and comprehensive income, which includes any impairment losses recorded by PGI. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, PGI is required to estimate the recoverable amount of its goodwill at least annually, or whenever PGI identifies an impairment indicator. PGI calculated the recoverable amount in its annual goodwill impairment test using a fair value less cost to sell approach based on a discounted cash flow model. No impairment loss was recognized by PGI for the year ended December 31, 2024. We identified the evaluation of the recoverable amount of PGI as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the projected cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets, and after-tax discount rate assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model. Minor changes to those assumptions could have had a significant impact on the assessment of the recoverable amount of PGI and the share of profit recognized by the Company under the equity method of accounting. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter, including controls related to the determination of the projected cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets, and after-tax discount rate assumptions used in the calculation of the recoverable amount. We compared PGI's historical projected cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets to actual historical results to assess PGI's ability to accurately forecast. We evaluated PGI's projected cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets by comparing to actual historical results. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: • testing the recoverable amount for PGI using the investee's projected cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and after-tax discount rate, and comparing the result to the investee’s calculated recoverable amount • evaluating the after-tax discount rate used in the valuation by comparing the inputs against publicly available market data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting after-tax discount rate • evaluating the historical and forecasted cash flow multiples implied in the valuation by comparing them to publicly available historical and forecasted cash flow multiples for comparable entities. Evaluation of the loss on disposition and consideration paid related to the previous investments under the equity method of accounting As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed its acquisition of Enbridge Inc.'s interest in Alliance, Aux Sable and NRGreen joint ventures for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion, net of $327 million of assumed debt. Accounting for the completion of this acquisition resulted in an in-substance disposition at fair value of $2.6 billion for the Company's previous investments, which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting at $2.8 billion, as well as allocated goodwill of $380 million, resulting in a loss on disposition of $616 million. As discussed in Note 2 b) ii), when the Company acquires control of investees of which it previously had joint control, the previously recorded equity investment is remeasured to fair value and recorded as an in-substance disposition. The fair value of the Company's previous equity investment in the entities was determined based on the negotiated purchase price paid, adjusted for identified control synergies measured using a discounted cash flow model. The control synergies include significant estimates for timing, amount, and likelihood. Changes to the estimates of the timing, amount and likelihood of control synergies could impact the fair value of the previously recorded equity investment and therefore the loss on disposition. In addition, the fair value of the previously held equity investment in the entities is included as a component of the purchase price. Changes to the estimates of the timing, amount and likelihood of control synergies could impact the measurement of property, plant and equipment, other assets, deferred tax liabilities, and non-controlling interest. 80 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

We identified the estimate of the control synergies as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the estimates of the timing, amount and likelihood of control synergies. Changes to those estimates could have had a significant impact on the measurement of the consideration paid and the recognized loss on in-substance disposition. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter, including controls related to the determination of the forecasted cash flow assumptions regarding the control synergies, including their amount, timing and likelihood. We assessed the forecasted cash flow assumptions which were used to estimate the value of the control synergies by comparing them to the business forecast approved by the Company's board of directors. We compared the timing, amounts and likelihood of estimated control synergies to historical activities, asset capabilities and existing operations of the acquired entities. We evaluated the amounts of forecasted control synergies by comparing to actual historical results and compared forecasted control synergies to actual control synergies since the date of acquisition to evaluate the amounts and likelihood. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: • evaluating the implied control premium paid to acquire a controlling interest in the previously held equity method investment by comparing publicly available historical control premiums for comparable transactions. /s/ KPMG LLP Chartered Professional Accountants We have served as the Company's auditor since 1997.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Pembina Pipeline Corporation Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Pembina Pipeline Corporation's and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The Company acquired Enbridge Inc.'s interests in the Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen joint ventures during 2024, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen's internal control over financial reporting associated with 19% and 17% of total assets and total revenues, respectively, included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included under the heading Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting on page 72 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 82 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Chartered Professional Accountants Calgary, Canada February 27, 2025 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 83

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. REPORTING ENTITY Pembina Pipeline Corporation ("Pembina" or the "Company") is a Calgary-based, leading transportation and midstream service provider serving North America's energy industry. The audited consolidated financial statements ("Consolidated Financial Statements") include the accounts of Pembina, its subsidiary companies, partnerships and any investments in associates and joint arrangements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Pembina owns an extensive network of strategically located assets which include hydrocarbon liquids and natural gas pipelines, gas gathering and processing facilities, oil and natural gas liquids infrastructure and logistics services, and an export terminals business. Pembina's network of strategically located assets and commercial operations along the majority of the hydrocarbon value chain allow it to offer a full spectrum of midstream and marketing services to the energy sector. 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, Pembina's functional currency, with all values presented in millions, unless otherwise indicated. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). The material accounting policies applied in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below in Note 3 and have been applied consistently to all periods presented. The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by Pembina's Board of Directors on February 27, 2025. a. Basis of Measurement The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis with some exceptions, as detailed in the accounting policies set out below. b. Basis of Consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries together with its interests in joint arrangements. i) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities, including unincorporated entities such as partnerships, controlled by Pembina. The financial results of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date when control ceases. Balances and transactions, including any revenue and expenses, with or between subsidiaries have been eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. When there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the Company derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and other components of equity. However, there is an accounting policy choice to recognize the entirety of any resulting gain or loss in earnings on loss of control or to recognize the gain or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest in the joint venture. Pembina has elected to recognize the full gain in its entirety. As a result, any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Pembina's previous non-controlling interest, which related to the Company's Jordan Cove project, was initially recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. The non-controlling interest was derecognized in 2023 when the related equity interest had expired. The derecognition resulted in a re-classification from non-controlling interest to equity attributable to shareholders. 88 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 90
For the Acquisition (as defined in Note 5), Pembina elected to measure its initial carrying value of the non-controlling interests equal to the proportionate value of the net assets that the non-controlling interests relate to. Non-controlling interests are recognized as a component of equity and are subsequently increased by the proportionate amount of net income or contributions attributable to the non-controlling interest, and decreased by any distributions paid. After initial recognition, if a non-controlling interest is acquired, the non-controlling interest is derecognized. Differences between the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest and the consideration paid are recognized directly in retained earnings, and are not recognized in earnings. Refer to Note 5 for information on Pembina's acquisition of the remaining 14.6 percent interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations ii) Joint Arrangements Joint arrangements represent arrangements where Pembina has joint control established by a contractual agreement. Joint arrangements give rise to either joint operations or joint ventures. The determination of joint control requires significant judgment about each party's substantive rights, exposure to variability of returns, and the power necessary for the party to affect its respective returns. Joint control exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that control the arrangement collectively. Ownership percentage alone may not be a determinant of joint control. Joint Operations Pembina recognizes its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases. Joint Ventures and the Equity Method Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The acquisition of interests in a joint venture that is a business are measured and recorded using the acquisition method. Other acquisitions of interests in a joint venture are measured and recorded at cost. Joint ventures are adjusted thereafter for any change in the Company's share of the investees' net assets. Pembina's Consolidated Financial Statements include its share of the equity accounted investees' profit or loss and comprehensive income until the date that joint control ceases. When Pembina's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest, including any long-term investments, is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that Pembina has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. Distributions from and contributions to investments in equity accounted investees are recognized when received or paid. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated against the investment to the extent of Pembina's interest in the investee. However, unrealized gains that arise in a circumstance where the Company has contributed a business to a joint venture are fully recognized. Losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Business Combinations Achieved in Stages When Pembina acquires control of investees that it previously had joint control or significant influence of, the previously recognized equity investment is remeasured to fair value and recorded as an in-substance disposition, with a corresponding gain or loss recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value on the acquisition date. An allocation of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the net assets disposed, however, the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities previously recognized by Pembina on its investment in the investees is excluded from the measurement of the gain or loss and presented separately. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 89

Page 91
When measuring the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination achieved in stages, the fair value of Pembina's ownership in the investees as well as the fair value of the other previous relationships with the investees are included as part of the consideration paid in exchange for the business. iii) Foreign Currency For each subsidiary and joint venture, Pembina determines the entity's respective functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these entities, whose functional currencies are other than Canadian dollars, are translated into Canadian dollars at the foreign exchange rate as at the reporting date, while revenues and expenses are translated using average monthly foreign exchange rates. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of these entities are included in exchange gain (loss) on translation of foreign operations in other comprehensive income. Judgments are required concerning the entity's economic environment in which it operates and the nature of the cash flows that materialize, with consideration given to the currency that influences sales prices, financing activities, the country whose competitive forces and regulatory environment has the most influence, and the currency that most significantly impacts operating costs and economics. c. Use of Estimates and Judgments The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that are based on facts and circumstances as at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Judgments, estimates, and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Information about estimates and judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is included in the following notes: Judgments • Note 2(b)(ii): Assessment of joint control for joint arrangements; • Note 3(f)(ii): The determination of cash generating units ("CGUs") in the assessment of non-financial asset impairments; and • Note 3(j): Identification of performance obligations in revenue arrangements. Estimates • Note 5: Fair value of previously held interest in the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition; • Note 3(f)(ii): Recoverability of non-financial assets; and • Note 24: Fair value of Level 3 derivative instruments. 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES a. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value and consist primarily of crude oil, natural gas liquids ("NGL") and spare parts that are expected to be used within one year of the financial reporting date. The cost of inventories is determined using the weighted average costing method and includes direct purchase costs and when applicable, costs of production, extraction, fractionation, and transportation. All changes in the measurement of inventories are reflected in earnings. 90 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 92
b. Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, Pembina has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. i) Non-Derivative Financial Assets Pembina initially recognizes trade receivables, loan receivables and cash deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets are recognized on the trade date at which Pembina becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Pembina derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows and the related risks and rewards of ownership in a transaction with a third party. Any remaining interest of a transferred financial asset is recognized as a separate asset or liability. On derecognition, the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received is recognized in earnings. Pembina classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: Financial Assets at Amortized Cost A financial asset is classified in this category if the asset is held for the intention of collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest. At initial recognition, financial assets at amortized cost are recognized at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, these financial assets are recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any expected credit losses and impairment loss allowances. Pembina's non-derivative financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other, and other assets. Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income A financial asset is classified in this category if the asset is held for the intention of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. ii) Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities Pembina's non-derivative financial liabilities are comprised of trade payables and other, loans and borrowings, and other liabilities. Pembina initially recognizes non-derivative financial liabilities at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs, on the trade date at which Pembina becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. After initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Pembina derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. On derecognition, the difference between the carrying value of the liability and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in earnings. Pembina records a modification or exchange of an existing liability as a derecognition of the original financial liability if the terms are substantially different, assessing both qualitative and quantitative factors. In doing so, the original instrument is derecognized with any extinguishment gain or loss recognized in net finance expense, and the modified or exchanged instrument is accounted for as a new instrument. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 91

Page 93
If the expected cashflows of an existing non-derivative liability are modified but the modification is not treated as a derecognition, Pembina adjusts the gross carrying amount of the liability to the present value of the estimated contractual cash flows using the instrument's original effective interest rate, with the difference recorded in earnings. However, if contractual cashflows include variable market interest payments, such as Pembina's revolving credit facilities, the effective interest rate on the instrument is revised at the same time as the revision to the estimated cashflows resulting in no change to the carrying value of the financial liability. iii) Common Share Capital Common shares and share options arising from share-based payment transactions are classified as equity. When the company repurchases its own common shares, share capital is reduced by the average carrying value of the shares repurchased. The excess of the purchase price over the average carrying value is recognized as an increase in deficit. Shares are cancelled upon repurchase. iv) Preferred Share Capital Preferred shares are classified as equity because they bear discretionary dividends and do not contain any obligations to deliver cash or other financial assets. Pembina’s preferred shares include a redemption option that allow Pembina to call the instrument. If Pembina provides a redemption notice to the preferred shareholders, the instrument is reclassified from equity to be a financial liability until the redemption amount is paid and the shares are cancelled. v) Derivative and Hedge Accounting Contracts that meet the definition of a derivative instrument are recorded at fair value through earnings. This includes contracts for the physical delivery of commodities under a purchases and or sale contract where the contract or underlying commodity being delivered is net cash settleable, unless the Company has (a) elected to apply the "own use" (or "normal purchase normal sale") scope exemption, or (b) the derivative instrument has formally been designated as a hedging instrument. To assess whether the own-use scope exemption is appropriate, Pembina uses judgment to evaluate whether (a) the transaction is reasonable in relation to the business needs; and (b) the business has the intent to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item or commodity. Application of the own use scope exemption is reviewed each reporting period to assess whether the qualifying factors continue to be met. Derivative instruments that arise from financial contracts do not qualify for the own use scope exemption as such transactions do not result in physical settlement or delivery of the underlying item or commodity. Rather, these arrangements form part of Pembina's risk management strategy, whereby derivative instruments are used to assist in managing exposure to commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates. All unrealized and realized gains and losses from physical derivative instruments and commodity-related financial derivative instruments (purchases, sales, and related foreign exchange instruments) are recorded on a net basis in revenue as Revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts. All unrealized and realized gains and losses from non-commodity related financial instruments (interest rate and foreign exchange instruments) are included in Net finance costs. Embedded derivatives in other financial instruments or contracts (host instruments) are recorded separately if the following criteria are met: (a) The economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host; (b) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and, (c) the host instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. The embedded derivative can be formally designated as a hedging instrument or recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. 92 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 94
Derivative instruments executed for risk management purposes may be designated as hedging instruments. At the inception and formal designation of the hedge relationship, Pembina documents the following: The relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item; the related risk management strategy and objectives; the nature of the risk being hedged; and, how the Company will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements on an ongoing basis. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or the hedging instrument is sold or terminated. All derivative instruments that have been formally designated as hedging instruments are accounted for and classified as either: (a) cash flow hedges; or (b) net investment hedges. For both classifications, the effective portion of gains or losses is recognized and accumulated in 'other comprehensive income' ("OCI"), while any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in earnings. For Pembina's current cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified into earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction occurs. For net investment hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to earnings on disposal of the foreign operation. c. Property, Plant and Equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are measured initially at cost, or at fair value if acquired as part of a business combination or has been transferred from a customer. Such a fair value is determined using either (a) comparable and observable market values when available, (b) an income approach, or (c) the depreciated replacement cost valuation method. Depreciation is measured on a straight line or declining balance basis over the useful life of the asset, commencing when an asset is placed into service, and is included in cost of sales and general and administrative expense. Estimated useful lives are based on management's assumptions, such as, an asset's economic life and physical life, which can include the relevant commodity reserves in a particular production area that the asset serves. Assets are also assessed to determine whether they may have significant components with different useful lives. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and are subject to revision based on new or additional information. Pembina has assessed the residual values of depreciable assets to be insignificant. d. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Intangible assets that are acquired individually are initially measured at cost or measured at fair value if acquired as part of a business combination. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized straight-line over their estimated remaining useful life, based on their remaining carrying value. Amortization expense is included in cost of sales and general and administrative expense. Finite intangible assets include purchase and sales contracts and other, customer relationships and certain software costs. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. Goodwill is not amortized. e. Leases A specific asset is the subject of a lease if a contract conveys the right to control the use of that identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This determination is made at inception of a contract, on the acquisition date if acquired as part of a business combination, or when the terms and conditions of the contract are amended. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Pembina allocates contract consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on the components' relative stand-alone prices. The consideration allocated to the lease components is recognized in accordance with the policies for lessee and lessor leases, as described below. The consideration allocated to non-lease components is recognized in accordance with the nature of the non-lease component. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 93

Page 95
i) Lessee The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using the rate Pembina would be required to pay to borrow over a similar term with a similar security to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset, or using the interest rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable. Lease payments used in the calculation of the lease liability exclude variable payments unless those payments are in-substance fixed. Lease payments in an optional renewal period are included in the lease liability if Pembina is reasonably certain to exercise such an option. Management applies its best estimate with respect to the likelihood of exercising renewal, extension and termination options in determining the lease term. The lease liability is subsequently increased by interest expense and decreased by lease payments made. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a previously-variable payment becoming in-substance fixed, or a change in the assessment of whether a purchase option, extension option or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised. A corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset when a liability is remeasured, or the adjustment is recorded in earnings if the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. Right-of-use assets are initially recognized at an amount equal to the lease liability, then subsequently depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis and adjusted for any lease liability remeasurements. The right-of-use assets are included in the respective CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing. Pembina has elected to apply the recognition exemptions for short-term and low value leases. Pembina recognizes lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ii) Lessor Lessor leases are classified as either operating leases or finance leases according to the substance of the contract at contract inception. Leases transferring substantially all of the risks incidental to asset ownership are classified as finance leases, while all other leases are classified as operating leases. Subleases are classified as either operating or finance leases in reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. Finance lease receivables acquired in a business combination are initially recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying leased assets. Finance lease receivables outside of a business combination are initially measured at the net present value of the future lease payments and the unguaranteed residual values of the underlying assets, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Finance lease income is subsequently recognized using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Operational finance lease income generated from physical assets in the normal course of operations is recorded as a component of revenue. Lease payments received for finance leases include both the finance income and a principal repayment of the finance lease receivable. Payments related to the principal repayment are not recognized in earnings and are classified as investing cashflows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Lease payments from operating leases are recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis and are fully recognized in earnings and operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Variable lease income represents lease payments that were uncertain and are excluded from measurement of the operating or finance lease and are comprised of non-minimum charges based on customer-usage or on flow-through costs incurred by Pembina in operating the leased assets. Variable lease income is recognized in the period the uncertainty is resolved. When the timing of lease income differs from when Pembina is entitled to the associated lease payment, a receivable or a deferred lease liability is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 94 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

f. Impairment i) Non-Derivative Financial Assets Impairment of financial assets carried at amortized cost is assessed using the lifetime expected credit loss of the financial asset at initial recognition and throughout the life of the financial asset. However, if credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition, impairment is assessed at the 12-month expected credit loss of the financial asset at the reporting date. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings and reflected as a reduction in the related financial asset. ii) Non-Financial Assets Non-financial assets, other than inventory, assets arising from employee benefits, and deferred tax assets, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if an impairment indicator exists. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into CGUs. CGUs are the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from the continued use of the related assets, and are largely independent from other assets. CGUs may incorporate integrated assets from multiple operating segments, which reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for management purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. In determining CGUs, significant management judgment is required to assess what constitutes independent cash flows. When an impairment test is performed, the carrying value of a CGU or group of CGUs is compared to its recoverable amount. As such, the asset composition of a CGU or group of CGUs directly impacts both the carrying value and recoverability of the assets included therein. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset, CGU or group of CGUs exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. The estimated recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal, by using either the income (cash flow) approach or comparable market transactions, if available. When using the income approach, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions concerning future cash flows, which are impacted by energy transition considerations, access to global markets, and business contracting assumptions. In addition, when determining the appropriate discount rate, management is required to make assumptions concerning the current industry and economic environment, as well as asset and cash-flow specific risk premiums. These estimates and assumptions are susceptible to change and may differ from actual future developments. This estimation uncertainty could impact quantified recoverable amounts; and therefore, any related impairment charges, which may be material. Impairment losses are recognized in earnings. Impairment losses recognized in respect of a CGU (group of CGUs) are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. For non-financial assets, excluding goodwill, impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. An impairment reversal is recognized in earnings under impairment (reversal) expense. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 95

Page 97
Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an equity accounted investee is not recognized separately; and therefore, is not tested for impairment separately. Rather, the investment, including its respective goodwill, is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence it may be impaired as a result of one or more events having occurred that could negatively impact the estimated future cash flows from the investment. If the investment does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other Pembina assets, its carrying value is added to a CGU to which the investment relates. g. Employee Benefits i) Defined Benefit Pension Plans Pembina's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted to determine its present value, less the fair value of any plan assets. The discount rate used to determine the present value is established by referencing market yields on high-quality corporate bonds on the measurement date with cash flows that match the timing and amount of expected benefits. The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed each reporting period; however, the calculation of the actuarial funding valuation is performed, at a minimum, every three years by a qualified actuary using the actuarial cost method. The actuarial valuation is prepared using management's best estimates with respect to longevity, discount and inflation rates, compensation increases, market returns on plan assets, retirement and termination rates. When the calculation results in a benefit to Pembina, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of future expenses payable from the plan, any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Pembina recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income and expenses related to defined benefit plans in earnings. ii) Share-Based Payment Transactions For equity settled share-based payment plans ("options"), the fair value of the share-based payment at grant date is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service conditions at the vesting date. The fair value of options are measured using the Black-Scholes formula on grant date. Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the option, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the option (based on historical experience and general option holder behavior), expected dividends, expected forfeitures and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. The fair value of the long-term share unit award incentive plan and associated distribution units are measured based on the volume-weighted average price of Pembina's shares for the 20 days ending of the relevant financial year. For cash settled share-based payment plans, the fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date. The fair value is determined by using a model that takes into account the extent to which the employees have rendered services or performance conditions to date, share price volatility assumptions, and other market conditions which may impact the number of awards expected to be earned and vest. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as an expense in earnings. 96 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 98
h. Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, Pembina has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation. With regards to these potential obligations, Pembina considers environmental laws, regulations and interpretations by regulatory authorities in determining expected cash flows. Provisions are measured at each reporting date based on the best estimate of the settlement amount. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount rate is recognized as accretion in finance costs. i) Decommissioning Provision Pembina's activities give rise to certain dismantling, decommissioning, environmental reclamation, and remediation obligations at the end of an asset's economic life. Decommissioning costs are recognized as part of the cost of the relevant asset. The unwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and recognized in net finance costs. To measure the decommissioning provision, estimated future expected cash flows, including assumptions concerning inflation and anticipated changes in environmental laws and regulations, are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Changes in the estimated future expected cash flows used in measuring the decommissioning provision are added to or deducted from the cost of the respective asset to which the decommissioning provision relates. i. Insurance contracts Pembina may issue parental guarantees and or letters of credit on behalf of the Company's joint ventures. Under the contracts, Pembina will reimburse the third party beneficiary of the contract in the event that the Company's joint ventures are unable to pay their obligations when due, and as a result are classified as insurance contracts. Pembina does not receive premiums from the counterparties for providing the insurance contract, and as a result the contracts are considered onerous. During 2023 and 2024, insurance contracts were issued on behalf of the Company's joint venture, Cedar LNG, however at as December 31, 2024, all of these contracts had been extinguished. On initial recognition or when an insurance contract is modified, Pembina recognizes its share of the cost of providing the contract on behalf of the joint venture as an in-substance contribution to the joint venture. All other changes to the insurance liability are recognized in earnings. Pembina applies judgments to determine the future probability and expected cashflows related to its insurance contracts. During 2023 and 2024, these judgments included assessing different scenarios for the likelihood that the Cedar LNG project would reach a positive final investment decision ("FID") and assessing the potential cash outflows that Pembina would have been required to make under the different scenarios. A risk adjustment was then applied to the probability weighted cash outflows for the non-financial risks inherent in the scenarios, and a credit-adjusted discount rate was used to incorporate the financial risks of non-performance. Following positive FID, Cedar replaced the Pembina guarantees and letters of credit with Cedar's own security, Pembina's insurance contract obligations were extinguished, and a corresponding recovery was recognized in net finance costs. j. Revenue Pembina recognizes revenue equal to the consideration that it is entitled to for satisfying a performance obligation to a customer. Performance obligations in Pembina's contracts with customers include: • promises to perform transportation, gas processing, fractionation, terminalling, and storage services over a specified contractual term and/or for a specified volume of commodities; and • promises to transfer control of commodities to the customer at a specified time periods and locations. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 97

Page 99
Certain contracts may arise that require Pembina to apply significant judgment when identifying the contract's performance obligations where (i) Pembina is providing both services and commodities; (ii) Pembina is providing services and purchasing commodities from the same counterparty; or (iii) Pembina is both purchasing and selling commodities from the same counterparty. In contracts where Pembina performs service-type activities to enhance the value of a product and is either purchasing or selling the product, identification of the performance obligations in the contract will depend on whether Pembina or the customer has control of the product when Pembina performs the service activity. If Pembina controls a product while performing the service activity that enhances the product, the service activity is for Pembina’s benefit and is not considered a performance obligation. As a result, any fees that Pembina receives from a supplier for performing a service for Pembina’s benefit are treated as a reduction in the purchase price of the product rather than as revenue, or in the case of a product sales contract, any fees related to performing the service are allocated to the product sales revenue rather than separately recognizing service revenues. Other situations may have Pembina purchasing and subsequently selling a product without ever obtaining control of that product or selling and then subsequently repurchasing a product without ever losing control of the product. In these cases, Management will determine whether the substance of the arrangement is to provide a service to a customer where the net proceeds will be recognized as service revenue, or to receive a service where the net proceeds will be recognized as a cost outside of revenue. Pembina disaggregates its revenue streams from contacts with customers into three categories based on the nature of the revenue generating activity and the certainty of the associated cashflows to be received from the customer. Information about the nature of the services provided, consideration received, and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations for each category is discussed below. i) Take-or-Pay Transportation, processing, and other services Pembina provides transportation, gas processing, fractionation, terminalling, and storage services under take-or-pay contracts. In a take-or-pay contract, Pembina is entitled to a minimum fee for the firm service promised to a customer over the contract period, regardless of actual volumes transported, processed, terminalled, or stored. This minimum fee is either a set fee for an annual minimum volume, or an annual minimum revenue requirement. In addition, the minimum fee may include variable consideration for operating or capital costs incurred by Pembina that are recovered from the customer. Estimating the variable consideration to be recognized involves judgment, particularly in assessing the risk of a significant revenue reversal. For contracts where management has identified multiple performance obligations, management estimates the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation taking into consideration the location and volume of goods and services being provided, the market environment, and customer specific considerations. Pembina satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue for services under take-or-pay commitments when volumes are transported, processed, terminalled, stored, or capacity utilized. Make-up rights may arise when a customer does not fulfill their minimum volume commitment in a certain period but is allowed to use the delivery of past or future volumes to meet this commitment. These make-up rights are subject to expiry and have varying conditions associated with them. When contract terms allow a customer to exercise their make-up rights using firm volume commitments, revenue is not recognized until these make-up rights are used, expire, or management determines breakage has occurred. If Pembina bills a customer for unused service in an earlier period and the customer utilizes available make-up rights, Pembina records a refund liability for the amount to be returned to the customer through an annual adjustment process. For contracts where no make- up rights exist, revenue is recognized to take-or-pay levels once Pembina has an enforceable right to payment for the take-or- pay volumes. Make-up rights generally expire within a contract year and substantially all the related contract years follow the calendar year. 98 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 100
As a result of deferring revenue related to customer underutilization until the earlier of when the customer uses the volumes or the customers' make-up rights expire, a portion of cashflows received from the customer in early quarters of the year is deferred and not recognized in revenue until later quarters, although there is no impact on cash flows received from the customers. When up-front payments or non-cash consideration is received in exchange for future services to be performed, revenue is deferred as a contract liability and recognized over the period the performance obligation is expected to be satisfied. Non- cash consideration is measured at fair value when received. Operating services When a contract has the effect of providing the customer with a lease over a Pembina-owned processing, transportation, or storage asset, Pembina remains responsible for operating and maintaining the asset over the contract term. Pembina’s promise to provide a service of operating a leased asset is a stand-ready performance obligation. Fixed fees earned for operating services are recognized evenly over the contract term and variable flow-through fees, including capital maintenance and turnaround charges, are recognized in the period the services are performed. When the timing of payments received in exchange for the services performed differs from when the work is performed and the revenue recognized, a contract asset or liability is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. ii) Fee-for-Service Fee-for-service revenue includes firm contracted revenue that is not subject to take-or-pay commitments and interruptible service. Pembina satisfies its performance obligations for transportation, gas processing, fractionation, terminalling, and storage as volumes of product are transported, processed, fractionated, terminalled, or stored. Revenue is based on a contracted fee and consideration is variable with respect to volumes. Payment is generally due in the month following Pembina's provision of service and revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied. iii) Product Sales Pembina's performance obligation in a product sale is to transfer control of a distinct product or products to the customer. Pembina satisfies its performance obligation on product sales and recognizes the associated revenue when the customer obtains control of the product, which may differ from when legal title or physical custody transfers. The determination of control requires judgments in determining who has the rights to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining economic benefits from the specified product. Such judgments consider the specific nature and purposes of the product in relation to Pembina's operations and business model, the location and point of sale, and what purpose the product serves for the customer. Product sale contracts that are concluded to be derivative instruments and that settle by physical delivery of the underlying commodity are not accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers. Rather, such derivative instruments are recorded on a net basis in revenue as 'Revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts'. k. Income Tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in earnings except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items that are recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for: • Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and, • Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 99

Page 101
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which Pembina expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to offset, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either: i) the same taxable entity; or ii) different taxable entities where the intent is to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or where tax liabilities and assets will be realized simultaneously in each future period. The calculation of the deferred tax asset or liability is based on assumptions about the timing of many taxable events and the enacted or substantively enacted rates anticipated to be applicable to income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be realized or reversed. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the deductible temporary differences will be recoverable in future periods and estimates and judgment are used in assessing the recognition. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Estimates including, but not limited to, the timing of reversal and future taxability may differ on actual realization and may result in an income tax charge or credit in future periods. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, Pembina considers income tax exposures and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes Pembina to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. As provided in the amendments to IAS 12, Pembina applies the mandatory exception to recognize and disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The mandatory exception has been applied retrospectively with no material impact to Pembina's Consolidated Financial Statements. l. Segment Reporting An operating segment is a component of Pembina that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Company's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by Pembina's President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and other Senior Vice Presidents ("SVPs") to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. Segment results that are reported to the CEO, CFO and other SVPs include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. m. New Standards and Interpretations Adopted in the Current Year i) Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants The Company adopted Amendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants effective January 1, 2024. The amendments did not have an impact on Pembina other than additional disclosure related to debt covenants (refer to Note 15 Long-Term Debt – Covenants for further information). n. New Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Adopted Pembina continually monitors for new accounting standards and amendments to existing accounting standards issued by the IASB. The new standards or amendments are not expected to have a material impact to Pembina’s financial statements except for the items outlined below. 100 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Page 102
i) IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements ("IFRS 18") IFRS 18 was issued in April 2024 and effective January 1, 2027, with early application permitted. The standard introduces key changes to the structure of the statement of earnings and comprehensive income, required disclosures for certain management-defined performance measures, and aggregation and disaggregation of line items in the financial statements. Pembina is currently reviewing the impact of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. ii) Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 - Contracts referencing Nature-dependent Electricity ("Contracts referencing NDE") Contracts referencing NDE was issued in December 2024 and effective January 1, 2026, with early adoption permitted. The amendments provide relief as it relates to accounting for contracts to purchase or sell electricity from nature-dependent sources such as wind and solar power, including clarifying the application of own-use requirements, permitting hedge accounting if these contracts are used as hedging instruments, and adding new disclosure to enable investors to understand the effect of these contracts to Pembina. Pembina is currently reviewing the impact of this amendment as it relates to Pembina's wind-based power purchase agreements. 4. VOLUNTARY CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES Physical derivative instruments include purchases and sales of commodities (crude, natural gas liquids, natural gas, and others), which are physically settled by receipt or delivery of the commodity. Unrealized gains and losses and the settlement of physical derivative instruments, including any realized gains and losses, have historically been recorded as revenue from contracts with customers and cost of sales for sales and purchases, respectively. Commodity-related financial derivative instruments include purchases and sales of commodities executed for risk management purposes that are net settled in cash, with no receipt or delivery of the underlying commodity. Unrealized gains and losses and the settlement of commodity-related financial 'sale' and 'purchase' derivative instruments, including any realized gains and losses, have historically been recorded net as 'Loss (gain) on commodity-related derivative financial instruments', which was previously presented separately from the Company's revenue-generating activities. Foreign exchange and interest rate risk management activities give rise to financial derivative contracts. Unrealized gains and losses for instruments that did not apply hedge accounting and the settlement of other financial derivative instruments, including any realized gains and losses, have historically been recorded as 'Net finance costs'. Consequently, all other non- commodity related financial derivative contracts have been recorded and presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. With respect to the related accounting policies above, Pembina has made the following voluntary changes retrospectively: (a) all unrealized and realized gains and losses and the settlement of physical derivative instruments and commodity-related financial derivative instruments recorded at fair value (purchases and sales) will be recorded on a net basis in revenue as 'Revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts'; and (b) all unrealized and realized gains and losses and the settlement of foreign exchange-related financial derivative instruments that are executed to economically hedge foreign exchange risk on commodity-related contracts will be recorded on a net basis in revenue as 'Revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts'. These voluntary changes in accounting policies were made for the following reasons in aid of providing more reliable and relevant information: (a) to better align the related financial reporting with the Company's business model; (b) to provide a more suitable illustration of the Company's use of derivative instruments for the purpose of asset optimization, risk management, and servicing customer needs; and (c) to improve consistency with peer and industry financial reporting and practices.

5. ACQUISITION On April 1, 2024, Pembina completed the acquisition of Enbridge Inc.'s ("Enbridge") interests in the Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen joint ventures (the "Acquirees") for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion, net of $327 million of assumed debt, representing Enbridge's proportionate share of the indebtedness of Alliance (the "Acquisition"). As a result of the Acquisition, Pembina obtained control over the Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen joint ventures (the "Acquirees") and, as such, the accounting for the results of the Acquirees following completion of the Acquisition changed from the equity method of accounting to being fully consolidated and incorporated into Pembina's financial results. Pembina's completion of the Acquisition resulted in an in-substance disposition at fair value of $2.6 billion for the Company's previous investments, which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting at $2.8 billion, as well as allocated goodwill of $380 million, resulting in a loss on disposition of $616 million. The loss was offset by a deferred tax recovery of $626 million. The loss on disposition and the deferred tax recovery were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the period ended December 31, 2024. The fair value of the previously held equity investment in the Acquirees is included as a component of the purchase price. Following the Acquisition, Pembina owned all equity interests in Alliance, Aux Sable's Canadian operations and NRGreen businesses, and an 85.4 percent interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations. Alliance and NRGreen are fully consolidated into the financial results of the Pipelines Division, while Aux Sable is reported within the Facilities Division and Marketing & New Ventures Division. These assets complement Pembina's strategy of providing access to long-life resources from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin to premium end markets and increases exposure to lighter hydrocarbons, including natural gas and NGL. The Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method where the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, with the exception of right-of-use assets, deferred tax liabilities, and lease liabilities, which are measured in accordance with Pembina's accounting policies. Pembina elected to take the accounting policy choice to measure the non-controlling interest at the proportionate value of Aux Sable's U.S. operations' net assets. The purchase price equation, subject to finalization, is based on assessed fair values and is as follows: As at April 1, 2024 Previously reported Adjustments Updated ($ millions) in Q2 2024 Purchase Price Consideration Cash (net of cash acquired) 2,620 — 2,620 Equity investment in Acquirees 2,562 — 2,562 Other 12 — 12 5,194 — 5,194 Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired Current assets 240 — 240 Property, plant and equipment 6,339 6 6,345 Other long-term assets 38 19 57 Goodwill 805 (2) 803 Current liabilities (219) (17) (236) Long-term debt (596) — (596) Deferred tax liabilities (937) 1 (936) Provisions (52) — (52) Other long-term liabilities (276) (7) (283) Non-controlling interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations (148) — (148) 5,194 — 5,194 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 103

Page 105
Pembina engaged an independent valuator to assist with determining the fair value of Pembina's previously held equity investments in the Acquirees, as well as certain tangible and intangible assets within the purchase price equation. The fair value of Pembina's previous equity investment in the Acquirees was determined based on the negotiated purchase price paid to Enbridge, adjusted for identified control synergies measured using a discounted cash flow model. The resulting control premium implied by the control synergies was compared to comparable market transactions. The control synergies include significant estimates for timing, amount, and likelihood. Changes to the estimates of the timing, amount and likelihood of the control synergies could impact the fair value of the previously held equity investments and therefore the loss on disposition. In addition, the fair value of the previously held equity investments is included as a component of the purchase price. Changes to the estimates of the timing, amount and likelihood of the control synergies could impact the measurement of property, plant and equipment, other assets, deferred tax liabilities and non-controlling interest. Property, plant and equipment assets of $6.3 billion were valued primarily using a cost approach, which includes the determination of the replacement cost for a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a comparable asset, adjusted for external conditions, including physical, functional and economic obsolescence. Goodwill of $803 million recognized on the transaction is a result of deferred taxes recognized on the transaction, which are recorded at the Company's effective tax rate without discounting. Pembina recognized $24 million in acquisition-related expenses. All acquisition-related expenses have been expensed as incurred and are included in other expenses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The purchase price allocation is not final, as Pembina continues to obtain and verify information required to determine the acquisition date value of deferred income taxes. During the third and fourth quarters of 2024, Pembina adjusted the preliminary fair value of the identifiable net assets to reflect updated information. This included an increase in the value of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, an increase in the value of litigation liabilities, as well as a decrease in the value of long-term contract liabilities, with a corresponding increase in the value of accounts payable. These changes resulted in an increase in the fair value of the property, plant, and equipment and an increase in the value of the deferred tax liabilities, with a corresponding increase in the value of goodwill. Any further adjustments to the purchase price allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Revenue generated by the acquisition for the period from the acquisition date of April 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 was $1.3 billion. Earnings for the same period were $493 million. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2024, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have increased by an additional $524 million and consolidated earnings for the period would have increased by an additional $74 million. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2024. On August 1, 2024, Pembina acquired the remaining 14.6 percent interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations from certain subsidiaries of The Williams Companies for U.S. $160 million. Pembina's subsequent acquisition of the non-controlling interest was recorded directly in equity. 104 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

6. OPERATING SEGMENTS Pembina determines its reportable segments based on the nature of operations and includes three operating segments: Pipelines, Facilities and Marketing & New Ventures. The Pipelines segment includes conventional, oil sands and transmission pipeline systems, crude oil storage and terminalling business and related infrastructure serving various markets and basins across North America. The Facilities segment includes processing and fractionation facilities and related infrastructure, and a liquefied propane export facility on Canada's West Coast. In addition, all NGL transported along the Alliance Pipeline are extracted through the Pembina operated Channahon Facility at the terminus. These facilities provide Pembina's customers with natural gas and NGL services that are fully accessible to Pembina's other strategically located assets and pipeline systems. The Facilities segment also includes a bulk marine terminal in the Port of Vancouver, Canada. The Marketing & New Ventures segment undertakes value-added commodity marketing activities including buying and selling products and optimizing storage opportunities, by contracting capacity on Pembina's and various third-party pipelines and utilizing Pembina's rail fleet and rail logistics capabilities. Marketing activities also include identifying commercial opportunities to further develop other Pembina assets. Pembina's Marketing business also includes sales of products from Aux Sable's NGL extraction facility near Chicago, Illinois and other natural gas and NGL processing facilities, logistics and distribution assets in the United States and Canada. The financial results of the operating segments are included below. Performance is measured based on results from operating activities, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by Pembina's CEO, CFO and other SVPs. These results are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment transactions are recorded at market value and eliminated under corporate and inter-segment eliminations.

Depreciation Pipeline assets, facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method with remaining useful life of one to 75 years with the majority of assets depreciated over 40 years. Cavern storage and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over ten to 40 years with the majority of assets depreciated over 40 years. These rates are established to depreciate remaining net book value over the shorter of their useful lives or economic lives. 10.

Goodwill Impairment Testing For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Pembina's operating segments which represent the groups of CGUs at which goodwill is monitored for management purposes. Annually, impairment testing for goodwill is performed in the fourth quarter. The goodwill test was performed and no impairment was identified as it was determined that the recoverable amount for each operating segment exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill. The recoverable amount was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal approach by discounting each operating segment's expected future cash flows (Level 3). The key assumptions that impact the recoverable amount include the following: • Cash flows for the first five years are projected based on past experience, actual operating results and the business plan approved by management. Cash flows for Pipelines and Facilities incorporate assumptions regarding contracted volumes and rates, which are based on market expectations. In addition, revenue and cost of product projections for Marketing & New Ventures incorporate assumptions regarding commodity volumes and pricing, which are sensitive to changes in the commodity price environment. • Cash flows for the remaining years of the useful lives of the assets within each operating segment are extrapolated for periods up to 75 years (2023: 60 years) using a long-term growth rate, except where contracted, long-term cash flows indicate that no growth rate should be applied or a specific reduction in cash flows is more appropriate. • After-tax discount rates are applied in determining the recoverable amount of operating segments. Discount rates are estimated based on the risk free rate and average cost of debt, targeted debt to equity ratio, in addition to estimates of the specific operating segment's equity risk premium, size premium, projection risk, asset risk, and betas. For each operating segment, key assumptions and discount rate sensitivity are presented below: Operating Segments As at December 31, 2024 Pipelines Facilities Marketing & New Ventures Key assumptions used Average annual pre-tax cash flow ($ millions) 2,170 1,790 719 After-tax discount rate (percent) 6.1 6.0 8.0 Long-term growth rate (percent) 1.6 1.8 2.3 Incremental change in rates that would result in carrying value equal to recoverable amount Increase in after-tax discount rate (percent) 3.4 2.8 15.4 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 109

Financing Activities for Equity Accounted Investees Cedar LNG On June 25, 2024, Pembina and its partner, the Haisla Nation, announced a positive Final Investment Decision ("FID") on the Cedar LNG Project (the "Project"), a floating liquefied natural gas facility to be located in Kitimat, British Columbia. Cedar LNG expects to use asset-level funding to finance approximately 60 percent of the Project's costs with the remaining 40 percent of the Project's costs expected to be financed through equity contributions from both partners. In advance of the positive FID, various financing arrangements were established between Pembina, the Haisla Nation, and Cedar LNG, to ensure the joint venture had sufficient and adequate cash-flow for all necessary pre-FID activities. As a result of the positive FID, various provisions within these financing arrangements were triggered, whereby Pembina became entitled to either (a) returns of pre-FID contributions; or (b) principal and interest relating to lending arrangements that had been established. During the first six months of 2024, Pembina made total pre-FID cash payments of $446 million to Cedar LNG, with $241 million as Pembina's equity contributions and $205 million recognized as a loan receivable from its partner. Following the positive FID, Pembina received full repayment of the loan receivable including accrued interest. In addition, Pembina received $63 million in equity distributions from Cedar LNG as a return of pre-FID capital that had been provided on behalf of its partner or in support of other pre-FID commitments. On FID, Pembina also recognized a liability for amounts previously recorded as a provision for contingent consideration on acquisition of Cedar LNG in 2021. Prior to the positive FID, various letters of credit of $102 million and other parental guarantees were issued by Pembina on behalf of Cedar LNG, which had given rise to an insurance contract liability on Pembina's financial statements. Following the positive FID, the required financial assurances were assumed by Cedar LNG and as a result, Pembina recorded a gain of $34 million upon the derecognition of the related insurance contract liability in the second quarter of 2024. Cedar LNG secured a letter of credit facility whereby future financial assurances will be provided directly by Cedar LNG. In connection with the positive FID, Cedar LNG entered into project financing including a U.S. $2.7 billion senior secured construction/term loan facility ("Cedar Term Loan") and a $2.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility ("Cedar Revolving Facility"). The borrowings on the Cedar Term Loan will be used to finance approximately 60 percent of the Cedar LNG Project's costs. The Cedar Revolving Facility will be utilized to provide various letters of credit in support of the Project, including replacing the financial assurances previously issued by Pembina on behalf of Cedar LNG. Further, during the third quarter of 2024, Cedar LNG also entered into a series of economic interest rate hedges. These hedges, at a weighted average effective rate of 3.84 percent, fix a minimum of 75 percent of Cedar LNG's senior secured debt instruments. The floating debt is priced at USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). PGI In 2024, PGI leveraged its existing credit facilities to finance the previously announced acquisition of midstream assets from Whitecap Resources Inc. and Veren Inc. Summarized Financial Information Financial information for Pembina's equity accounted investees is presented (at 100 percent) in the following tables and is prepared under the financial reporting framework adopted by each equity accounted investee (IFRS except for Alliance, Aux Sable, and Grand Valley which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP). Differences between the equity accounted investee's earnings (loss) and earnings attributable to Pembina relate to the different accounting standards applied and amortization of the excess of the purchase price over the underlying net book value of the investee's assets and liabilities at the purchase date.

PGI Goodwill Impairment Testing At each reporting date, Pembina determines whether there is objective evidence that its equity accounted investments are impaired. For the period ended December 31, 2024, it was determined that there is no objective evidence indicating that Pembina's equity accounted investments are impaired. Pembina's assessment of whether there is objective evidence the equity accounted investment in PGI is impaired requires significant judgment as it is sensitive to a decrease in PGI's projected cash flows, a decrease in the long-term growth rate, or an increase in the after-tax discount rate; any of which could be objective evidence that Pembina's equity accounted investment in PGI is impaired. Pembina also believes an impairment loss recognized by PGI as a result of its annual goodwill impairment test would provide objective evidence that Pembina's equity accounted investment in PGI is impaired. PGI performed its annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2024 calculating the recoverable amount based on the fair value less cost to sell. No impairment loss was recognized. There is measurement uncertainty associated with PGI's annual impairment test. The key assumptions used by PGI that impact the recoverable amount were the projected cash flows for the remaining useful life of the assets, the after-tax discount rate and the long-term growth rate. The following table provides sensitivities to reasonably possible changes in each estimate that could result in an impairment of PGI's goodwill. Actual Change required for impairment (percent) Key assumptions used Average annual pre-tax cash flow ($ millions) (1) 1,232 6.0 After-tax discount rate (percent) 7.6 0.6 Long-term growth rate (percent) 1.4 0.7 (1) Average annual forecasted pre-tax cash flows represent 100 percent of PGI's forecasted cash flows.

The decrease in the effective tax rate from 18.9 percent to (9.0) percent is primarily due to the deferred tax liability derecognition as a result of the Acquisition. Under Pillar Two legislation, Pembina is liable to pay a top-up tax for differences between the Company's Global Anti-Base Erosion effective tax rate and the 15.0 percent minimum tax rate. For jurisdictions where Pembina operates that have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, it was determined that there is no material impact to the Company. Pembina also operates in jurisdictions where Pillar Two regime has not been adopted. For these jurisdictions, Pembina has assessed the exposure to the Pillar Two legislation and foresees no material impact to the Company. The excessive interest and financing expenses limitation regime has been enacted in Canada as of June 20, 2024. Pembina has assessed this limitation and determined that there are no material impacts to the Company as a result of this legislation. Income Tax Expense For the years ended December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Current tax expense 261 325 Deferred tax (recovery) expense Origination and reversal of temporary differences (476) 337 Tax rate changes on deferred tax balances (1) 8 Decrease (Increase) in tax loss carry forward 62 (257) Total deferred tax (recovery) expense (415) 88 Total income tax (recovery) expense (154) 413 Deferred Tax Items Recovered Directly in Equity For the years ended December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Preferred share issue costs (1) — Other comprehensive (loss) income (Note 23) : Change in fair value of net investment hedges 5 2 Remeasurements of defined benefit liability or asset (7) 3 Deferred tax items recovered directly in equity (3) 5 Pembina has temporary differences associated with its investments in subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, Pembina had not recorded a deferred tax asset or liability for these temporary differences (2023: nil) as Pembina controls the timing of the reversal and it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2024, Pembina had U.S. $1.7 billion (2023: U.S. $1.8 billion) of U.S. tax losses that do not expire and $32 million (2023: $40 million) of Canadian tax losses that will expire after 2035. Pembina has determined that it is probable that future taxable profits will be sufficient to utilize these losses. The gross amount of deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset is recognized as at December 31, 2024 is $57 million (2023: $57 million). 13.

Pembina used the remaining net proceeds of the January MTN Offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition. On January 22, 2024, Pembina's $650 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 8, matured and were fully repaid. On April 18, 2024, Pembina completed an extension on its $1.5 billion Revolving Facility, which now matures on June 1, 2029, and an extension on its $50 million operating facility, which now matures on June 1, 2025. On June 28, 2024, Pembina closed an offering of $950 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes (the "June MTN Offering"). The June MTN Offering was conducted in three tranches, consisting of the issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 23 (the "Series 23 notes") having a fixed coupon of 5.22 percent per annum, payable semi-annually and maturing on June 28, 2033; $150 million aggregate principal amount issued through a re-opening of the Series 20 notes; and $150 million aggregate principal amount issued through a re- opening of the Series 22 notes. The net proceeds of the June MTN Offering were used to repay indebtedness of the Company under the Revolving Facility, to fund the partial redemption of the Series 19 notes (as defined below), and for general corporate purposes. On July 6, 2024, Pembina completed the redemption of $150 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured medium-term notes, series 19 (the "Series 19 notes") due June 22, 2026 for cash. The Series 19 notes were redeemed at a redemption price of approximately $1,002 for each $1,000 principal amount of Series 19 notes, being equal to the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest up until, but excluding, July 6, 2024. Pembina funded the redemption of the Series 19 notes through a portion of the net proceeds of the June MTN Offering. On November 17, 2024, Pembina completed the redemption of its remaining outstanding $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Series 19 notes due June 22, 2026, for cash. The Series 19 notes were redeemed at a redemption price of approximately $1,023 for each $1,000 principal amount of Series 19 notes, being equal to the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest up until, but excluding, November 17, 2024. The redemption was funded through a combination of cash on hand and the use of Pembina's credit facility.

16. DECOMMISSIONING PROVISION The decommissioning provision reflects the discounted cash flows expected to be incurred to decommission Pembina's pipeline systems, gas processing and fractionation plants, storage and terminalling hubs, including estimated environmental reclamation and remediation costs. The undiscounted cash flows at the time of decommissioning are calculated using an estimated timing of economic outflows ranging from one to 83 years, with the majority estimated at 50 years. The estimated economic lives of the underlying assets form the basis for determining the timing of economic outflows. Pembina applied credit-adjusted risk-free rates of 4.6 percent to 5.5 percent (2023: 5.0 percent to 5.8 percent) and an inflation rate of 2.3 percent (2023: 2.3 percent).

Share Repurchase Program On May 13, 2024, the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") accepted the renewal of Pembina's normal course issuer bid (the "NCIB") that allowed the Company to repurchase, at its discretion, up to five percent of the Company's outstanding common shares (representing approximately 29 million common shares) through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative Canadian trading systems or as otherwise permitted by applicable securities law, subject to certain restrictions on the number of common shares that may be purchased on a single day. The NCIB commenced on May 16, 2024 and will expire on the earlier of May 15, 2025 and the date on which Pembina has acquired the maximum number of common shares allowable under the NCIB or the date on which Pembina otherwise decides not to make any further repurchases under the NCIB. No common shares were purchased by Pembina during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 1 million common shares were repurchased and cancelled at an average price of $41.76 per share, for a total cost of $50 million. Subscription Receipts In connection with the Acquisition, on December 19, 2023, Pembina closed its offering of 29.9 million subscription receipts (including 3.9 million subscription receipts issued pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters for the offering of the over-allotment option granted to them by Pembina) at a price of $42.85 per subscription receipt for total gross proceeds of $1.3 billion (the "Subscription Receipt Offering"). Pursuant to the terms of the subscription receipts, on March 28, 2024, a payment of $0.6675 per subscription receipt (a "Dividend Equivalent Payment") was made to the holders of subscription receipts of record as of March 15, 2024. The amount of the Dividend Equivalent Payment was equivalent to the dividend paid per common share on the same date to the holders of common shares. After accounting for the Dividend Equivalent Payment, the underwriter fees, other expenses, and interest income related to the Subscription Receipt Offering, net proceeds were $1.2 billion. The net proceeds of the Subscription Receipt Offering were received by Pembina on March 27, 2024 and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition which closed on April 1, 2024. Concurrent with the closing of the Acquisition, each holder of subscription receipts received, automatically and without additional consideration or further action on the part of the holder, one common share of the Company.

The annual dividend rate for the Series 7 Class A Preferred Shares for the five- year period from and including December 1, 2024 to, but excluding, December 1, 2029 will be 5.953 percent. On December 9, 2024, Pembina announced its intention to redeem its issued and outstanding Cumulative Redeemable Floating Rate Class A Preferred Shares, Series 22 ("Series 22 Class A Preferred Shares") for a redemption price equal to $25.50 per Series 22 Class A Preferred Share. Subsequent to the end of the year, on January 8, 2025, Pembina redeemed all of the approximately one million issued and outstanding Series 22 Class A Preferred Shares. Accordingly, Pembina recognized a financial liability of approximately $26 million for the total redemption price of the Series 22 Class A Preferred Shares. 122 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Contract Liabilities Significant changes in the contract liabilities balances during the period are as follows: For the years ended December 31 2024 2023 ($ millions) Take-or-Pay Other Contract Liabilities Total Contract Liabilities Take-or-Pay Other Contract Liabilities Total Contract Liabilities Opening balance 1 158 159 3 191 194 Additions (net in the period) — 49 49 (2) 21 19 Acquisition — 144 144 — — — Revenue recognized from contract liabilities (1) — (44) (44) — (54) (54) Disposition — (10) (10) — — — Closing balance 1 297 298 1 158 159 Less current portion (2) (1) (42) (43) (1) (32) (33) Ending balance — 255 255 — 126 126 (1) Recognition of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied in the period that were included in the opening balance of contract liabilities. (2) Represents cash collected under take-or-pay contracts which will be recognized within one year as the customer chooses to ship, process, or otherwise forego the associated service. Contract liabilities depict Pembina's obligation to perform services in the future for cash and non-cash consideration which have been received from customers. Contract liabilities include up-front payments or non-cash consideration received from customers for future transportation, gas processing, terminalling, and storage services. Contract liabilities also include consideration received from customers for take-or-pay commitments where the customer has a make-up right to ship or process future volumes under a firm contract. These amounts are non-refundable should the customer not use its make-up rights. In all instances where goods or services have been transferred to a customer in advance of the receipt of customer consideration, Pembina's right to consideration is unconditional and has therefore been presented as a receivable.

Page 127
c. Revenue Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations Pembina expects to recognize revenue in future periods that includes current unsatisfied remaining performance obligations totaling $17.9 billion (2023: $11.7 billion). Over the next five years, these remaining performance obligations will be recognized annually ranging from $2.3 billion (2023: $1.7 billion) declining to $1.5 billion (2023: $1.0 billion). Subsequently, up to 2049 (2023: 2047), Pembina will recognize $1.3 billion (2023: $955 million) declining to $563 million (2023: $3 million) per year. In preparing the above figures, Pembina has taken the practical expedient to exclude contracts that have original expected durations of one year or less. Variable consideration relating to flow through costs are not included in the amounts presented. These flow through costs do not impact net income or cash flow, and due to the long-term nature of the contracts there is significant uncertainty in estimating these amounts. In addition, Pembina excludes contracted revenue amounts for assets not yet in-service unless both Board of Directors approval and regulatory approval for the asset has been obtained. 20. NET FINANCE COSTS For the years ended December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost: Loans and borrowings 514 395 Subordinated hybrid notes 29 29 Leases 32 30 Interest income (46) (7) Unwinding of discount rate 20 16 Gain in fair value of non-commodity-related derivative financial instruments — (19) Foreign exchange losses and other 12 22 Net finance costs 561 466 Net interest paid of $528 million (2023: $462 million) includes interest paid during construction and capitalized of $26 million (2023: $15 million). 21. PENSION PLAN As at December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Registered defined benefit net asset (23) (5) Supplemental defined benefit net obligation 15 14 Net employee benefit (assets) obligations (8) 9 Pembina maintains defined contribution plans and non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering its employees. Pembina contributes five to 10 percent of an employee's salary to the defined contribution plan, until the employee's age plus years of service equals 50, at which time they become eligible for the defined benefit plans. Pembina has ended eligibility for new entrants to the defined benefit plan as of January 1, 2021. Pembina recognized $16 million in expense for the defined contribution plan during the year (2023: $14 million). The defined benefit plans include a funded registered plan for all eligible employees and an unfunded supplemental retirement plan for those employees affected by the Canada Revenue Agency maximum pension limits. The defined benefit plans are administered by separate pension funds that are legally separated from Pembina. Benefits under the plans are based on the length of service and the annual average best three years of earnings during the last 10 years of service of the employee. Benefits paid out of the plans are not indexed. Pembina measures its accrued benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for accounting purposes as at December 31 of each year. The most recent actuarial funding valuation was at December 31, 2022. The defined benefit plans expose Pembina to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, and market (investment) risk. 126 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

The funds are invested primarily in equities and bonds. Defined benefit plan contributions totaled $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 (2023: $17 million). Pembina has determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defined benefit plans, and in accordance with statutory requirements of the plans, the present value of refunds or reductions in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the total fair value of the plan assets less the total present value of obligations. As such, no decrease in the defined benefit asset is necessary at December 31, 2024 (2023: nil).

The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the discount rate, compensation increases, retirements and termination rates as set out above. A change in the estimated discount rate of 4.7 percent by 100 basis points at December 31, 2024 is considered reasonably possible in the next financial year. An increase by 100 basis points would result in a $31 million reduction to the obligation whereas, a decrease would lead to a $38 million increase to the obligation. Pembina expects to contribute $20 million to the defined benefit plans in 2025. 22. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS At December 31, 2024, Pembina has the following share-based payment arrangements: Share Option Plan (Equity-Settled) Pembina has a share option plan under which employees are eligible to receive options to purchase shares in Pembina. Long-Term Share Unit Award Incentive Plan (Cash-Settled) Pembina has a long-term share unit award incentive plan. Under the share-based compensation plan, awards of restricted ("RSU") and performance ("PSU") share units are made to officers and employees. The plan results in participants receiving cash compensation based on the value of the underlying notional shares granted under the plan. Payments are based on the trading value of Pembina's common shares plus notional dividends and performance of Pembina. Pembina also has a deferred share unit ("DSU") plan. Under the DSU plan, directors are required to take at least 50 percent of total director compensation as DSUs, until such time that they have met certain share ownership guidelines. A DSU is a notional share that has the same value as one Pembina common share. Its value changes with Pembina's share price. DSUs do not have voting rights but they accrue dividends as additional DSU units, at the same rate as dividends paid on Pembina's common shares. DSUs are paid out when a director retires from the board and are redeemed for cash using the weighted average trading price of common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") for the last five trading days before the redemption date, multiplied by the number of DSUs the director holds. Terms and Conditions of Share Option Plan and Share Unit Award Incentive Plan Share Option Plan Share options vest one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third on the third anniversary of the grant date and have a contractual life of seven years. In 2021, Pembina granted select executive officers and non-officers stock options that vest after a four-year period and expire seven years after issuance.

As of December 31, 2024, the following options are outstanding: (thousands of options, except as noted) Exercise Price (dollars) Options Outstanding at December 31, 2024 Options Exercisable Weighted Average Remaining Life (years) $26.83 – $37.03 563 563 3 $37.04 – $37.50 1,200 — 3 $37.51 – $45.50 973 781 3 $45.51 – $47.71 726 382 4 $47.72 – $50.46 710 546 3 Total 4,172 2,272 3 Options are exercised regularly throughout the year. Therefore, the weighted average share price during the year of $51.47 (2023: $44.68) is representative of the weighted average share price at the date of exercise. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility. The weighted average inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of share options are the following: Share Options Granted For the years ended December 31 (dollars, except as noted) 2024 2023 Weighted average Fair value at grant date 6.96 8.96 Expected volatility (percent) 25.1 35.7 Expected option life (years) 3.67 3.67 Expected annual dividends per option 2.74 2.66 Expected forfeitures (percent) 7.2 7.4 Risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds) (percent) 3.9 3.9 Disclosure of Long-Term Share Unit Award Incentive Plan The long-term share unit award incentive plans were valued using the volume weighted average price for the 20 days ending December 31, 2024 of $54.05 (2023: $45.13). Actual payment may differ from the amount valued based on market price and company performance. 130 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS & RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Management Overview Pembina has exposure to counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk. Pembina recognizes that effective management of these risks is a critical success factor in managing organization and shareholder value. Risk management strategies, policies, and limits ensure risks and exposures are aligned to Pembina's business strategy and risk tolerance. Pembina's Board of Directors is responsible for providing risk management oversight and oversees how management monitors compliance with the organization's risk management policies and procedures. In addition, the Board of Directors reviews the adequacy of this risk framework in relation to the risks faced by Pembina. Internal audit personnel assist the Board of Directors in its oversight role by monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the organization's risk management system. Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty credit risk represents the financial loss Pembina may experience if a counterparty to a financial instrument or commercial agreement fails to meet its contractual obligations to Pembina in accordance with the terms and conditions of such instruments or agreements with Pembina. Counterparty credit risk arises primarily from Pembina's short-term investments, trade and other receivables, advances to related parties and from counterparties to its derivative financial instruments. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 131

Page 133
Pembina manages counterparty credit risk through established credit management techniques. These techniques include conducting comprehensive financial and other assessments for new high exposure counterparties, regular reviews of existing counterparties to monitor a counterparty's creditworthiness, setting exposure limits, monitoring exposures against these limits, entering into master netting arrangements, and obtaining financial assurances where warranted. Pembina utilizes various sources of financial, credit and business information in assessing the creditworthiness of a counterparty. This information includes external credit ratings, where available, and in other cases, detailed financial statement analysis in order to generate an internal credit rating based on quantitative and qualitative factors. The Board of Directors has approved a counterparty exposure limit matrix which establishes the maximum exposure that can be approved for a counterparty based on debt rating. Pembina continues to closely monitor and reassess the creditworthiness of its counterparties, which has resulted in Pembina reducing or mitigating its exposure to certain counterparties where it was deemed warranted and permitted under contractual terms. Financial assurances from counterparties may include guarantees, letters of credit and cash. As at December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $276 million (2023: $124 million) were held primarily in respect of customer trade receivables. Pembina typically has collected its trade receivables in full and at December 31, 2024, 99 percent were current (2023: 98 percent). Management defines current as outstanding accounts receivable under 30 days past due. Pembina has a general lien and a continuing and first priority security interest in, and a secured charge on, all of a shipper's petroleum products in its custody. At December 31, the aging of past due trade and other receivables was as follows: ($ millions) 2024 2023 31-60 days past due 1 2 Greater than 61 days past due 2 3 3 5 Pembina uses a loss allowance matrix to measure lifetime expected credit losses at initial recognition and throughout the life of the receivable. The loss allowance matrix is determined based on Pembina's historical default rates over the expected life of trade receivables, adjusted for forward-looking estimates. Management believes the unimpaired amounts that are past due by greater than 30 days are fully collectible based on historical default rates of customers and management's assessment of counterparty credit risk through established credit management techniques as discussed above. Expected credit losses on trade and other receivables related to leases are determined using a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses, measured as the present value of all expected cash shortfalls, discounted at the interest rates implicit in the leases, using reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. Pembina considers the risk of default relating to lease receivables low based on Pembina's assessment of individual counterparty credit risk through established credit management techniques as discussed above. Pembina monitors and manages its concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis. Pembina believes these measures minimize its counterparty credit risk, but there is no certainty that they will protect it against all material losses. As part of its ongoing operations, Pembina must balance its market and counterparty credit risks when making business decisions. 132 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk Pembina will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due. The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments. Outstanding Balances Due by Period As at December 31, 2024 Carrying Amount Expected Cash Flows Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years ($ millions) Trade payables and other 1,202 1,202 1,202 — — — Loans and borrowings 12,060 18,882 1,994 2,090 2,249 12,549 Subordinated hybrid notes 596 776 29 58 58 631 Derivative financial liabilities 159 159 49 20 16 74 Lease liabilities 665 867 113 201 160 393 Pembina manages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows over a 12-month rolling time period to identify financing requirements. These financing requirements are then addressed through a combination of credit facilities and through access to capital markets, if required. Market Risk Pembina's results are subject to movements in commodity prices, foreign exchange, and interest rates. A formal Risk Management Program, which includes policies and procedures, has been designed to mitigate these risks. a. Commodity Price Risk Certain of the transportation contracts or tolling arrangements with respect to Pembina's pipeline assets do not include take- or-pay commitments from crude oil and natural gas producers and, as a result, Pembina is exposed to volume risk with respect to those assets. A decrease in volumes transported can directly and adversely affect Pembina's revenues and earnings. The demand for, and utilization of, Pembina's pipeline assets may be impacted by factors such as changing market fundamentals, capacity bottlenecks, operational incidents, regulatory restrictions, system maintenance, weather and increased competition. Market fundamentals, such as commodity prices and price differentials, natural gas and gasoline consumption, alternative energy sources and global supply disruptions outside of Pembina's control can impact both the supply of and demand for the commodities transported on Pembina's pipelines, which can, in turn, impact the demand for, and utilization of, Pembina's pipeline assets. Pembina's Marketing business includes activities related to product storage, terminalling, and hub services. These activities expose Pembina to certain risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and, as a result, Pembina may experience volatility in revenue and impairments related to the book value of stored product with respect to these activities. Primarily, Pembina enters into contracts to purchase and sell crude oil, condensate, NGL, power and natural gas at floating market prices. As a result, the prices of products that are marketed by Pembina are subject to volatility due to factors such as seasonal demand changes, extreme weather conditions, market inventory levels, general economic conditions, changes in global markets and other factors. Pembina manages its risk exposure by balancing purchases and sales to secure less volatile margins. Notwithstanding Pembina's management of price and quality risk, marketing margins for commodities can vary and have varied significantly from period to period in the past. This variability could have an adverse effect on the results of Pembina's Marketing business and its overall results of operations. To assist in reducing this inherent variability in its Marketing business, Pembina has invested, and will continue to invest, in assets that have a fee-based revenue component. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 133

Pembina is also exposed to potential price declines and decreasing frac spreads between the time Pembina purchases NGL feedstock and sells NGL products. Frac spread is the difference between the revenue from the sale of NGL if removed from a gas stream and the value such NGL would have had if left in the gas stream and sold at natural gas prices. Frac spreads can change significantly from period to period depending on the relationship between NGL and natural gas prices (the "frac spread ratio"), absolute commodity prices, transport differentials and changes in the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In addition to the frac spread ratio changes, there is also a differential between NGL product prices and crude oil prices which can change margins realized for midstream products. The amount of profit or loss made on the extraction portion of the business will generally increase or decrease with frac spreads. This exposure could result in variability of cash flow generated by the Marketing business. Pembina utilizes financial derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy to assist in managing the exposure to commodity price, interest rate, cost of power, and foreign exchange risk. As an example of commodity price mitigation, Pembina actively fixes a portion of its exposure to frac spread margins through the use of derivative financial instruments. Pembina has also entered into power purchase agreements to secure cost-competitive renewable energy, fix the price for a portion of the power Pembina consumes, and reduce its emissions. Pembina's Marketing business is exposed to variability in quality, time and location differentials for various products, and financial instruments may be used to offset Pembina's exposures to these differentials. The following table shows the impact on earnings if the underlying forward commodity prices of the derivative financial instruments increased or decreased by 15 percent, with other variables held constant. As at December 31, 2024 15 Percent 15 Percent ($ millions) Price Increase Price Decrease Crude oil (1) (12) 12 Natural gas 12 (12) NGL (2) (46) 46 (1) Includes condensate. (2) Includes propane and butane. b. Foreign Exchange Risk Certain of Pembina's cash flows, namely a portion of its commodity-related cash flows, certain cash flows from U.S.-based infrastructure assets and distributions from U.S.-based investments in equity accounted investees, are subject to currency risk, arising from the denomination of specific cash flows in U.S. dollars. Additionally, a portion of Pembina's capital expenditures and contributions or loans to Pembina's U.S.-based investments in equity accounted investees, may be denominated in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, the value of the investment in U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates when translated into Pembina's functional currency. Pembina monitors, assesses and responds to these foreign currency risks using an active risk management program, which may include the issuance of U.S. dollar debt, and exchange of foreign currency for domestic currency at a fixed rate. The following table shows the impact on earnings (1) if the underlying foreign exchange risk rate of the derivative financial instruments increased or decreased by $0.10, with other variables held constant. As at December 31, 2024 $0.10 $0.10 ($ millions) Rate Increase Rate Decrease U.S. to Canadian dollars (22) 22 (1) Based on the U.S. to Canadian dollar exchange rate. c. Interest Rate Risk Interest bearing financial liabilities include Pembina's debt and lease liabilities. Pembina has floating interest rate debt in the form of its Credit Facilities, which subjects Pembina to interest rate risk. Pembina monitors and assesses variable interest rate risk and responds to this risk by issuing long-term debt with fixed interest rates or by entering into interest rate swaps. 134 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Pembina's U.S. drawings on its Credit Facilities and Pembina's interest rate swaps have variable rate components that reference the U.S. SOFR. Pembina's Canadian dollar drawings on its Credit Facilities have variable rate components that reference the CORRA. At the reporting date, the interest rate profile of Pembina's interest-bearing financial instruments was: As at December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Carrying amounts of financial liability Fixed rate instruments (1) 12,173 10,365 Variable rate instruments (2) 1,148 778 13,321 11,143 (1) Includes lease liabilities and subordinated hybrid notes. (2) Includes financial derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments, fixing the interest rates on U.S. $250 million of variable rate debt as at December 31, 2024 (2023: U.S. $250 million). Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Variable Rate Instruments The following table shows the impact on earnings if interest rates at the reporting date would have increased or decreased by 100 basis points, with other variables held constant. As at December 31, 2024 100 Basis Point 100 Basis Point ($ millions) Increase Decrease Variable rate instruments (8) 8 Fair Values The fair value of financial instruments utilizes a variety of valuation inputs. When measuring fair value, Pembina uses observable market data to the greatest extent possible. Depending on the nature of these valuation inputs, financial instruments are categorized as follows: a. Level 1 Level 1 fair values are based on inputs that are unadjusted observable quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities as at the measurement date. b. Level 2 Level 2 fair values are based on inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable. Level 2 fair value inputs include quoted forward market prices, time value, and broker quotes that are observable for the duration of the financial instrument's contractual term. These inputs are often adjusted for factors specific to the asset or liability, such as, location differentials and credit risk. Financial instruments that utilize Level 2 fair valuation inputs, include derivatives arising from physical commodity forward contracts, commodity swaps and options, and forward interest rate and foreign-exchange swaps. In addition, Pembina's loans and borrowings utilize Level 2 fair valuation inputs, whereby the valuation technique is based on discounted future interest and principal payments using the current market interest rates of instruments with similar terms. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 135

Page 137
c. Level 3 Level 3 fair values utilize inputs that are not based on observable market data. Rather, various valuation techniques are used to develop inputs. Financial instruments that utilize Level 3 fair valuation inputs include embedded derivative instruments arising from long-term power purchase agreements. The fair value of long-term power purchase agreements is measured using a pricing and cash flow model that accounts for forward power prices, renewable wind power pricing discounts and differentials, and inflationary metrics. The rate used to discount the respective estimated cash flows is a government risk-free interest rate that is adjusted for an appropriate credit spread. The fair valuation of the embedded derivative instruments is judged to be a significant management estimate. These assumptions and inputs are susceptible to change and may differ from actual future developments. This estimation uncertainty could materially impact the quantified fair value; and therefore, the gains and losses on commodity-related derivative financial instruments. As at December 31, 2024, a ten percent increase or decrease of wind power pricing discounts and forward power prices would increase or decrease earnings by $53 million (2023: $80 million) due to the resulting unrealized mark-to-market adjustment. The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities in relation to their respective fair values, together with their appropriate fair value categorization are illustrated in the table below. Certain other non-derivative financial instruments measured at amortized cost, including cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other, trade payables and other, and other liabilities have been excluded since their carrying values are judged to approximate their fair values due to their nature and short maturity. These instruments would be categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 2024 2023 As at December 31 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value ($ millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets carried at fair value Derivative financial instruments (1) 13 — 13 — 80 — 51 29 Financial liabilities carried at fair value Derivative financial instruments (1) 159 — 42 117 40 — 26 14 Contingent consideration (2) — — — — 39 — — 39 Financial liabilities carried at amortized cost Long-term debt (3) 12,656 — 12,649 — 10,499 — 9,989 — (1) At December 31, 2024, all derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value through earnings, except for $5 million in interest rate derivative financial assets that have been designated as cash flow hedges (2023: $18 million). (2) Under the terms of the agreements on Pembina's investment in the Cedar LNG Project, Pembina had committed to make additional payments on a positive FID. Following the positive FID outcome in June 2024, the consideration payable is no longer contingent in nature. (3) Carrying value of current and non-current balances. Includes loans and borrowings and subordinated hybrid notes. Changes in fair value of the derivative net liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy were as follows: For the year ended December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Level 3 derivative net asset at January 1 15 30 Loss included in revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts (132) (15) Level 3 derivative net (liability) asset at December 31 (117) 15 There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2024. 136 Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report

Hedge Accounting a. Net Investment Hedges Pembina has designated certain U.S. dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the Company's net investment in U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries and investments in equity accounted investees. This hedging activity is in aid of Pembina’s risk management strategy for foreign exchange risk. The designated debt has been assessed as having no ineffectiveness as the U.S. dollar denominated debt has an equal and opposite exposure to U.S. dollar fluctuations. The designated debt is recorded in loans and borrowings on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and all related gains and losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income. The details of the U.S. dollar denominated debt are as follows: For the years ended December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Notional amount of U.S. debt designated (in U.S. dollars) 250 250 Carrying value of U.S. debt designated 360 330 Maturity date 2025 2025 b. Cash Flow Hedges Pembina has designated interest rate forward swaps as hedging instruments to manage interest rate risk exposure related to Credit Facilities. The designated interest rate forward swaps are recorded in derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and all related gains or losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income, with realized gains or losses reclassified to net finance costs. The details of the interest rate forward swap derivative instruments are as follows: For the years ended December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Notional amount of interest rate forward swaps 360 331 Carrying value of interest rate forward swaps 5 18 Maturity date 2025 2025 Gains and Losses from Derivative Instruments For the years ended December 31 ($ millions) 2024 2023 Derivative instruments held at fair value through earnings Realized (gain) loss Commodity-related gain recorded in revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts (1) (241) (315) Foreign exchange loss recorded in net finance costs — 15 Unrealized loss (gain) Commodity-related loss recorded in revenue from risk management and physical derivative contracts (1) 170 32 Foreign exchange gain recorded in net finance costs — (18) Derivative instruments in hedging relationships Interest rate loss recorded in other comprehensive income (2) 10 13 (1) Comparative 2023 period has been adjusted. See Note 4 Changes in Accounting Policies. (2) Unrealized losses or gains for designated cash flow hedges are recognized in impact of hedging activities in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income, with realized losses or gains being reclassified to net finance costs. As at December 31, 2024 the movement in other comprehensive income includes a realized gain of $17 million (2023: $16 million realized gain). No losses or gains have been recognized in net income relating to discontinued cash flow hedges. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 137

25. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Pembina's objective when managing capital is to ensure a strong financial position and a stable stream of dividends to shareholders that is sustainable over the long-term. Pembina manages its capital structure based on requirements arising from significant capital development activities, the risk characteristics of its underlying asset base and changes in economic conditions. Pembina manages its capital structure and short-term financing requirements using non-GAAP measures, including the ratios of debt to adjusted EBITDA, debt to total enterprise value, adjusted cash flow to debt, debt to equity, and rating agency metrics such as funds from operations to debt. The metrics are used to measure Pembina's financial leverage and measure the strength of Pembina's balance sheet. Pembina remains satisfied that the leverage currently employed in its capital structure is appropriate given the characteristics and operations of the underlying asset base. Pembina maintains a conservative capital structure that allows it to finance its day-to-day cash requirements through its operations, without requiring external sources of capital. Pembina funds its operating commitments, short-term capital spending as well as its dividends to shareholders through this cash flow, while new borrowing and equity issuances are primarily reserved for the support of specific significant development activities. The capital structure of Pembina consists of shareholder's equity, comprised of common and preferred equity, and long-term debt. Long-term debt is comprised of bank credit facilities, unsecured notes, and subordinated hybrid notes. Note 17 of these financial statements shows the change in share capital for the year ended December 31, 2024. 26.

28. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments Pembina was committed for the following amounts under its contracts and arrangements as at December 31, 2024: Contractual Obligations (1) Payments Due by Period ($ millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 – 3 years 3 – 5 years After 5 years Transportation and processing (2) 10,766 83 81 565 10,037 Construction commitments (3) 409 396 13 — — Other commitments related to lease contracts (4) 430 43 83 78 226 Funding commitments, software, and other 46 14 24 8 — Total contractual obligations 11,651 536 201 651 10,263 (1) Pembina enters into product purchase agreements and power purchase agreements to secure supply for future operations. Purchase prices of both NGL and power are dependent on current market prices. Volumes and prices for NGL and power contracts cannot be reasonably determined, and therefore, an amount has not been included in the contractual obligations schedule. Product purchase agreements range from one to 17 years and involve the purchase of NGL products from producers. Assuming product is available, Pembina has secured between 16 and 148 mbpd of NGL each year up to and including 2041. Power purchase agreements range from one to 25 years and involve the purchase of power from electrical service providers. Pembina has secured up to 76 megawatts per day each year up to and including 2050. (2) Pembina signed two agreements relating to the Cedar LNG Project: (a) Liquefaction Tolling Services Agreement ("LTSA"); and, (b) Gas Supply Agreement ("GSA"). The LTSA is a 20-year take-or-pay fixed toll contract for 1.5 million tonnes per annum, while the GSA will allow for transport on the Coastal GasLink pipeline approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of Canadian natural gas to Cedar LNG. These commercial agreements account for approximately 50 percent of Cedar LNG's operating capacity and a total commitment of approximately $10.5 billion. These commitments are expected to commence upon the anticipated in-service date of the Cedar LNG Project in late 2028. (3) Excludes significant projects that are awaiting regulatory approval, projects which Pembina is not committed to construct, and projects that are executed by equity accounted investees. (4) Relates to expected variable lease payments excluded from the measurement of the lease liability, payments under lease contracts which have not yet commenced, and payments related to non-lease components in lessee lease contracts. Commitments to Equity Accounted Investees Pembina has commitments to provide contributions to certain equity accounted investees based on annual budgets approved by the joint venture partners and contractual agreements. Contingencies Pembina, including its subsidiaries and its investments in equity accounted investees, are subject to various legal and regulatory and tax proceedings, actions and audits arising in the normal course of business. Pembina represents its interests vigorously in all proceedings in which it is involved. Legal and administrative proceedings involving possible losses are inherently complex, and the Company applies significant judgment in estimating probable outcomes. As at December 31, 2024, there were no significant claims filed against Pembina for which management believes the resolution of any such actions or proceedings would have a material impact on Pembina's financial position or results of operations. Letters of Credit Pembina has provided letters of credit to various third parties in the normal course of conducting business. The letters of credit include financial guarantees to counterparties for product purchases and sales, transportation services, utilities, engineering and construction services. The letters of credit have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on Pembina's financial position, earnings, liquidity or capital resources. As at December 31, 2024, Pembina had $209 million (2023: $201 million) in letters of credit issued. Pembina Pipeline Corporation 2024 Annual Report 141

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Friday, February 23, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cameron Goldade, Chief Financial Officer of Pembina Pipeline. Please go ahead. Cameron Goldade Thank you, Goldie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pembina's conference call and webcast to review highlights from the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. On the call today we also have Scott Burrows, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with other members of Pembina's leadership team, including Jaret Sprott, Janet Loduca, Stuart Taylor, and Chris Scherman. I would like to remind you that some of the comments made today may be forward-looking in nature and are based on Pembina's current expectations, estimates, judgments, and projections. Forward-looking statements made, expressed or implied today are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further, some of the information provided refers to non-GAAP measures. To learn more about these forward- looking statements and non-GAAP measures, please see the company's management discussion and analysis dated February 22, 2024, for the period ended December 31, 2023, as well as the press release Pembina issued yesterday, which are available online at pembina.com and on both SEDAR and EDGAR. I'll now turn things over to Scott to make some opening remarks. J. Burrows Thanks, Cam. We were pleased yesterday to report our fourth quarter results, which included quarterly earnings of $698 million and record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion. We also delivered record annual adjusted EBITDA of $3.82 billion, which exceeded the high end of the original 2023 guidance range and reflects the strength, predictability, and resilience of Pembina's business.  󰍉 PPL 󰍝  3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 1/14

In 2023, we saw growing volumes across many systems, supplemented by the value enhancement from another strong year from Pembina's marketing business. The positive momentum in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin could be seen by more than 4% year-over-year increase in second half volumes in the conventional pipeline business. In 2023, Pembina progressed its strategy by sustaining and enhancing our business through various accomplishments we shared throughout the past year, including signing new contracts from the Peace Pipeline system; signing new or extending existing contracts of the Redwater Complex; reactivating the Nipisi Pipeline; and approving new projects such as the 55,000 barrel per day RFS IV expansion; the expansion of the Northeast BC pipeline; and a cogeneration facility at PGI's Kaybob 3 Plant. In the fourth quarter, positive developments continued, including the announcement of a $3.1 billion acquisition of Enbridge's interest in Alliance/Aux Sable. Pembina's business is built around integrated difficult-to-replicate assets that provide an enduring competitive advantage and unequalled market access for customers. Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable are world-class energy infrastructure assets and increasing our existing ownership with them will further enhance our growing franchise. We continue to expect the acquisition to close in the first half of 2024, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. On the commercial front, we announced yesterday that in support of Dow's Path2Zero project, Pembina has entered into long-term agreements to supply up to 50,000 barrels per day of ethane and for the associated transportation on the Alberta Ethane Gathering System. The Path2Zero project is an important development for the WCSB, representing a significant increase to the current ethane market in Alberta. Given Pembina's existing leading ethane supply and transportation business and integrated value chain, there are multiple opportunities for the company to benefit from this new development through both the existing asset base and new investment opportunities. During the fourth quarter, we also closed open seasons on the Cochin pipeline for a total of 90,000 barrels per day and signed an incremental contract with an anchor customer for service on the Nipisi Pipeline, which is now contracted for more than half the capacity on a long-term basis, with line of sight to the asset being fully contracted by the end of 2024. On the major project front, we continued to progress our Phase VIII Peace Pipeline Expansion and our RFS IV expansion of the Redwater Complex. On the Phase VIII project, the capital budget has been further revised lower to $430 million, which is $100 million under the original budget. The construction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2024 with pipeline and facility commissioning and start-up expected in the second quarter of 2024. Our experience with Phase VIII is another example of supporting Pembina's track record of strong project execution. Additionally, Pembina gas infrastructure has provided -- has approved an expansion at the Wapiti plant that will increase natural gas processing capacity by 115 million cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in the first half of 2026. The Wapiti expansion is being driven by strong customer demand, supported by growing Montney production and will be fully underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts. Finally, yesterday we provided an update on the Cedar LNG project. Cedar LNG has substantially completed several key project deliverables, including obtaining material of regulatory approvals; advancing inter-project agreements with Coastal GasLink and LNG Canada; signing a heads of agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries and Black & Veatch; and executing a lump sum engineering, procurement and construction agreement to provide Cedar LNG with the necessary services to construct the project. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 2/14

While a lot has been accomplished, there remain a number of schedule-driven interconnected elements that require resolution prior to making a final investment decision. These include binding commercial offtake, obtaining third-party consents and project financing. On this basis, a final investment decision is now expected in the middle of 2024. I will now turn things over to Cam to discuss some more detailed financial highlights for the 2023 fourth quarter and full year. Cameron Goldade Thanks, Scott. As Scott noted, Pembina recorded fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.03 billion. This represents a 12% increase over the same period in the prior year. In Pipelines, factors impacting the quarter primarily included higher volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, Drayton Valley Pipeline and on the recently reactivated Nipisi Pipeline; higher tolls primarily on the Cochin Pipeline and Peace Pipeline systems, largely related to contractual inflation adjustments; and lower contribution from the Alliance Pipeline, primarily due to lower interruptible tolls and volumes. In Facilities, factors impacting the quarter included higher contribution from the PGI assets, primarily from the former Energy Transfer Canada plants, the Hythe Plant, and the Dawson Assets due to higher volumes; and higher revenue at Vancouver Wharves. In Marketing and New Ventures, fourth quarter results reflect the net impact of higher contribution from Aux Sable; lower natural gas and crude oil marketing margins, largely offset by higher NGL margins; and realized losses on commodity-related derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to realized gains in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, in the Corporate segment, fourth quarter results were largely consistent with the same period in the prior year. Earnings in the fourth quarter were $698 million. This represents a 187% increase over the same period in the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, the increase in earnings in the fourth quarter was primarily due to the net impact of the impairment reversal related to the Nipisi Pipeline, the Ruby settlement provision and associated legal fees incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, lower project write-offs, higher depreciation and unrealized gain on commodity-related derivatives compared to a loss in the fourth quarter of 2022, lower net finance cost, and higher income tax expense and the recognition of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset. Total volumes were 3.45 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 2% over the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline, higher volumes on the Peace and Drayton Valley pipelines, higher volumes from PGI and lower volumes at the Redwater Complex. The fourth quarter contributed to full year results that included earnings of $1.776 billion, record adjusted EBITDA of $3.824 billion, which was 2% higher than in 2022 and exceeded the high end of the company's original guidance range; cash flow from operating activities of $2.635 billion and adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $2.646 billion. Thanks to strong results, Pembina generated meaningful free cash flow, which was allocated to strengthening the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 3/14

In 2023, we raised the common share dividend by 2.3%, repurchased $50 million of common shares and continue to reduce its leverage below the low end of the target range. At December 31, 2023, based on the trailing 12 months, the ratio of proportionally consolidated debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.3x, reflective of our strong balance sheet and supporting a strong BBB credit rating. I'll now turn things back to Scott. J. Burrows Thanks, Cam. In closing, we are enthusiastic about the future given the current momentum in the WCSB and expect continued volume growth through 2024 and beyond. Our broader outlook remains unchanged as we see the potential for mid-single-digit growth driven by tangible near-term catalysts, including up to approximately $2.8 billion -- or 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of new natural gas export capacity from the new West Coast LNG projects; 590,000 barrels per day of new crude oil export capacity from the expected completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion; and potential new developments in the Alberta petrochemical industry; including significant incremental ethane demand associated with Dow's Path2Zero project. Given the scope and reach of our business, Pembina is uniquely positioned to benefit from these catalysts. Our investors have come to expect strong and consistent financial leadership from us, demonstrated by a secure and growing dividend and unwavering commitment to our financial guardrails, a low-risk and primarily fee-based business with high take-or-pay or cost -of-service contributions, and a strong balance sheet. You can expect us to continue to execute our strategy with the same financial discipline that has made us successful to date. In closing, I believe the next 5 years will be an exciting time in the Canadian energy industry. With exceptional resources, greater access to global markets and leading environmental and social performance standards, Canada's energy industry has an opportunity for greatness. I'm extremely proud of what Pembina and the rest of our industry do to ensure responsibly produced energy is available to meet growing global demand. Thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, please go ahead and open up the line for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet Just wanted to go into the Dow announcement a little bit more as far as this ethane supply agreement is concerned. And wondering if you could frame up I guess, is this all incremental ethane extraction kind of upside new to the system? Is there any redirection? And also, how much of this would you characterize as brownfield versus greenfield investments here? Just trying to get a sense for what the project economics could look like here? Jaret Sprott Jeremy, Jaret here. Yes, great question. So super excited to obviously announce our contribution to Dow's net zero cracker here in Alberta. With respect to our supply, it is going to be a material increase to Pembina's overall supply. It will require us to spend incremental capital with respect to getting that supply. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 4/14

We've spoken previously about RFS III. That was originally designed as a C3+ fractionator, but it has the optionality for us to put DS on it. So that would be a brownfield expansion. There are other opportunities at Empress and through PGI and/or Pembina wholly-owned extraction assets that we see opportunities. We also obviously see amounts of positive with respect to utilization across our asset base. And with 50,000 barrels of ethane, obviously, a bunch of C3+ comes along with that. So it is going to be a mix of brownfield and greenfield opportunities for Pembina and higher utilization across the board. And then on the AEGS pipeline, Pembina has announced that we're going to be 50,000 barrels. We fully expect that we're not the only contributor to Dallas supply portfolio. We don't know where the other portions of that supply portfolio are coming from. So once we understand where that's coming from, we'll be in a better position to update you all on AEGS' expansions. Jeremy Tonet Got it. That's very helpful there. And is there any way to frame what the potential capital deployment sizing or time frame or sizing really could be for this? J. Burrows Yes. Jeremy, it's Scott here. We've been progressing, as Jaret pointed out, multiple options. We're working the engineering and the economics of all of those. So I would say probably by midyear, we'll be in a better position to update the market and kind of which projects we predict will be going forward. But suffice to say, no material CapEx in 2024. Jeremy Tonet Got it. Understood. And just one last one, if I could. Nipisi pipe and reactivation here, I was just wondering if you could speak a bit more on the market drivers to this and I guess commercial momentum here. What you see in the market? Is there potential to -- could this be fully filled up? What type of time frame could that materialize over? And what are the drivers here? Jaret Sprott I'll take that again, Jeremy. So the drivers are the Clearwater formation. So a lot of activity in that neighborhood. And we expect the pipeline to honestly be fully contracted by the end of 2024. We put it back into service last year. We're seeing very strong utilization, physical utilization today. We've signed up incremental contracts, which I believe we announced at the end of last year. And yes, fully see line of sight of having that 100% contracted by year-end. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 5/14

Page 6
Robert Hope I want to stick on the Dow announcement and the supply [Technical Difficulty] in West Group. When you look at the options, do you expect that the incremental ethane supply sources will all be Western Canadian? Or could you be pushing some incremental barrels on Vantage. I just want to get a sense of whether or not you're expecting this all to be Western Canada or some of the Bakken? J. Burrows Yes. Rob, look, again, this ethane is going to be supplied from a mix of the existing portfolio as well as new. And the new ethane will come from some of the various projects that we're currently evaluating, as we discussed. There definitely is an option to move incremental barrels on Vantage out of the Bakken. So that is a very real possibility to supply. Robert Hope Appreciate that. And then maybe just moving over to kind of the volume outlook for 2024, a number of moving parts, including, we'll call it, rather strong condensate pricing offset by weak AECO pricing. When you're talking to your producer customers, how do you think volumes progress through the year? Should we see a little bit of softness in the front part and then ramping up into LNG Canada in 2025? J. Burrows Yes. Rob, I think we continue to believe in that mid-single-digit growth that we talked about. But we are monitoring producer CapEx budgets pretty closely and have ongoing discussions. And so, certainly, it's on the back -- it's on -- it's top of mind in terms of what producers are going to do throughout the rest this year. But to your point, obviously, we'd like AECO to be a little bit higher for our producing community. But with oil at $77 condensate premium and Canadian dollar earning over $100 for your condensate carries the day a lot of the time. And so we still believe that our producers' economics are very robust, just given where condensate pricing is. But we are certainly watching producer budgets given the weakness in AECO. Jaret Sprott And I would just add to that, Rob, on top of the liquids market or the condensate market, obviously, the NGL market has bounced around a little bit. But certainly, December-January and into February here, we've seen some strength there. And obviously, the arb into the Far East markets continues to be open and supportive for that as well. So we do see that buffering the weaker gas prices as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Linda Ezergailis from TD Cowen. Linda Ezergailis 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 6/14

Recognizing we'll likely get an update on Cedar LNG midyear. Just wondering how we might think about the bookings of cost estimates for the project recognizing that a few things have moved around, including foreign exchange since you first announced the project? Cameron Goldade Yes. Linda, it's Cam here. I guess we'll continue to defer being very specific about that question until we can really tell the whole story around the opportunity. I mean, obviously, when we bought into that project, we announced the capital cost of in the mid USD 2 billion range. Obviously, the world has changed since then. And I think we all recognize that it's going to be higher than that. That said, when we look at Cedar from a global competitiveness standpoint, we see that it continues to stack up very well from a cost per ton basis against the North American alternatives into the global markets, reflecting both the capital intensity, but also the West Coast advantages in terms of shipping that Cedar enjoys. So recognizing that there's a desire for more specificity, we'll probably leave it at that until we can tell the full story. Linda Ezergailis Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, if you can help us understand, given all of what you just shared in terms of that compelling advantage, has anything changed about your return expectations for the project? Would you expect kind of similar returns even with a higher capital cost, or potentially higher given the compelling locational advantages? Or maybe were your initial returns higher and they've come down a bit? Is there anything that you can point towards directionally? Cameron Goldade Yes. I would say from where we look at this project from this point in the development cycle, the economics of Cedar continue to reflect what we would have seen historically in terms of greenfield type returns for projects of this sort. They're clearly not where the brownfield opportunities are. And obviously, we've got a number of those as well. But they would continue to be in that same sort of historical range, that mid to high single-digit kind of range. Linda Ezergailis And just maybe commercially as well, recognizing that there's a few moving parts, can you talk about what the potential sticking points are about getting to firm offtake agreements? And what sort of mix of take-or-pay versus fee-for-service or other attributes would you be looking for in any offtake agreements? J. Burrows Linda, it's Scott here. I think really it's time. There's just a lot of different agreements that have to be put in place. And so we're continuing to progress detailed negotiations. But a lot of it is just due to time and the interdependency of so many different agreements on this project. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 7/14

Page 8
In terms of our structure, recall that this project will be project financed. And so just by the nature of that, this project will need to have significant underpinning in order to proceed on that basis. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier I have a follow-up here on the ethane supply agreement. I'm wondering if you could explain the exposure that you have on that agreement to commodity prices and volumes. Jaret Sprott Yes, Rob. I think that -- if you think about the way that ethane is contracted in Western Canada, it's obviously different than other parts of North America. And so generally speaking, the way that works is that it's ultimately for folks like us a fee-based structure. But the way that Pembina really makes money on this is through transportation and provision of the volumes through the rest of the asset base. So as we sit today through the conventional business, through the transmission business, through the deep cuts and the gas plants and the fractionators. It's really sort of the tolling model that is the value driver for the ethane molecule, along with the associated C3+ that comes with those molecules when you extract it. Robert Catellier Right. So to the extent the market is short or tight and maybe short volumes or the price is up, that ultimately is borne by the counterparty. Jaret Sprott That's correct. Robert Catellier Right. And then I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about the degree of additional costs for some of the emerging regulations and amended methane regulation, for example, clean fuel regulation, et cetera, et cetera. Typically, we would expect any change of law or tightening of these regulations to have some cost sharing with your customers. But as -- it seems like a pretty, I guess, a continually evolving landscape as far as environmental regulation goes. But as you look over the horizon in the next 3 to 5 years, is there any substantial change to your cost structure that's not otherwise shared with shippers or producers? J. Burrows 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 8/14

Page 9
Not at this stage, Rob. I mean, I think we're continuing to assess all the existing and pending regulations. We continue to work on decarbonization of all the assets and really understanding where we can get the best emission reductions for the best dollar value. As it relates to contracting, as you pointed out, many of the assets have cost-sharing arrangements, which protects us a little bit. But we also have assets like Empress where we're fully exposed and we're working on what the implications are of that. But at this stage, there's no, what I'd call, material change in the cost structure. Robert Catellier Okay. Last question for me is, just are there any significant implications for Chevron selling their Duvernay assets in terms of your business development? Jaret Sprott No major implications, Rob, actually. We're excited. We're going to support Chevron through the transaction. Chevron, I would say, has taken a modest approach to the development in the area. And we believe that upon divestment of those assets, the acquirer may take a more advanced or aggressive approach on developing those resources, which will benefit PGI and the rest of Pembina's infrastructure. J. Burrows Yes. Rob, if you look back at, say, over the last 18 months, there's been a fair bit of M&A activity in Canada on the asset side. And I think what we've seen historically has been new acquirers tend to deploy more capital than previous owners, whether that's to make their transactions go around or that's obviously what they believe in at the time of the transaction. And so we have found M&A over the last 18 months to actually be an acceleration. You've seen that in the increased utilization across the PGI assets. So Chevron is a great counterparty. But we would expect potentially higher volumes over the relatively near future through an acquisition of a third party. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish I guess 2 more questions here on the Dow agreement. So the supply agreement of 50,000 barrels, as you mentioned, I mean, that's not the full ethane supply. I think it's only about half of the crackers needs. And I guess I'm just struggling to think about who could satisfy the balance of the ethane just given your position. But I guess even if there's another 50,000 barrels of ethane coming from other plants in the region, can you still pick up a benefit by moving some of that third-party supply through your pipelines? J. Burrows 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 9/14

Page 10
Yes. Again, we don't have line of sight to where the rest of the ethane is coming from and in what phase and what time line, so potentially a question for others. But depending on where that ethane comes from, we would have an opportunity to move it on our pipelines. Again, we have the only C2+ pipeline in operations today, gathering lines. And so -- and we have a pretty big frac footprint. So there is the potential. But at this stage, we're not aware of where the next -- or where the rest of the ethane is coming from. Praneeth Satish Got it. And then kind of second question on this project. I mean you talked about the potential to produce more propane and butane from increasing the NGL cut on your plants for the project. I guess how are you thinking about the end markets for this incremental supply of C3+? Is there may be enough to consider an LPG export dock expansion? Or will it get railed into the U.S.? Chris Scherman It's Chris here. Yes, we certainly are tracking that closely and recognize that with the ethane will come more propane and butane. It's likely that it's going to find a path to the West Coast. So we're back revisiting what we can do at our facility. We're looking at what others are doing and watching that closely. And I think it will inevitably spur something on the West Coast. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Robert Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan I can start with the topic of the day with Dow. And so you talked about the potential to put a DS on the front of RFS III. What other capital should you see going into the system, whether its compression or deep cuts out in the field? And just under the agreement then with Dow, given you're still working through cost of everything, does the agreement specify a return on the capital? Or are you taking the risk on how all of this capital needs to come together within whatever fee you've agreed with, with Dow? J. Burrows Yes, Rob. I have to be careful what I say because we have obviously confidential arrangements. But we are obligated -- it is a supply arrangement, so we're obligated to provide the ethane. We are -- again, going back to the initial comments. We have a mix here where a significant portion will come from existing assets or very light capital touch to existing assets. And then in terms of the new supply, we do have a mix. And so you pointed out potentially as an example incremental deep cuts, RFS III, DS. There's other opportunities that we just can't talk about at this stage that we're exploring. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 10/14

Page 11
And so for us, it will be about how to get the most ethane for the least amount of cost. And that's something that we're currently assessing right now. And I know there's a lot of questions on it, but we're just not at the stage where we can provide that detail. And we'll look to do that once we make some of these decisions on a go- forward basis. But it will be an overall mix of existing assets, light touch, brownfield and then some incremental greenfield investments. Robert Kwan Got it. And Scott, can I just square your comments here up with an answer earlier, that, if the market is caught short and there is a need to go out and attract ethane supply at a high price -- I know that most of ethane is cost- of-service in the province. But if you have to do that, there was a statement that, that is going to be borne by Dow. So how does that square up just in terms of your obligations to supply? J. Burrows Yes. Sorry, Rob. I'll clarify my comments. What I meant was that the cost -- the pass-through to ultimately the producer who is providing the ethane, there's an arrangement there. But it's a supply agreement and we have the obligation to supply. So we have a capital cost element to that. But there's -- the price is fixed. Robert Kwan Okay. If I could just shift to Cedar. You listed a number of things that you've got to work through. One of them that you didn't list, though, is just around costs. So coming out of the FEED study, are you comfortable with where those costs are, how you're going to manage the risk? And it really is now, how do you deal with the commercial on the other side? I guess, specifically on costs, can you just talk about how you are planning on managing cost overrun risk? And specifically, you've talked about fixed price EPCs. But how are you planning on protecting yourself against the material type of overruns that we've seen in other projects that have led to contractor bankruptcies? J. Burrows Yes, Rob. I'll start there and, Stu, feel free to jump in. But again, part of the timing around this project was ensuring that we had a very robust EPC contract, lump-sum, turnkey. Again, this is a ship being built in Korea, in Samsung shipyard under a controlled environment with LNG modules being placed on top of it. And that is all under a lump sum turnkey arrangement, which is the vast majority of the cost, which -- again, we'll lay this all out if we are fortunate enough to make an FID decision. So I'm not trying to be coy. There's just a lot of moving pieces. But on that piece, we feel very, very comfortable given the robustness of the contract that we negotiated that the vast majority of that price has been pushed off onto our EPC contract. The remaining price that's on risk for Pembina is pipeline and transmission lines. And it's a 9-kilometer pipeline, a 10-kilometer pipeline. I think given our track record, I would hope that market has some confidence around our ability to deliver on that. I mean you just saw Phase VIII come in materially under budget. So we feel confident around doing our core business on this asset. And then, of course, on top of that, we have a typical project contingency and protection. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 11/14

Page 12
So overall, we feel good mainly because of we went with a lump sum engineering contract. And those always cost a little bit more, but from a risk-reward basis, we like that approach to major projects. Robert Kwan A quick one here just on the Alliance, Aux Sable deal. You've got HSR. But can you just comment on where you are in the Canadian Competition Bureau approval? Jaret Sprott Yes, Rob. I would say that timing-wise, you can see that we reiterated our second half -- first half of 2024 time frame. You're correct. We've got the waiting period expiry on HSR in Transport Canada. I would say we don't have any better information at this point on the Competition Bureau process to refine that view anymore. Things are progressing as expected, as planned, but no sort of further visibility at this point to try and narrow that date. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Zack Van Everen from TPH. Zackery Van Everen Just going to Fort Sask frac market. It seems like a lot of those facilities are running close to full. I was just curious if you guys had any incremental room to capture if spot rates moved up. And then as you talk to producers, are frac constraints becoming more and more of a concern? Jaret Sprott Jaret here. The answer to your question is yes. But we -- it is becoming a concern for our customers. But it's also -- we don't have a lot of opportunity, unfortunately, because we're fully contracted for the most part. We don't have a lot of opportunity to get a lot of spot rates. The NGL season does start on April 1. So the teams are obviously in deep negotiations with respect to annual deals. But the majority of our contracts at our fractionation complex are long term in nature, 5, 10-plus years. So unfortunately, where we can grab those opportunities, we do. But it is long term in nature. J. Burrows But certainly, future frac negotiations continue to progress. And with RFS being the next frac in service -- RFS IV being the next frac in service, we have the option to continue to progress those negotiations and sign up incremental barrels. That's predicted to come online in the first half of 2026. And it's really the next material frac expansion that we're aware of. And so those discussions continue. Zackery Van Everen 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 12/14

Page 13
Very good. Perfect. That's super helpful. And then, one on Cochin. It seems like Cochin and competing pipes saw oversubscribed shipper interest. I was curious if you could squeeze any more capacity out of that system with smaller capital-efficient solutions? Or maybe there's a bigger project you guys could do as well? Jaret Sprott I'll take that again. So Cochin, since we've acquired that asset in December of 2019, we've increased the throughput by roughly, I think, 25%, 30%, and safely. So I would say that we're meeting all of customer demand today. Our availability is extremely high. But I don't think there's -- without a major expansion, there's not a lot of room, unfortunately, left on that asset. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Kenny from National Bank Financial. Patrick Kenny Just on the Wapiti expansion, nice to see the commercial support there. Wondering if you could just update us on what other G&P expansion opportunities might be in the queue across your portfolio based on the customer activity levels that you're seeing in the field these days. Jaret Sprott I can't speak to specifics, Pat. But I think a couple of quarters ago I mentioned that we had line of sight to a substantial amount of capital to be deployed on a gross and a net basis through PGI. But obviously, with the K3 Cogen, which is going to obviously increase the reliability of that asset, lower the carbon intensity, the Wapiti expansion that will utilize the asset gas transmission line that we acquired through the Energy Transfer Canada acquisition. We have other opportunities to do, I would call it, field-based processing. But incrementally through PGI with the partnership with Dow and our incremental C2 supply agreement, we have opportunities to deploy more capital on the field-based extraction as well. So I can't get into the specifics, but lots of opportunities for sure. Patrick Kenny And then maybe from a tuck-in or M&A perspective, curious, Jaret, if you're seeing any shift in producer appetite for third-party gas processing services, just given the outlook for gas prices at least through the summer and maybe their need to secure downstream access and maximize the value of their liquids production within their overall netbacks. Jaret Sprott Yes. I would say no material change in the market. There continues to be -- its very producer specific in terms of certain producers want to own and operate, and that's core to their business. And others look at what opportunities there are for mid-streamers to enhance their capital allocation decisions. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1867800239&ts=3043027&ref=l6cin7 13/14

Page 14
And so, I would say it's -- those discussions are ongoing and always have been and it's really producer specific. But I wouldn't say there's any kind of material step change given gas prices or anything like that. It would be normal course. J. Burrows I would say, though, Pat, that any acquisitions we do through PGI, obviously, we have to be on site with our partner. But we really want to make sure that we're focused on the geology, that we're buying processing assets that have long reserve life indexes, and then obviously contribute to the rest of Pembina's value chain. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our Q&A session. I would like to turn it back to Pembina's President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Burrows, for closing remarks. J. Burrows Well, thank you, everyone. Thanks to our staff that are listening in, to our customers. We really appreciate all the hard work. And thank you to all the investors and analysts on the call. 2023 was an exceptional year for our company, and we're pretty excited about what we can deliver in 2024. So thank you, everyone.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Friday, May 10, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Tucunel, Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Dan Tucunel Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pembina's conference call and webcast to review highlights for the first quarter of 2024. On the call today, we have Scott Burrows, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cameron Goldade, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, along with other members of Pembina's leadership team, including Jaret Sprott, Janet Loduca, Stu Taylor, and Chris Scherman. I would like to remind you that some of the comments made today may be forward looking in nature and are based on Pembina's current expectations, estimates, judgments, and projections. Forward-looking statements we may express or imply today are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further, some of the information provided refers to non-GAAP measures. To learn more about these forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures, please see the company's Management's Discussion and Analysis dated May 9, 2024, for the period ended March 31, 2024, as well as the press release Pembina issued yesterday, which are all available online at pembina.com and on both SEDAR and EDGAR. I will now turn things over to Scott to make some opening remarks. J. Burrows Thanks, Dan. A strong first quarter was highlighted by a record adjusted EBITDA of CAD 1.044 billion, which provided a great start to 2024 and built upon our great momentum from the second half of 2023. In addition, recent industry developments and company successes have further bolstered our enthusiasm for the future of Pembina. On April 1, 2024, we announced the completion of the Alliance and Aux Sable acquisition. We are excited to further enhance our business by increasing our ownership in these unique and world-class assets. The Alliance and Aux Sable acquisition aligns with Pembina's strategy of growing and strengthening our existing  󰍉 PPL 󰍝  3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 1/13

franchise and providing greater exposure to resilient end use markets and lighter hydrocarbons. We executed this transaction with discipline and accretively to our financial guardrails. In conjunction with the acquisition closing, Pembina updated its 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to CAD 4.05 billion to CAD 4.30 billion, which at the midpoint represents a CAD 300 million increase over the previous range. The revised outlook for 2024 primarily reflects the incremental contribution from increased ownership of Alliance and Aux Sable, as well as stronger outlook in the marketing business due to wider frac spreads. As previously announced during the first quarter, Pembina entered into a long-term agreement with Dow Chemical to supply and transport up to 50,000 barrels per day of ethane to support the recently announced construction of a new integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives facility in Fort Saskatchewan. Dow's Path2Zero project is an important development for the industry, representing a significant increase to the current ethane demand in Alberta. Given Pembina's existing leading ethane supply and transportation business and extensive integrated value chain, there are multiple opportunities for the company to benefit from this new development through both existing asset base and new investment opportunities. Finally, Pembina recently announced significant achievements in the development of the proposed Cedar LNG project, including securing long term commercial agreements and issuing a notice to proceed to its engineering, procurement, and construction contractors. Following these critical milestones, Cedar LNG and Pembina's partner, the Haisla Nation, have commenced their respective financing processes in advance of a final investment decision, which is expected by June 2024. On the major project front, the Phase VIII Peace Pipeline expansion has entered the commissioning stage and startup is expected this month, as well the RFS IV expansion at the Redwater complex and the Northeast B.C. mid-point pump station expansion are proceeding as planned, and during the first quarter, Pembina Gas Infrastructure approved an expansion at the Wapiti Gas Plant that will increase natural gas processing capacity by 115 million cubic feet per day. Additionally, Pembina continues to evaluate further expansions to support volume growth in Northeast B.C., including new pipelines and terminal upgrades on the Northeast B.C. pipeline and downstream systems between Taylor, British Columbia and Gordondale, Alberta. On April 23, 2024, Pembina filed its project application with the Canadian Energy Regulator. And finally, we are pleased to have raised our quarterly common share dividend by CAD 0.0225 per share, or 3.4%, beginning with the dividend to be paid in June. The increase reflects the continued growth of Pembina's fee-based business, which is benefiting from rising volumes and increasing utilization across many of its assets. We recognize the importance of our sustainable, reliable, and growing dividend to our shareholders, and we are proud of our long track record in this regard. It has been a very strong start to 2024, and we look forward to continuing the momentum. I will now turn things over to Cam to discuss in more detail the financial highlights for the first quarter. Cameron Goldade Thanks, Scott. As Scott noted, Pembina recorded record first quarter adjusted EBITDA of CAD 1.044 billion. This represents a 10% increase over the same period in the prior year. In Pipelines, factors impacting the first quarter primarily included higher revenues and volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, the Northern Pipeline system outage in the first quarter of 2023, which had an impact of CAD 40 million with no similar impacts for the first quarter of 2024. The reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline and higher contribution from Alliance Pipeline related to higher tolls on seasonal contracts. In Facilities, factors impacting the first quarter included higher volumes at the Redwater Complex and Younger compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the prior period was impacted by CAD 14 million due to the Northern 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 2/13

Pipeline system outage and higher operating expenses. In Marketing & New Ventures, first quarter results reflected the net impact of higher contribution from Aux Sable due to wider frac spreads and the new third-party marketing arrangement, change in the provision related to financial assurances for Cedar LNG, and realized losses on NGL-based derivatives in the first quarter of 2024 compared to realized gains in the first quarter of 2023. Finally, the Corporate segment was impacted by higher general and administrative costs, net of lower long- term incentive costs. Earnings in the fourth quarter were CAD 438 million. This represents a 19% increase over the same period in the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, earnings in the first quarter were impacted by unrealized losses on renewable power purchase agreements and on crude oil-based derivatives, compared to unrealized gains in the first quarter of 2023 and lower income tax expense. Pipeline volumes of 2.6 million barrels per day in the first quarter represent a 5% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes on the Peace Pipeline system resulting from earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue and the impact of the Northern Pipeline system outage in the first quarter of 2023, combined with the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline. Facilities volumes of 0.8 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2024 represent a 12% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes at the Redwater Complex and Younger as the first quarter of 2023 was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage, combined with higher interruptible volumes on certain PGI assets. Pembina continues to generate significant cash flow after dividends and maintain its strong balance sheet. At March 31, 2024, based on the trailing 12 months, the ratio of proportionally consolidated debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.4x, below the low end of its target range. I'll now turn things back to Scott. J. Burrows Thanks, Cam. For a few years now, Pembina has been highlighting key developments within the western Canadian energy industry that we believe will catalyze a wave of growth that will benefit Pembina, its customers, and all Canadians. These developments include LNG projects on Canada's west coast, the growth of Alberta's petrochemical industry, and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. All of us at Pembina wish to join the rest of industry and many others across Canada in celebrating the first of these to reach the finish line. The recent completion and shipment of first oil on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. This project brings much-needed new egress capacity for oil producers, providing greater access to global markets, and full value for Canada's energy resources, while helping to ensure responsibly produced energy is available to meet growing global demand. In closing, I want to remind you that Pembina will hold its annual meeting of common shareholders today at 2:00 p.m. Mountain time, 4:00 p.m. Eastern. It will be a virtual-only meeting conducted via live audio webcast. Participants are recommended to register for the virtual webcast at least 10 minutes before the presentation start time. Further, Pembina will hold our 2024 Investor Day in Toronto on May 16, beginning at 8:30 Eastern time. Our team is excited to provide an overview of the business and discuss in greater detail our strategy and the outlook for the company amidst truly transformational changes underway in the western Canadian energy industry. A live webcast event will be available on Pembina's website, and participants are encouraged to register well in advance. For further information on both the Annual Meeting and Investor Day, please visit the Investor tab at www.pembina.com. We would once again like to thank all our stakeholders for their support. Operator, please go ahead and open up the line for questions. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 3/13

Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet I just want to dive in a little bit more on the fundamentals as you see them before you. And just if you could walk through, I guess, producer customer conversations at this point and how you see activity unfolding over the balance of this year, the cadence of growth and how you see, I guess, that trajectory at this point. J. Burrows Yes, I'll start, Jeremy, and I'll invite any of my colleagues to jump in. I think what we're seeing is continued strong results across the board. Just previewing some of the results this week and last week, we're seeing many of our producers come in above expectations especially driven by strong condensate pricing, strong oil pricing, and again, in anticipation of some of these transformational events that we've been talking about for a while now. So, the conversations with producers have been great. The results are showing through, and we're seeing a lot of momentum in the business. Cameron Goldade Jeremy, it's Cam here. Maybe I'll just add that I think one of the things that we think makes Pembina unique is obviously our exposure to all the commodities in the industry here in the hydrocarbon value chain. And I think as you've seen results come out that Scott referenced, some folks who have the optionality to allocate capital between drier gas and more liquids rich gas are indeed shifting towards the liquids rich gas. And obviously both of those work for Pembina given the exposure in our portfolio. So, we see that as a real unique element for us and continue to see good runway in 2024. Jeremy Tonet And a little bit more time having passed since the Dow announcement. Just wondering if there's any incremental details or thoughts you could provide as far as the scope of the opportunity set and what it could mean for Pembina, particularly operating leverage versus brownfield versus greenfield opportunities. J. Burrows Jeremy, I think we'll dive into that a little bit more next week at our Investor Day. So we'll answer your question, but we'll do it next week. Jeremy Tonet Fair enough. And I think I might get the same answer for this one, but I'll try nonetheless. With leverage having fallen below, I guess, your targeted range, just any updated thoughts on capital allocation between growth CapEx, bolt-ons, dividend growth, buybacks, what have you? 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 4/13

Page 5
Cameron Goldade Yes, it's a fair comment, Jeremy. And I think as we look out at 2024 and 2025, potentially even the year after that, 2026, if we look at where we are today with some of the capital, the investment in Cedar through to the middle of this year, we're depending on where you choose your point in the range, we're relatively on point with funding all that capital with cash flow after dividends. And if you take forward that proxy and assume that we make a positive FID on Cedar later this year, 2025, probably not that different. And so, we continue to think that the most accretive and best use of that capital right now, obviously, are those opportunities which are in strategy and provide long-term annuities with strong counterparties and downside protection. That said, if something changes there, we'll do the same thing as we've always done and look at the opportunity set between repayment of debt. Obviously, we are at the low end of the range right now. Incremental buybacks, if they make sense from a capital allocation perspective, or other opportunities. Obviously, we continue to have a backlog beyond the things we're talking about and continue to advance those. So, probably not much different from what you heard from us in the past. Operator Your next question comes from Rob Hope of Scotiabank. Robert Hope I want to just ask on Alliance and Aux Sable. So, it's been in your hands for a little while now. Obviously, an asset you know well, but how are you progressing on thinking about commercial synergies there? And what is the time line that we could potentially look to? Jaret Sprott Rob, Jaret here. So, yes, April 2, we brought over 161 employees over to Pembina. So, step one is obviously business continuity, just working with Enbridge through the transition service agreement. And everything is going extremely well. We're just over a month into that. Commercial opportunities, I think it's a little bit early there right now, but the short term synergies that we had talked about when we announced the deal, those are going extremely well. And then that midterm- to longer-term synergies, expansions, different commercial opportunities just continuing to be worked on. Like you said, we know the asset well. We were the commercial operator of Alliance previously, and just continuing to work that and hopefully provide more color in the near future. Cameron Goldade And, Rob, maybe I'll just jump in. It's Cam. I think maybe to say it a different way, so far, nothing we've seen is deviating us from what we saw at the time of the announcement. We're tracking with the near term synergies that were immediately executable and continue to progress the ones that would obviously take a little bit more time. But we're not seeing anything at the moment that is necessarily derailing us from what we saw. Everything seems to be on track. J. Burrows 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 5/13

And I'll just pile on in terms of operations, not a synergy, but certainly with what's going on with Chicago gas price being a little bit lower than historical, we've seen a short-term tailwind at Aux Sable just with where frac spreads are. So, currently for 2024, Aux Sable was tracking above our acquisition model. Robert Hope And then actually maybe sticking with Marketing, a nice tailwind for the quarter. How are the spreads looking moving forward? And then can you add a little bit of color on the new marketing arrangement that was highlighted in the MD&A as a driver to your performance? Chris Scherman Rob, Chris Scherman. I think we definitely saw in Q1, as others referenced, really positive frac spreads. Gas in particular ended up being a tailwind there, as well as obviously some positive momentum on the crude side, which pulled up NGLs. We're still seeing some of that same tailwind, although a little bit muted here over the last couple weeks, as I think U.S. gas prices have come up a little bit, but in particular, NGL prices are seeing a little bit of pressure with some bigger inventory numbers. That said, we remain fairly positive on frac spreads for the remainder of the year and optimistic on that. Cameron Goldade And Rob, just on your second question, so the reference to the new marketing agreement is the same reference that we made at the time that we announced the acquisition of Alliance and Aux Sable. This would obviously be the first quarter where it's been in place. We'll go into specific details on it, as is customary for us with commercial agreements. But what I would say is that this agreement is simpler than the former one and obviously does create some opportunities for us in certain environments and down the line. So, a simplification and obviously some different participation at different pricing thresholds. Operator Your next question comes from Linda Ezergailis of TD Cowen. Linda Ezergailis I'll try to high-grade my high level questions, knowing that you're going to be sharing a lot with us at Investor Day. So, maybe more in the near term. We're hearing of low water levels in western Canada. We're hearing it's dry. There's concerns about wildfire risk. How are you preparing for that maybe in your marketing business and your operations? What is embedded into your guidance already versus maybe an emerging headwind for that? And can you talk us through what you're seeing on the ground and what your expectations are in terms of bookends of what the impact might be even on volumes on your systems as facilities might even be preemptively shut down in advance of certain wildfires in the areas you operate, et cetera? Jaret Sprott Linda, Jaret here. With respect to the first question, water levels and it being dry, that is 100% accurate. The conversations we have with our customers to date is the majority of our customers have retained the water that's 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 6/13

Page 7
required in their pits and/or their storage facilities. A lot of our customers have recycling operations, et cetera So, that's what we're hearing from them to date is that their ability to stimulate the wells go forward, they don't have a lot of concerns with that. Now, your second portion of the question was around wildfires. So, I would say, we're in a significantly better place as an industry, but definitely as an organization here at Pembina, we monitor wildfire activity on a 24/7 basis, and then there's nothing active to date near our assets that would give us any concern. There was no anticipation right now to be preemptively shutting in assets. And just to note, last year, any assets that we did shut in, they were primarily due to our ability to get our employees safely out of harm's way. So, the actual assets themselves were never in physical danger. It was the egress component is why we would have had to shut down last year. But I would say we're well-prepared, monitoring it, and hopefully we proceed through the summer. We just did get some pretty good rain here last few days, but definitely hoping for wetter weather. Linda Ezergailis And maybe just a follow-on question. Again, in discussions with your customers, how are they evolving commercially in terms of full-path solutions versus discrete services? And what is the tilt in terms of the offerings that you are leading with in those discussions? J. Burrows Linda, I would say no real change. Most of the discussions that we're continuing to have are integrated services, mainly pipe frac or gas plant pipe frac. I think the nice thing about having sanctioned RFS IV when we did was that we have that capacity coming online in 2026 in what is a relatively tight frac market. So, we think we're well positioned to continue our integrated value chain service offering. Operator Your next question comes from Robert Catellier of CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier As you're aware, there were some media reports over the last couple of weeks about a potential off-take agreement and alluding to a potential sale of an equity stake in Cedar LNG. I don't expect you to comment on any specific transaction, but can you maybe describe in more detail your appetite to sell an equity stake in Cedar LNG at all? It sounded like from Cam's comments on the funding plan that Pembina doesn't need any external equity or an equity partner for that project. Stuart Taylor Rob, it's Stu Taylor. We're continuing to progress our commercial conversations with a number of parties just on our intention to assign the Pembina capacity to an off-taker. With respect to the equity, there's no plans at this point in time for any equity structure change on the Cedar project. And at this point in time, all of those conversations would require approval from our partner as well. So, there is no equity change at this point in time. Robert Catellier 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 7/13

Page 8
Okay. And just on assigning that capacity to a third party, I'm just curious if you see any benefit in waiting too closer to the commercial operating date in an effort to maximize value once the project is derisked? Stuart Taylor We're looking at that, Rob. It's one of those things that we're looking at the timing. Nothing will take place until post-FID. We've been in conversations with a number of parties for a fair period of time. We continue to have ongoing conversations. And at the end of the day, we'll look at that timing. We think we have the opportunity to do the right deal for us, and so we'll evaluate that timing. And if the right deal comes in for us to execute, we will move on it. And if it means taking a bit more time, we'll do that as well. But we're actively engaged in conversations with people and making good progress on that. Robert Catellier Okay. And finally, it sounds like this might have to wait until next week, but I'm curious if there's any update on how you plan to source the supply of that thing for the transportation agreement with Dow. Cameron Goldade Yes. I think that's right, Rob. I think we'll probably punt that till next week and give everyone the benefit of rolling that out. Operator Your next question comes from Ben Pham of BMO. Benjamin Pham You mentioned the NEBC project. You have Cedar LNG and sounds like there's something on ethane Dow as well in terms of CapEx. And when you think about all those projects and maybe other projects ahead, where do you see annual CapEx spending the next 3 or 4 or 5 years, and at what point do you have to start to consider other sources of funding beyond the debt markets? Cameron Goldade Ben, it's Cam. I think picking up on my earlier comments, I would say that if we look forward right now, and let's play out a couple of scenarios, if we proceed and make a positive final investment decision on Cedar, we're probably running right around cash flow after dividends in terms of capital levels for the next couple of years, and then the heavy piece of the Cedar spend starts to trail off then. If we think about longer term, obviously, that's a little bit harder to gauge, but obviously, we continue to advance the backlog. But what I would say is, we're very conscious of not only the nature of the projects, but how they fit together as a program in terms of our strategy and also the funding piece. So, it is certainly an important input to the capital allocation process. 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 8/13

Page 9
If we look at a scenario where we didn't, in fact, proceed with Cedar, just to play that out for a moment, obviously, we would have substantially more free cash flow to work with. And obviously, per my earlier comments, we'd look at the same alternatives that we've discussed already. But ultimately, we've got some pretty attractive opportunities in front of us. And I think provided those continue on the path they're on, we'll be running probably pretty close to free cash flow at those levels for the next couple of years, at least. Benjamin Pham And apologies if I missed this. On your Facilities segment, you referenced operating expense pressure. I think that's the verbiage. Could you unpack that a bit? And can you also comment, is there anything you're seeing on maybe some of your producers curtailing production because of low ECHO prices? Jaret Sprott Like we've said before, I'll take the second part of your question. The majority of our assets, if not all of our assets, are pretty much in the liquids-rich window. So, we haven't seen any curtailment. And if we have, it's been so immaterial that we haven't noticed it. Our customers have great condensate yields and great NGL yields, which ultimately, even in a low ECHO natural gas price, we're still seeing strong volumes through PGI, et cetera No, we're not seeing anything. And with respect to cost pressures, not seeing anything out of the ordinary. It's just a little bit more work in certain areas that wasn't totally contemplated at the time. But no, just your normal supply chain and inflation pressures, but nothing out of the ordinary that is keeping us up, that's for sure. Cameron Goldade And, Ben, just to tag onto that, the one thing that we saw and did inform part of that variance this quarter was just you'll remember that the union agreement that was renegotiated in the port of Vancouver last year, that's showing up in the variance quarter-over-quarter in Q1. It's just a few million dollars, but that's part of the variance. Operator Your next question comes from Zack Van Everen of TPH & Company. Zackery Van Everen Just a question on the new pipeline you mentioned between Taylor and Gordondale. Would there be any additional infrastructure downstream needed to support that if you guys sanctioned that project? And then is there enough space on Peace and the fracs to accommodate the incremental liquids there? Jaret Sprott Yes, so once we cross the border from Taylor to Gordondale, there's no material incremental like pipelining work that's required from Gordondale into the Edmonton and/or the Fort Saskatchewan market. We will require some pump stations on certain segments of the line, and that's primarily from Fox Creek into the market, Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan. That has always been contemplated way back from the time of the Phase 3 expansion 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 9/13

Page 10
to grow those volumes. So we're extremely well positioned to capture those volumes without having to deploy a whole bunch of mainline capital. Zackery Van Everen And then maybe one on LPG exports. It's been very topical here in the States. And I was just curious if you had any updates around Prince Rupert expanding, and do you need any additional facilities there if that would be sanctioned? Chris Scherman Zack, it's Chris Scherman. We continue to see obviously this ramp up in western Canadian production, increased propane length in western Canada, as well we see the ramp up in the Lower 48. And that dynamic really pushes you towards the West Coast. We continue to look at our options there. We think we've got some really effective optimization options at our Prince Rupert facility, and we're looking to get more exposure to that market. So we continue to look at it and remain interested. Operator Your next question comes from Cole Pereira of Stifel. Cole Pereira Acknowledging you just completed an acquisition and you have a number of other large projects and opportunities in front of you. With TMX now in service, there's obviously still some uncertainty on tolls and other factors, but can you just refresh us on your thinking about how you see that asset fitting with your asset base and your strategy? Cameron Goldade Cole, it's Cam here. What I would say is, I think, obviously, we've been quite clear that global exports are a critical pillar in our strategy. Obviously, you can see just from the last question what a focus it is for us on the NGL side, obviously on LNG as well with Cedar. That said, I think we've been pretty consistent for some time. There exists a great deal of uncertainty still on TMX. Obviously, one very important milestone has passed with the pipeline coming into service, but I understand that the toll resolution process is ongoing and is likely to take some time to see resolution. And from our perspective, there still exists a tremendous amount of uncertainty around that asset. And so, frankly, nothing has changed from our prior messaging in terms of that as an investment opportunity. It's not something we're spending a great deal of time on right now, but obviously global exports are always important in our strategy. Operator Your next question comes from Robert Kwan of RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan 3/1/25, 12:36 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1877656127&ts=3154275&ref=l6cin7 10/13

Page 11
You've got a bunch of large projects, as you noted, [ LNG Canada ], TMX, and then your own Cedar. Just wondering, since you're talking with customers, what's the nature of the discussions at this point with respect to new projects following on those developments upstream infrastructure? Do you see a lot of potential there? J. Burrows I think for us, a lot of that was captured over the last call it 12 to 24 months with some of our Northeast B.C. arrangements that we entered into. We're starting to see those projects come to fruition in the next 12 to 24 months, which should provide some incremental volume growth in '25 and into '26. I think a lot of people are continuing to, as Jaret said, drill in the rich areas, especially in the condensate-rich areas. With the outlook for increased oil demand and ergo incremental condensate need, we're seeing a lot of activity in the condensate window. So we are starting to see it, Rob, show up, but not just short-term, but as people are sanctioning some of these projects into '25 and '26. Robert Kwan Just so I'm clear, you're talking about the 12 to 24 months, you're talking about projects that you've already announced or that you expect that we will see additional projects sanctioned over that next 12 to 24 months to drive the volumes? J. Burrows I'm saying both. We're seeing some of the volumes that we locked up, call it, a year ago, we're going to start to see those volumes materialize on the system in the next 12 to 24 months. And then we're also seeing and talking to producers about some of their developments that they could potentially sanction over the next 12 to 24 months, which would then drive volume further on in the plan. And that's always been what's given us confidence from talking about volume growth in that 5% range, we almost talked about it annually because that's the line of sight we had. But now, for the last 12 months, we've been saying that we have a view that could continue on for a couple of years here at least because we have much more visibility into that. Robert Kwan If you just look at the lower take-or-pay deferrals in the quarter, is that a function of a more bullish outlook or is that more so that you're just so deep into the fee-based components of the contracts that deferring is just overly conservative and unnecessary? Cameron Goldade Rob, what it really comes down to is us having a number of years under our belt now in terms of observing history, how producers trend throughout the year, their history in terms of accessing those make-up rights. And now we have a statistical body of information which we can look at to create a higher degree of certainty where we can be comfortable recognizing those volumes early in the year than we have previously.

And if I can just finish with a clarification. There's been a lot of talk around especially Cedar specifically but just CapEx and whether you would be free cash flow positive or neutral. When you're looking at Cedar, are you specifically looking at that as the equity contribution or are you looking at it as your proportional CapEx? Cameron Goldade We're looking at it as our equity contribution. Operator Your next question comes from Patrick Kenny of National Bank. Patrick Kenny Wondering if you had any thoughts on how the destination of TMX volumes plays out here, Asia versus California, and how this dynamic might create opportunities for your tankage footprint or perhaps blending operations whether at North 40, Base Line, [ Duvernay ], you name it. Just your general thoughts on opportunities across your system. Chris Scherman It's Chris. I think it's very difficult at this point for us to opine on where those volumes are going to end up, so we'll probably stay away from that one. But undoubtedly, there's some positive flow back into our business from that commerce going west, and I think it shows up to some degree in tanks as customers are trying to optimize flows east and west as well as they're trying to manage quality. So we definitely see a bit of a tailwind there and are optimistic about what it means for the basin more broadly, but certainly for our tankage in our business. Jaret Sprott Obviously, Pat, the #1 significant impact to Pembina long-term, and I'm going to talk about this a little bit more next week, is increased egress, it'll raise the price of the heavier oils here in western Canada. That should spur on incremental supply that will require condensate. Obviously, Pembina has a fairly large condensate business with respect to Peace and Cochin, so higher utilization and incremental expansions to get more condensate into the Edmonton market, which ultimately will head up into the new supply that's coming on. So that's really where Pembina significantly benefits. Patrick Kenny Maybe just on your hydrogen ammonia opportunity at Redwater, if I recall, I believe the FEED study was expected to be completed by now. So maybe just a status update there. And then curious too if you believe the sequestration economics for your customers can be underwritten solely by the proposed ITCs or if perhaps these economics are also contingent on mitigating the price of carbon through CFDs or otherwise.

Pat, it's Stu. I'll start. As you mentioned, we progressed our ammonia project. We're wrapping up the [ pre-FEED ] work. [ Mayor Ben] he's been a great partner to work with. We've progressed that study. It's a large amount of work. We have to look at the partnership, the capital structure, the capital for that project, look at the markets, the market timing, the Canadian government timing as well on things. And so we're continuing to progress that study and looking at the integration of all the pieces there. We're going to go and have further conversation with our partner in the coming weeks and see where we go with this project. It still is early days, and we're learning a lot as we go, and we're anticipating further information coming out from Asian governments as well as Canadian governments in the near future that will shed some light on the feasibility of the project itself. With respect to carbon pricing, we've done a lot of work on our ACG project. We're pretty pleased where we're sitting. We've completed our appraisal well. There's still some work, some downhole subsurface work that's going to be completed. We've got an infrastructure plan and a preliminary capital cost estimate for that. But there's no question on the carbon sequestration side. It comes down to we have a cost for the sequestration, our customers have a capture cost as well, and trying to find that balance of what can be afforded and what are the government policies on a go-forward basis from a pricing perspective and what's needed to support that project. And it's challenging at this point in time for, I think, many customers as the costs are not getting cheaper for carbon sequestration capture in particular. And so we're working through that with, again, our partner, TC Energy, and our various customers that we're having conversations with. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I would hand over the call to Scott Burrows, President and CEO, for closing comments. Please go ahead. J. Burrows Thanks, everyone. And thanks for taking the time to listen to us today. Again, just a friendly reminder of our AGM this afternoon and our Investor Day next week. And we look forward to seeing many of you there. Have a great weekend.

Good morning, and welcome to the Pembina Pipeline Corporation Q2 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Friday, August 9, 2024. Now let's turn the conference over to Dan Tucunel, Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Dan Tucunel Thank you, Joanna. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pembina's conference call and webcast to review highlights from the second quarter of 2024. On the call today we have Scott Burrows, President and Chief Executive Officer; Cameron Goldade, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; along with other members of Pembina's leadership team including Jaret Sprott, Janet Loduca, Stu Taylor, and Chris Scherman. I would like to remind you that some of the comments made today may be forward-looking in nature and are based on Pembina's current expectations, estimates, judgments, and projections. Forward-looking statements we may express or imply today are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further, some of the information provided refers to non-GAAP measures. To learn more about these forward- looking statements and non-GAAP measures, please see the company's MD&A dated August 8, 2024, for the period ended June 30, 2024, as well as the press release Pembina issued yesterday. All of these documents are available online at pembina.com and on both SEDAR and EDGAR. I will now turn things over to Scott to make some opening remarks. J. Burrows Thanks, Dan. Another strong quarter was highlighted by record adjusted EBITDA of $1.091 billion, record adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $837 million and direct adjusted cash flow per share of $1.44. Record results were driven in part by the closing of the Alliance, Aux Sable acquisition effective April 1 as Pembina benefited from increased ownership in those assets. Both Aux Sable and Alliance have been performing well, and we are excited to welcome new employees to the Pembina team.  󰍉 PPL 󰍝  3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 1/15

With the release of our second quarter results yesterday, we were also pleased to announce that we have acquired the remaining 14.6% interest in Aux Sable U.S. operations from Williams effective August 1. Since the Williams Aux Sable acquisition and the Aux Sable assets have been outperforming Pembina's expectations, and we are pleased to now have fully consolidated ownership of all Aux Sable assets, thereby further simplifying corporate reporting and enhancing the ability to pursue long-term opportunities. Pembina's business continues to deliver exceptional results. Volume growth across the Canadian energy industry is leading to higher volumes in our pipelines, gas plants, and fractionators. And while we would prefer to see higher natural gas prices for our producing customers, the current weakness along with robust NGL pricing and strong oil prices is leading to continued strength in Pembina's marketing business. Given the strong year-to-date results, the incremental benefit of the latest Aux Sable acquisition and our outlook for the remainder of the year, Pembina has raised its 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $4.2 billion to $4.35 billion, which at the midpoint, represents a $100 million increase over the previous range. Finally, the second quarter was further highlighted by 3 other exciting developments. The first was the positive final investment decision on the Cedar LNG project. We are excited to be moving forward with a project that will deliver industry-leading, low carbon, cost competitive Canadian LNG to overseas markets and contribute to global energy security while delivering jobs and economic prosperity to the local region. The Cedar LNG projects aligned squarely with Pembina's strategy, offers attractive economics, and is supported by a contracting strategy that prudently mitigates cost risk. The second was PGI's transaction with Whitecap Resources, which included the acquisition of a 50% interest in Whitecap's Kaybob Complex and an obligation to fund further Lator area infrastructure development. We also signed long-term take-or-pay agreements on Pembina's pipelines and fractionators. The deal is another example of PGI and Pembina's ability to provide unique and value-added solutions to support the growth demands of our customers. And the third was bringing the Phase VIII Peace Pipeline Expansion into service, marking a culmination of more than 10 years and more than $4 billion expansion program that was driven by growing customer demand for transportation services to support development in the WCSB, including the Montney, Duvernay, and other resource players. The Peace Pipeline system plays an important role within Pembina's integrated value chain, and I would like to thank our many customers, employees, and communities that have supported Pembina to deliver this major infrastructure build-out. As a result of the expansions and ongoing optimization efforts, Pembina is confident that its extensive pipeline network is best positioned to capture future volume growth and allow the company to continue to offer customers' unparalleled advantages through safe, reliable, flexible, and cost competitive services together with differentiated market access. I will now turn the call over to Cam to discuss highlights for our -- from our second quarter. Cameron Goldade Thanks, Scott. As Scott noted, Pembina reported a record second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.091 billion. This represents a 33% increase over the same period in the prior year and remaining a 21% increase adjusting for the Alliance, Aux Sable ownership. In pipelines, factors impacting the second quarter primarily included higher adjusted EBITDA from Alliance due to stronger asset performance combined with increased ownership following the Alliance, Aux Sable acquisition, 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 2/15

the Northern Pipeline system outage and wildfires in the second quarter of 2023, which had an impact of $29 million with no similar impact in the second quarter of 2024, contractual inflation adjustments on tolls and the earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue on the Peace Pipeline system, and the reactivation of the Nipisi pipeline in the third quarter of 2023. In facilities, factors impacting the second quarter included the inclusion within facilities of adjusted EBITDA from Aux Sable following the Alliance, Aux Sable acquisition, the Northern Pipeline system outage and wildfires in the second quarter of 2023, which had an impact of $18 million with no similar impacts in the second quarter of 2024, and higher interruptible volumes on certain PGI assets. In marketing and new ventures, second quarter results reflect the net impact of increased ownership interest in Aux Sable following the Alliance, Aux Sable acquisition as well as higher NGL margins at Aux Sable, higher margins from the Western Canadian NGL marketing business due to higher marketed volumes, lower natural gas prices and higher propane, butane, and condensate prices, realized losses on NGL-based derivatives compared to gains in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher realized gains on crude oil-based commodity- related derivatives as well as higher general and administrative expense. Finally, the Corporate segment was largely unchanged. Earnings in the second quarter were $479 million. This represents a 32% increase over the same period in the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, earnings in the second quarter were impacted by unrealized losses recognized by PGI on interest rate derivative financial instruments compared to gains in the second quarter of 2023, gains associated with the derecognition of the provisions related to the financial assurances provided by Pembina, which were transferred to Cedar LNG following the positive FID in June, larger unrealized losses on renewable power purchase agreements, and unrealized loss on NGL-based derivatives compared to an unrealized gain in the second quarter of 2023, higher depreciation and amortization, net finance costs, and acquisition and integration fees. Pipeline volumes of 2.7 million barrels per day in the second quarter represented an 11% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the increase in ownership interests in Alliance, higher volumes on the Peace Pipeline system resulting from earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue and the impact of the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires in the second quarter of 2023, combined with the reactivation of the Nipisi pipeline. Facilities volumes of approximately 0.9 million barrels per day in the second quarter represent a 14% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to Aux Sable volume recognition following the Alliance, Aux Sable acquisition, higher volumes at Younger as the second quarter of 2023 was impacted by the Northern Pipeline system outage and the wildfires, combined with higher interruptible volumes on certain PGI assets. Turning to our outlook for 2024. In addition to raising our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance, as Scott mentioned previously, Pembina has also revised its 2024 capital investment program to $1.3 billion. The revised outlook reflects an approximate $140 million net increase when compared to our original 2024 budget of $1.16 billion, inclusive of then unsanctioned additional growth capital. Drivers of the increase primarily includes the sanctioning of PGI's Wapiti expansion and K3 cogeneration facility, other increases in revenue-generating capital within pipelines, and additional nonrecoverable sustaining capital. The revised capital investment program reflects approximately $300 million for contributions to equity accounted investees, including $240 million of equity contributions to Cedar LNG incurred in the first half of 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 3/15

2024, with no further contributions to Cedar expected in 2024. Pembina continues to expect the capital program to be funded with cash flow from operating activities net of dividends, maintaining its strong balance sheet. At June 30, based on the trailing 12 months, the ratio of proportionally consolidated senior debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.6x, which is at the low end of our target range. It's important to note, however, that given the April 1 closing date of the Alliance, Aux Sable acquisition, the ratio includes all the debt associated with the transaction, but is currently only capturing one quarter of EBITDA contribution. On a normalized basis, this ratio will be approximately 3.3x. I'll now turn things back to Scott. J. Burrows Thanks, Cam. In closing, I'd like to reiterate that for all of us at Pembina, it has been a strong first half of 2024, and we are looking forward to continued strength throughout the remainder of the year. Amidst the backdrop of industry momentum and an expectation of robust volume growth, we continue to see increased utilization across our systems, pursue many opportunities to accretively invest capital and execute our strategy within our financial guardrails. Thank you for joining us this morning and for your continued support. Operator, please open the line up for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] your first question comes from Jeremy Tonet at JPMorgan Chase. Jeremy Tonet Just want to dial in on the acquisitions a little bit more Aux Sable, Alliance here. It seems like they're outperforming our expectations. I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit more, I guess, about the outperformance, and really curious about looking forward, I guess, it seems like full ownership would bring new opportunities to Pembina and how that kind of impacts, I guess, the marketing opportunities as well. Just any more color on how we should think about what's possible there going forward? J. Burrows Jeremy, a lot of the strength really was driven at the Aux Sable level. Obviously, the low gas price and high NGL prices had a strong impact on that business. As we pointed out in our comments, we'd obviously like a little higher gas price for all of our producing community and hopefully add to increased drilling. But in the short term here, that low gas price has really led to strong frac spreads across the business, especially at Aux Sable. When you go back to our acquisition presentation and thesis, we talked about some of the longer-term synergies more towards the end of the decade. And we think having full control of Aux Sable will allow us to continue to capture those and give us a leg up in terms of capturing those. It's a little too early to start talking about what exactly those are in terms of where we're headed, but we're actively working and planning on those today. Jeremy Tonet 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 4/15

And in the release, I think this language that highlights the expectations for 6% and 4% conventional and gas processing volume growth, respectively, in '24, I'm just wondering is this a similar trajectory you kind of see in the near term post '24 in general at a high level? And I guess my question is, if you're expecting kind of the mid- single-digit growth, is this filling latent capacity on the system? Or is this more capital intensity? Effectively, how much capital investment will be required to attain that kind of mid-single-digit growth mid-cycle as it could be possible? Jaret Sprott Jeremy, it's Jaret here. So first, I'll talk a little bit about what we're seeing kind of in 2024 with respect to our conventional volume growth, and then I'll touch on PGI just for a second. So you saw in our -- I think in our press release, we dropped it from roughly 9% to 6%. That really equates to approximately -- it's not that much material amount of volume, it's roughly 30,000 barrels. And what we did see in the first half of the year, which you'll probably recall from the previous quarters, was we saw a significant reduction in volumes in January here in Western Canada with some extreme weather. That obviously set a lot of our customers back, and they really didn't make that up. We saw a larger turnaround season kind of in that May, June than we expected from some of our third parties. All of the PGI turnarounds went as expected and the Phase VIII went -- that commissioning went extremely well. And then we had a short unplanned outage at our frac complex, specifically RFS 1, that restricted some C2+ volume. So that's a big portion of the overall reduction. And then the latter half of the year, across a couple of hundred receipt points in the conventional system, it's really just timing of development that we're seeing from our customers. It's not that they're not drilling in these liquid-rich areas, it's just that forecasting of when the volumes are coming on. That kind of leads into -- there's been some public disclosure recently around some drier gas either being shut in or not completed. We're not really seeing the effects of that. As you know, like the majority of our PGI assets -- or all of our PGI assets, they produce significantly liquids-rich gas. And you're actually seeing that in the overall revenue volume increase in PGI. I think we talked from 3% to 4%, 4% to 5%. We're seeing -- and we haven't brought on any new gas plants. So we're seeing really strong gas growth where we have the lots of condensate and lots of NGLs, which is extremely positive. And I think one of the features of our footprint is that we don't process a lot of the dryer gas. With all that said, our overall thesis for Western Canadian liquids growth hasn't really changed in that mid-digit. And as we think about latent capacity versus expanded capacity, when you're in Alberta kind of now that Phase VIII is in service, kind of Gordondale follow the map all the way down to Fox Creek into Edmonton, that's going to be kind of latent capacity use and/or pump station. No more linear assets required to get those volumes into the Edmonton market. And then as you go west of Gordondale into Northeast BC, that's where we'll require some incremental pipelines, et cetera. So that's kind of the distinction. And that's kind of all been built into our 3-year capital forecast in both part of our 3-year cash flow per share guidance that we gave at Investor Day. Anything else to add, Cam or Scott? Jeremy Tonet So maybe just, I guess, mid-cycle CapEx or near-term CapEx run rate levels, any high-level thoughts there? Is there more processing CapEx that's required to kind of hit that mid-single-digit growth? 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 5/15

Page 6
Cameron Goldade Jeremy, I think I'd sort of go back to our message from Investor Day, which was if you sort of look at this year, next year, we're probably running right around that free cash flow neutral level. So the levels that you're seeing in 2024-2025, it's somewhere in between that $1 billion to $1.25 billion range is probably the run rate for the next couple of years, assuming we continue to execute on the plan and the projects that Jaret outlined. As Jaret mentioned, obviously, a big part of that is obviously completing RFS IV, which comes into service in the first half of 2026. And likewise, as we continue to move forward and build out that Northeast BC capital, Northeast BC transportation capital that Jaret referred to, that will be in that same time frame as well, providing that all sort of goes ahead with that. And then once you get to sort of the 2026 time frame outward, obviously, the base core business capital starts to trail off as some of those assets come into service. Our BD teams are obviously very hard at work, and we continue to see opportunities. But for the next couple of years, I think that's probably the way we're thinking about it. Operator The next question comes from Praneeth Satish at Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish Maybe just on Cedar, if you can give us an update here in terms of reassigning the capacity that you hold with third parties? Are you seeing strong interest from customers there? What's the time line to announce that contract? And also, how committed are you to kind of reassigning that entire 1.5 mtpa and could you keep more of it and end up marketing more than 0.3 mtpa with your marketing group? Stuart Taylor It's Stu. So we're now following the FID announcement and progress. We are ramping up our marketing efforts, looking at the remaining capacity of Cedar. I will say that as our project became more real with the FID announcement, our interest is high. We've been working with a number of potential off-takers that we've had conversations for a long period of time, but we do have some renewed and new interest coming in as well. So we're excited and optimistic of progressing those conversations to completion with a target to have as much of that completed in 2024. So we're optimistic and excited and continue to make progress with potential offtakers. Praneeth Satish And maybe just switching gears and moving over to the Bakken. I have 2 questions here on the Vantage pipeline. First, if you can kind of remind us what the utilization is on the pipe and whether Vantage can be expanded any further with pumps? And then secondly, to the extent that there is excess capacity and it can be expanded at a low cost, can you satisfy all of your Dow ethane contract with Vantage? I guess what would the cost be of moving ethane on Vantage versus some of the other options that you're considering? 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 6/15

Page 7
J. Burrows Thanks for the question. So yes, we currently do have some white space on the Vantage pipeline that is capable, obviously, of bringing more ethane up into the [indiscernible] system and then into the petrochemical feedstock takers there in Western Canada. With respect to our portfolio, with respect to Dow, we're kind of taking a more diversified approach to this. So please think of it as ethane that comes out of our RFS complex, that is C2+ being extracted in Western Canada and then broken into its parts and fed into the crackers here. In Alberta, there is the C2 extraction component. That's more like mainline extraction like our Empress or Younger facilities that feed straight ethane into the system, into the crackers, and then you have the Vantage system that can bring product up from North Dakota. So across those kind of 3 portfolios. Right now, we're just evaluating what's the best use of capital to basically fulfill our entire Dow commitment. So we won't really specifically talk to where the majority of that capital is going to go right now. I think at Investor Day, we talked about here in the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to provide some more insight on where that capital will be going. But Vantage is definitely a part of the overall portfolio of consideration to meet that contract. Operator Next question comes from Patrick Kenny at National Bank Financial. Patrick Kenny Just maybe quickly on the Aux Sable or Alliance and Aux Sable consolidation. I know there's some accounting noise in there, but maybe you can just walk us through the headline, $600 million loss on disposal of your equity interest and maybe what that means for your corporate effective tax rate going forward? Cameron Goldade Patrick, it's Cam here. You just made our accounting teams day with the question. It's not a really straightforward explanation other than to say that the accounting standards are pretty clear about how you have to treat a step acquisition. You basically have to act as if you've disposed what you've got as the equity accounted investment and then realize the entire fair value acquisition like you would any other acquisition. So obviously, you do the fair value on the existing interest and mark that to market. Obviously, I think what's important in recognizing that accounting is that there's an offsetting deferred tax recovery on that derecognition, which effectively nets you to about 0 or so. It's about a $9 million gain when you net those 2 out. And then obviously, then you go forward and you consolidate. And then with the consolidation now, obviously, we own 100% of Alliance and now 100% of Aux Sable. But in Q2, obviously, there was a small nonconsolidated interest on Aux Sable, which just gets netted out at the back end. Patrick Kenny And then, I guess, going forward, just any impact positively or negatively on the effective tax rate? J. Burrows 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 7/15

Page 8
Yes. I think there will be some positive effect on the effective tax rate. As you've seen that there is some benefit to the acquisition, potentially the larger acquisition as a result of some opportunities in the U.S. And so we do get a benefit there. And I think that shows up in terms of the updated tax guidance. So you'll see it come down ever so slightly. Patrick Kenny And then maybe just on the cost pressures here you're experiencing on RFS IV, maybe you can just walk us through some of the scope changes that might be embedded in that new budget? And then also, just given construction activity really picking up here for large-scale projects in the Heartland area, just how we should be thinking about your ability to lock in costs from a labor productivity standpoint? Jaret Sprott Great question, Pat. So think of the project increase kind of in the following 3 buckets. The first bucket being the project changes and design modifications. This is really to enhance the overall operability of RFS IV specifically and the overall complex. As you know that we can spread molecules to any one of the fracs. And it's specifically to accommodate a wider range of C3+ feedstock composition. So depending on where you're customer, if your customer is extracting NGLs from a Deep Basin well versus a very oily Montney well, you get a wide range of NGL composition. So this -- we made a decision just to enhance the overall operability to have a wider range to take that product composition. The second bucket is we saw some incremental inflation over and above what we expected in the latter half of '23 when obviously there was a very large project sanctioned in Alberta here. So that was unexpected and caused some of the increase. And then the third bucket is our decision, when we sanctioned this project in February of 2023, it was going to be a typical Pembina project where we do all of the oversight and the execution. And as we saw these labor concerns, as you identified, the Heartland area getting busy, we decided to move to a lump sum to make sure that we could procure a Tier 1 contractor that we were confident could get the fabrication shop space, make sure they had access to high-quality labor, make sure that they were going to execute with respect to our safety expectations and values and indigenous content and deliver high-quality project on time. So we've shifted roughly 70% of that total project as we stated to a lump sum. We'll execute on more of that outside the lease boundary, outside the frac area, we'll do a lot of that execution. But we have made that shift, and we did see with shifting that risk from yourself to a third party who's going to deliver that high-quality labor and safety expectation, there is a little bit of a cost with that. So that's kind of how we break up those 3 buckets. And overall, the project, like we said, is still planned on being delivered on time, which is great. And then with respect to the commercial side, with this project coming out of the ground as we speak, we've been able to secure incremental contracts at the overall base complex, RFS 1, II and III, which is obviously a great way for business. And then we've secured a lot of new contracts over and above our original base case when we sanction this with the Board in February of 2023. And with the incremental cost, we have seen that the overall sanctioned metrics have actually gone up. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 8/15

And then with respect to the overall portfolio, I'll just talk like the heartland is seeing a little bit of increase. But overall, our portfolio is still of projects, it's still industry-leading, and we have the full confidence in our team to continue with the current projects to deliver on time, on budget and the future ones. Patrick Kenny And maybe just real quick where the incremental costs you've contemplated when -- with the PGI Whitecap transaction as well? In other words, like the all-in economics of the deal, I know some of it has some downstream benefits embedded in the returns. Just wondering if those returns are still in line with your expectations with the new costs on RFS IV? Jaret Sprott Absolutely. Yes. Operator Next question comes from Rob Hope at Scotiabank. Robert Hope I want to follow up on the frac discussion. I guess 2 parts there. First one is, are the incremental contracts that you signed on for the entire RFS complex reflective of the incremental capital for RFS IV? And then how much white space do you have at RFS? And kind of when could you need some incremental capacity beyond what you're building? Jaret Sprott There's limited white space, Rob, at the complex and even with RFS IV coming into service. So right now, very focused on project execution of Step 1 with respect to the execution teams. But obviously, the commercial teams are in constant conversations with our other customers. And it's a balancing act between ensuring that we have the base load of the first 3 fracs long-term contract extensions filled for under long-term deals and then they get focused on sanctioning number 5. But right now, it's really focused on number 4 and getting that customer interaction for 5 going. I'd say that's a little bit further out. With respect to your first question, I think you were asking about incremental contracts, like has anything changed specific due to the cost increase. Is that accurate? Robert Hope Yes, like are the incremental -- where fees adjusted up for the new capital costs, and that's how returns were put back on site. Jaret Sprott 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 9/15

Page 10
Yes. It's a combination of -- specifically, it's a combination of volume fees and then you also have the downstream ancillary fees, such as rail loading and terminaling, et cetera. And then obviously, the marketing business as well. Some customers choose Pembina to do their full suite of marketing and some customers obviously do their own marketing, but we are advancing a lot of that business. And then you're obviously seeing the upside through the marketing arm as well. Robert Hope And then maybe just switching over to the ethane opportunities that were highlighted at the Investor Day, how are those progressing? And then just given the -- well call it -- a tightening labor market in the Heartland, could this deemphasize an RFS III DS and kind of focus more out in the field? Jaret Sprott I would say no right now, Rob, because that's a -- that's a fairly small project, as we've stated before, RFS III, and we just really need the tower. So it's not an extensive like it's not 500 people on site, and it's building a few pieces of equipment and some select fab shops. So you might see a little bit of cost pressure there, but I don't think that would be enough to deter us away from looking at that project. But since Investor Day, we have accelerated a handful of projects through Gate 1 funding. So that's small dollar amounts to get pre-feed kicked off, and then we'll be evaluating that near in the upcoming couple of quarters and making a decision on which projects go through Gate 2 and ultimately Gate 3 and which ones won't be? J. Burrows I think, Rob, we'll be able to understand kind of what current labor costs and what current costs are, which will help guide us in terms of which decision we make, which is, as Jaret pointed out previously, one of the advantages we have is we do have numerous sources that we can source the ethane from. And so any updated capital cost will go into that mix and our decision making. Operator The next question comes from Robert Catellier from CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier You've answered most of my questions by this point. But I just wondered given the massive development of the Peace System over the last several years, what's your vision for developing it from here? What further optimizations are possible from this point? J. Burrows So, Rob, I think there's a few different things. And again, this question, given the breadth of the system really depends on where the volumes show up. And so when you're in Alberta, for the most part, we will focus on optimization now that we have segregated lines and where can we use pump optimization, product optimization to increase throughput. We've already found some wins across the system to unlock some incremental volumes. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 10/15

Page 11
We do have other areas where we can add low-cost pumps like from Fox Creek in to increase volumes there. And then we'll continue to look at opportunities in Northeast BC as LNG comes on -- LNG Phase I and other opportunities come online and we see incremental growth there. So it's a tough question to answer. There are certain areas that are tight where we'll have to expand, and there are certain areas where we have utilization opportunities. Robert Catellier And I'm just wondering what the thought is on the frac spread hedging in light of both the current prices and your increased exposure now that you've consolidated Aux. J. Burrows So, Rob, we have a pretty programmatic hedging program based on where frac spreads are in terms of -- from a statistical basis, P10 to P90 with very limited discretion as it relates to the hedging program. One of the benefits we did talk about on the original Aux Sable acquisition as well as with the new contract as it made it a lot simpler to hedge. And so as we stand today, we're about 50% hedged in Canada, and we actually have about just under 50% of Aux Sable hedged for 2024 as well. Based on how frac spreads have trended the forward curve, we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% hedged for 2025, but we'll likely be locking in incremental hedges just given where forward frac spreads are compared to, I'll call it, the 5 to 10-year historical average. Robert Catellier And last question, just a clarification from Cam. I think I understood from your previous discussion of taxes that the $24 million current tax has not materially changed despite the increased marketing guidance. Is that correct? Cameron Goldade That's correct, Robert. Operator The next question comes from Ben Pham at BMO. Benjamin Pham Can you guys talk about the M&A opportunities in Western Canada? Do you expect more of the Whitecap JV to restructure this? Do you think PE firms will be looking to monetize or even strategic looking to dispose of assets? J. Burrows Ben, it's a really hard thing to predict. I mean we couldn't have predicted that the Whitecap transaction was going to happen 6, 7 months ago. So I don't know. We're not seeing necessarily a lot right now, and there's still a fair 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 11/15

Page 12
number of producers that want to own that infrastructure. So it's very producer specific. But we're certainly -- we don't have line of sight to a large M&A pipeline. And then as it relates to PE firms, again, I can't really speculate. It still feels like a lot of the assets are relatively in their kind of early fund life. So we don't see anything that's kind of being driven by fund life. So I don't have a good insight now as to what PE firms may or may not be doing. Benjamin Pham And I know there are some comments on Alliance, Aux exceeding expectations and then the tuck-in of Aux to maybe sort of applying these synergies a bit. Is that comment more suggesting that you might beat that 8x multiple that you've commented about? And then what about that acceleration of the marketing volumes? Has that changed now? J. Burrows Yes. Ben, I guess, I would just say that I think, obviously, as Scott mentioned earlier, we've been fortunate in the sense that, obviously, the commodity complex has strengthened since we made the original acquisition and continues to show strength in this year and even looking next year. In terms of the synergies, I think it does -- I mean any time you've got sort of full control of an asset, it obviously does put the wheel squarely in your hands to execute on those synergies. So I think it does support us in that regard. And I do believe that we will see additional opportunities as we sort of get our arms wrapped around and sort of keep moving things forward as we've done with other assets. Are we at a point yet where we're ready to put our hand in the fire and start to quantify those? Not yet, but I think we're definitely seeing things evolve positively. And so far, very pleased with the acquisition, the timing and the returns that it's generating. Operator Next question comes from Robert Kwan at RBC Capital Markets. Robert Kwan I can start with guidance and just some of the thinking around the asymmetric increase. And just is that just more of conservatism on the high end, whether it's around some of the volumes that Jaret talked about earlier or maybe potentially anything you see on the rail side of things versus the low end coming up and just the confidence you've got with some -- well, just the mechanical changes with the Aux Sable acquisition and the like? Jaret Sprott Yes. I think that's a fair comment, Rob. And as you suggest, I mean, there's a number of things that go into it. I think we obviously had confidence to bring the low end up meaningfully from where it was last time just based on such a strong first half. When we're looking at the second half of the year, I mean, there's a couple of things, obviously, that are coming into effect, which some with certainty, some with less certainty. And so obviously, as we look forward to the second half of 2024, we've got the [indiscernible] firm tolls are now under the revised 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 12/15

Page 13
tolling structure. The -- while we continue to see strength at the moment, obviously, when you sort of look out in terms of interruptible flows through Q3 on Alliance, some uncertainty there could exceed our expectations. But obviously, taking sort of what we know at the moment. And then lastly, clearly, the big outstanding item or range is obviously the marketing book and how that shapes up. Obviously, some backwardation in the crude market here. This forward strip currently shows some strength in the gas market as we close out the year. But those are all uncertain. And so as we look at that -- and then on top of it, as you point out, a couple of things which are outside of our control. You've got a rail issue. We're hopefully coming towards the tail end of wildfires in Alberta and Western Canada for the year, but that obviously always remains a risk through the summer here. So a few things on our mind that we bake in there. And obviously, we want additional strength by bringing up the bottom end and obviously bringing up the top end as well, but recognizing the uncertainty in the back end of the year. J. Burrows Yes. The only thing I'd add, Rob, too, is just given we don't control the closing of Whitecap, none of that transaction is in that outlook. Robert Kwan If I can just turn to the RFS IV costs and really just how do you think about the parallels, if any, or lack of parallels, I guess, with that versus what you're seeing from Cedar -- and one thing just to touch on is I think Cedar had some off-site fabrication. And so is that going to put pressure on that component at a minimum on the project? J. Burrows None. None, Rob. Cedar, we had the lump sum at the time we press release. So that's all reflected in the cost and all the fabrications being done in overseas is not really anything in the fort. So we see zero parallels between the 2. Robert Kwan And then just the last, just on the Whitecap deal, can you just talk about within PGI -- you've got kind of the return that makes sense for the joint venture -- how do you think about the upside you can get from all of the other pieces? I don't know if you want to quantify it, but just what are the different pieces that give you that upside? And specifically, can you just comment on the Musreau ethane angle under the Dow contract? Jaret Sprott So downstream, so obviously, there's the base acquisition of the Kaybob facility through PGI. And then there's the capitalization of the Lator battery that Whitecap will be executing that, and then we'll be executing the pipeline to tie into Musreau. So really filling white space through our K3 facility as we connect that to the Kaybob facility down into the Southeast. And then when you go west, right, maximizing the utilization of our original Cutbank Complex or Musreau complex, as we call it. And then ultimately, we have the opportunity to take more of that 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1887480343&ts=3236712&ref=l6cin7 13/15

Page 14
more gas through the deep cut at Musreau. So obviously, that ethane can be part of our overall diversification portfolio to satisfy our Dow contract. And then obviously, you have current liquids that are extracted at K3 and the Kaybob facility. And then with incremental gas going through the Kaybob facility, obviously, there's incremental contracts required on through Peace and through the fractionator and then ultimately through the back end of the frac like terminaling and rail, et cetera. And then when you shift over to Lator, all of the incremental condensate will flow on the Peace System, the incremental C3+ that will be extracted from the gas and the C2 will obviously slow down the Peace System and all of those barrels. The condensate will be guided to various condensate outlets in Edmonton and the NGLs will go through the RFS complex. So that's kind of in totality how the deal -- the entire deal works, base extensions on contracts and then new incremental volumes through the value chain. Robert Kwan Could you see the magnitude of the step-up side of the CGI approaching the magnitude in terms of contribution of the acquired assets or… J. Burrows Rob, I'm sorry. I'm just not sure what the -- how to -- like what -- can you rephrase the question? Maybe I think we're just a little… Robert Kwan Yes. Like you talked about -- I don't know, maybe you can put it kind of in the build multiple or acquisition multiple contracts, presumably what you did within the joint venture as to stand-alone. So how much more of a kicker are you going to get from all the stuff that you would get downstream? J. Burrows Yes. I mean that obviously would disclose confidential information that I just don't think we can disclose at this stage. I mean I think suffice to say Jaret tried to highlight the fact that in addition to the standalone PGI returns, we secured incremental utilization of our facilities through existing and expanded contracts. So I think we've said what we needed to say on the actual acquisition release, and then upon close, we'll update 2025. But overall, we found the consolidated multiple in line with previous acquisitions, if not slightly better. Operator We have no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Scott Burrows for closing comments. J. Burrows Well, thank you and especially thanks to the analysts who I know have had a busy 2 weeks, and we're at the tail end here. So I appreciate all the questions and the quality notes last night.

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Wednesday, November 6, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Tucunel, VP of Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Dan Tucunel Thank you, Joanna. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pembina's conference call and webcast to review highlights from the third quarter of 2024. On the call today, we have Scott Burrows, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cameron Goldade, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; along with other members of Pembina's Senior Officer leadership team, including Jaret Sprott, Janet Loduca, Stu Taylor, Chris Scherman and Eva Bishop. I would like to remind you that some of the comments made today may be forward-looking in nature and are based on Pembina's current expectations, estimates, judgments and projections. Forward-looking statements we may express or imply today are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

Canadian Sedimentary Basin and a strong contribution from the marketing business. As Cam will discuss further in a moment, we have narrowed our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $25 million on either end to $4.225 billion to $4.325 billion. In addition to solid financial results, the third quarter was highlighted by 3 notable transactions. The first was the acquisition of the remaining 14.6% interest in Aux Sable's U.S. operations, resulting in fully consolidated ownership of all the Aux Sable assets. This transaction allows further simplification of our corporate reporting and enhances our long-term service offering from the Aux Sable assets. In addition, PGI, jointly owned by Pembina and KKR, entered into 2 exciting transaction with growth-focused companies operating in the Montney and Duvernay. The first transaction with Whitecap included the acquisition of a 50% interest in Whitecap's Kaybob complex and an obligation to fund future Lator area infrastructure development. Further, the second transaction, PGI entered into agreements with Veren that included the acquisition of Veren's Gold Creek and Karr area oil batteries and support for future infrastructure development. We are pleased to have closed this transaction effective October 9, 2024, and look forward to growing alongside Veren in the years to come. Under the agreement with Veren, PGI is committed to fund up to $300 million of future infrastructure and we are pleased to be progressing in new battery and associated pipelines, representing more than half of the funding commitment. More details will be provided upon completion of upcoming engineering milestones. Through these 2 transactions, we are realizing the vision set for with the creation of PGI in 2022. We were successful with Whitecap and Veren because we have a unique ability to provide tailored and value-added solutions to support the specific needs of our customers. The opportunities arising from the creation of PGI have attractive economics and are expected to enhance asset utilization, enable future volume capture and benefit Pembina's full value chain. We also continue to progress our various major projects. Portions of the Northeast BC midpoint pump station expansion have been completed. We are on track to be fully complete by year-end. Notably, that project is trending under its $90 million budget. And while a smaller project, it is another example of Pembina's strong project execution. As well, we continue to advance further expansions to support volume growth in the Northeast BC and are pleased that the CER has determined our application for the Taylor to Gordondale expansion is complete and we can proceed to the assessment phase. At our RFS IV expansion, site clearing activities have been completed, while engineering and procurement activities and site construction continue. Finally, the Cedar LNG project, we reached an exciting early milestone with the start of onshore construction activities, including site clearing and other civil works. Detailed engineering is underway on the floating LNG facility, and we are looking forward to the start of construction in mid-2025. I'll now turn things over to Cam discuss in more detail the financial highlights for the third quarter. Cameron Goldade Thanks, Scott. As Scott noted, Pembina reported record third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.019 billion, consistent with the same period in the prior year. While results were essentially flat period-over-period, we saw strong performance across most of Pembina's business primarily from the positive impacts of increased 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 2/14

ownership of Alliance and Aux Sable, combined with growing volumes on certain systems and higher NGL margins. However, these results were offset by headwinds we faced on one specific asset, Cochin pipeline, and the combined impacts of various onetime and transitory events that impacted either the current quarter or the prior period. In pipelines, factors impacting the third quarter variance primarily included a higher contribution from Alliance due to increased ownership following the Alliance and Aux Sable acquisition, higher contribution from Alliance due to higher demand on seasonal contracts and the reactivation of the Nipisi pipeline in late 2023. These positive impacts were offset by a lower contribution from Cochin pipeline, primarily due to lower tolls on new long-term contracts, lower volumes resulting from a contracting gap from mid-July to August 1 associated with the return of line filter to certain customers, lower interruptible demand resulting from narrower condensate price differential between Western Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast and higher integrity spending and lower net revenue on the Peace Pipeline system due to the earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023, which more than offset higher contract volumes. In facilities, factors impacting the third quarter variance included the inclusion within facilities of adjusted EBITDA from Aux Sable following the Alliance-Aux Sable acquisition partially offset by a gain on the recognition of a finance lease in the third quarter of the prior year. In Marketing and new ventures, the third quarter variance reflected the net impact of higher net revenue from contracts with customers due to increased ownership interest in Aux Sable following the Alliance-Aux Sable acquisition and higher NGL margins. These positive impacts were offset by the impact of a 90-day unplanned outage at Aux Sable and lower realized gains on commodity-related derivatives. Finally, the third quarter corporate segment results reflect higher long-term incentive costs driven by Pembina's share price performance, partially offset by lower consulting costs. Earnings in the third quarter were $385 million. This represents an 11% increase over the same period in the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, earnings in the third quarter were impacted by unrealized losses recognized by PGI on interest rate derivative financial instruments due to falling interest rates compared to gains in the third quarter of the prior year, unrealized losses recognized by Cedar LNG on interest rate derivative financial instruments, unrealized gains on NGL-based derivatives and crude oil-based derivatives compared to unrealized losses in the third quarter of the prior year, larger unrealized losses on renewable power purchase agreements, a cost recovery related to a storage insurance settlement and higher depreciation and amortization expense and net finance costs. Pipeline volumes of 2.7 million barrels per day in the third quarter represent a 6% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the increased ownership interest in Alliance and the reactivation of the Nipisi pipeline. These factors were partially offset by lower volumes on Cochin Pipeline, the Drayton Valley Pipeline and the Peace Pipeline system. Lower volumes on the Peace Pipeline system were a result of earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023, which more than offset higher contracted volumes. If you normalize conventional pipeline volumes for the earlier take-or-pay recognition and outages, volumes were up approximately 2% over the prior period. Facilities volumes of approximately 800 million barrels per day in the third quarter represent a 1% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the Alliance and Aux Sable acquisition, lower volumes at the Redwater complex and at Younger and lower volumes on certain PGI assets due to the earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue in the first half of 2024 compared to the prior year, which more than offset higher PGI interruptible volumes. 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 3/14

Turning to our outlook for the full year. Pembina has narrowed its 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $4.225 billion to $4.325 billion. Further, we are currently trending towards the midpoint of the guidance range based on prevailing forward commodity prices and the outlook for fourth quarter volumes. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, conventional pipeline volumes have been modestly impacted by various Pembina and third- party outages and lower-than-expected interruptible volumes on certain systems, leading to a slightly moderated volume growth in 2024 than originally expected. However, the broader outlook for growth in the WCSB and Pembina's business remains strong, and the revised guidance is based on an expectation for the fourth quarter of higher interruptible volumes on certain systems and the impact of new contracts. At September 30, based on the trailing 12 months, the ratio of proportionally consolidated debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.6x, which is at the low end of the target range. It's important to note, however, that given the April 1 closing date of the Alliance and Aux Sable acquisition, the ratio includes all of the debt associated with the transaction that is currently only capturing 2 quarters of EBITDA contribution. On a normalized basis, this ratio would be approximately 3.4x. I'll now turn things back to Scott. J. Burrows Thanks, Cam. The first 3 quarters of 2024 has been tremendously exciting, highlighted by acquisitions and major project announcements as well as the continued momentum from industry-wide growth catalysts including the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, the near start-up of LNG Canada, new petrochemical facilities and new or expanded LPG export capacity. As we work hard to close out the year strongly, our attention is also turned to 2025 and beyond and how Pembina can continue to capitalize on the opportunities arising from this growth and deliver long-term and sustainable value for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, please go ahead and open up the line for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeremy Tonet at JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet I just want to start off with the conventional segment, if I could. I think you had mentioned 2% period-over-period growth there. I think in some of the market, maybe we're expecting a little bit higher growth there. Just wondering if you could touch on a bit more dynamics as you see it there and the outlook into '25 and the potential for mid- single-digit growth, I guess, based on your producer-customer conversations. J. Burrows Yes, I'll let Cam clarify the 2% comment. When we look out towards the end of the year, we're still looking at kind of a 4% exit-to-exit growth rate on the conventional system. Again, the second -- or the third quarter was impacted by Pembina and third-party turnarounds. But as we look forward to Q4, we're also seeing third-party facilities come online. So that 4% within that has some embedded growth from third-party facilities coming online, Jeremy. 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 4/14

And then as we look out towards 2025, we're still finalizing our 2025 budget and we'll have more to say in December, but we're still feeling confident in that 4% to 6% physical volume growth rate in 2025. And we're seeing that today in October. Volumes in October were quite strong compared to September. Now some of that is new growth. Some of that is just normalized operations and those volumes returning to the system. So that's kind of more of the bigger picture. Cam, do you want to just clarify your 2% comment? Cameron Goldade Yes, sure. Jeremy, just to clarify the 2% comment in my prepared remarks. If you sort of look at Q3 over Q3, the take-or-pay recognition and the outages collectively were worth a little under 60,000 barrels a day of impact there. So that gets you to the 2% when you normalize for that. Obviously, looking forward, Scott explained that well how we see that in excess of 2%. Jeremy Tonet Got it. Okay. So maybe some kind of turnaround noise in the quarter, but I guess, your longer-term outlook unchanged for mid-single-digit growth, if I got that correctly. J. Burrows Correct. Jeremy Tonet And then maybe just pivoting over to Alliance now, having full ownership of the asset. If you could talk a bit more, I guess, as far as your outlook for what you can do there, how you can better optimize over time as legacy contracts roll? And could there be growth in the Bakken or otherwise? Just wondering what's possible at this point. Jaret Sprott Jeremy, it's Jaret here. Yes. So integration continues to go extremely well, not only with the Alliance asset, but on the Aux Sable asset as well. And then when we -- looking at the synergies, those also were going as planned, kind of the shorter-term synergies. Longer term, what we're hearing from our shippers and potential shippers is they continue to value the service offering. They very much like the high reliability that the asset provides to the shippers here in Western Canada and the Bakken. And demand for the asset remains extremely high. We are engaged, obviously, with our shippers, talking to them about how we can meet incremental demands either full path or other opportunities, either out of the Bakken into the Chicago land area or maybe some interprovincial opportunities into Fort Saskatchewan or where other demand for gas is required. So just kind of working through those right now, but very encouraged with the conversations and just really trying to understand where the shippers want their gas to go and how we can unlock that value for them. 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 5/14

Operator The next question comes from Praneeth Satish at Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish Maybe turning to Cedar. Given the agreement, the existing contract that you have with ARC there was secured prior to the start of construction and with construction at least partly underway now. I assume that the risk profile for Cedar has decreased. So should we think about future offtake contracts that you signed on Cedar carrying a higher rate to reflect that there's lower risk on the project now? J. Burrows I think the interesting point is upon FID of Cedar, the interest in the project has increased, just given that it's real in people's eyes now versus prior to FID, I think people were waiting to see that decision. So I think between the FID decision as well as continued progress on the CGL expansion. People have more confidence in the project in the in-service date, the profile of that. And what that's led to is increased interest. And with that increased interest, we do believe, that coupled with the fact that this will be a scarce resource in terms of some of the only uncontracted LNG capacity off the West Coast of Canada that it should garner a premium. So that's certainly something that we're thinking about. We have term sheets out in front of potential off-takers, and we are in discussions. As we noted in the press release, we expect those to continue into early 2025, but we are having good discussions. Praneeth Satish Got it. And then on M&A, you've been active on the M&A front in recent quarters, especially at PGI but we've seen midstream valuations move higher over the past few months. Can you maybe help us understand how the bid- ask spread has evolved? Are you seeing actionable opportunities at reasonable multiples that meet your return thresholds? Or is it getting harder to find accretive deals? J. Burrows I think given the transactions we did in 2024, we're focused right now on closing and integrating the acquisitions. We're not out actively pursuing M&A opportunities. We'll always look at something if it comes for sale. We don't control the timing. So I'd say we're in a reactive mode, not proactive mode. Just because we have enough on our plate to integrate and capture the value from the previous acquisitions. Operator The next question comes from Rob Hope at Scotiabank. Robert Hope Just one question for me. Can you give us an update on the ethane opportunities as you move through the year? Are these increasingly clear and -- to get a better definition of the next phase of opportunities? 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 6/14

Page 7
Jaret Sprott Jaret here. You were kind of breaking up, but I just want to repeat, you were talking about the ethane opportunities, I think, with respect to probably our Dow supply agreement. Unfortunately, it's a little bit more of the same story. We continue just to evaluate the entire portfolio of our ethane supply. We have kicked off what we call internally Gate 0 and Gate 1 funding to progress engineering pre-feed work and those types of things on various opportunities. And 2025 -- in the first half of 2025 is where we'll sit down as a management team and really go for those opportunities and start to progress which ones will go through Gate 2 and Gate 3. So you'll see a little bit more probably in the latter half of '25. And then the majority of that capital, obviously, in 2025 will be spent in that engineering and pre-feed phase. '26, '27 when those assets come on stream is where you'll see the majority of that capital being deployed, bringing assets out of the ground. Operator The next question comes from Maurice Choy at RBC Capital Markets. Maurice Choy If I could just come back to Cedar LNG, I think you mentioned that there has been increased interest from the offtaker perspective and an update might come instead in early 2025. Obviously, these are complex discussions and do take time, but could you elaborate a little bit on how the discussions have generally evolved over recent months, be that in terms of the terms, the conditions, the volumes sort of in the competitive tension amongst the potential counterparties? Stuart Taylor It's Stu. So our conversations continued, have been ongoing for the past year. We've regrouped and looked at, as Scott described, the opportunity, the derisking of the opportunity and have picked up conversations with NOCs and IOCs who we were talking to previously. We've added additional counterparts in those conversations. Term sheets are out to those parties. At the same time, we've been conversation -- we're in conversations with Canadian producers and the opportunity of Cedar perhaps being an outlet for natural gas on a go-forward basis. So we've been pushing those conversations looking to get these term sheets out to people, both parties now have -- all the parties have term sheets and those term sheets are reflective of similar terms that were in the ARC arrangement, but with some minor changes that have been warranted. And it's an iterative process and we'll be having further conversations in 2024. And as described, we'll be looking to close on those conversations in '25. Maurice Choy Got it. And if I could just switch over to a comment earlier about interruptible volumes on certain systems. I think the guidance includes some recovery of these volumes in Q4 and could you just elaborate a little bit more about these volumes and how sustainable these are beyond the quarter. Jaret Sprott 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 7/14

Exactly like what Scott was saying, seeing stronger physical volumes and revenue volumes into the fourth quarter. The IT barrel, we do outlook components of that. And it's really around depending on which customer is really ramping up and how quickly they're ramping up that brings an IT barrel, but we are anticipating, obviously, a bit of a rebound into the quarter in Q4 with respect to that segment. Operator The next question comes from Robert Catellier from CIBC. Robert Catellier Maybe I can start with a higher level issue here. I'm curious what you think PPC election result and changes at the Blueberry River First Nation mean for your growth plans in BC. Janet Loduca This is Janet. With the NDP continuing to lead the government, then we actually see a smooth transition. We've been working closely with the folks in the BC government with the Blueberry River First Nation and others. And we think this will be, again, just a smooth transition and the continued effort to continue to implement the agreement between the 2 parties. Robert Catellier Okay. And maybe a question for Cam. I'm curious what you see as the sensitivity in your guidance to the work stoppage at the West Coast ports, how significant is that to your Q4 results? Jaret Sprott Rob, it's fairly minimal. Right now, we had the work stoppage previously. I can't remember exactly when that was, maybe last year. But it is somewhat immaterial to our Q4 outlook. Robert Catellier Okay. And then lastly, how are you seeing development change in the Duvernay given that there's been some recent turnover in some of the key lands there? Jaret Sprott Once again, Jaret here. We see that recent transaction upon closing as being extremely positive. Obviously, the potential acquirer is a very prudent and technical savvy producer. The previous owner, we had a wonderful relationship with Chevron and continue to have so. But they were typically only allocating 1, 1.5 rigs on a calendar year basis. And we've had some early conversations with Canadian Natural Resources just kind of outlining at high level how the contract works. And we're really excited about their understanding of the resource and kind of 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 8/14

Page 9
their get up and go to get after it and probably allocate more drilling rigs to the space. So we're expecting to see some higher utilizations in the future, that's for sure. We're excited. Operator The next question comes from Ben Pham at BMO. Benjamin Pham Just a couple of questions on the Cochin new contract. Can you comment on how the new toll compares to your original underwriting assumptions? And can you also talk about just maybe top-down key factors that were driving the renegotiations? Cameron Goldade Yes. Sure. Ben, it's Cam here. I'll take the first part. So I think, obviously, when you look at the variance that we saw in Q3, in the sort of period-over-period, I mean there's a handful of things as we outlined in the disclosure that contributed to that. Obviously, the new toll framework, the revised firm polls, that is about a $20 million a quarter impact and, obviously, the biggest single piece of the variance quarter-over-quarter. We talked about, obviously, this nuance in the contract where with the foundational shippers on the initial term having provided line fill, we were required to return the line fill to them and effectively, they shipped under that for that period in July. That was -- that along with the incremental integrity work for the quarter was about another sort of $12 million to $14 million impact. And we'd obviously characterize those as unusual or onetime events. And then lastly, the IT revenue portion in the quarter was affected by both the combination of the spreads, which are a consistent driver but also we had a temporary outage of 1 tank associated with that asset, which put a natural limit on the ability to move interruptible volumes. That really took up the balance of the variance. And so as we look forward to that asset, I think we're obviously happy to have it recontracted. I'll let Jaret speak to the dynamics of that exercise. But obviously, we see something that would exclude those onetime or extraneous events as we look forward. Jaret Sprott Yes. Just on the contract, obviously, our macro view of condensate demand in Western Canada is very strong, be it from the Chicago land area, the Gulf Coast, through Cochin Southern Lights or -- and obviously, the domestic supply here from Western Canada. So looking at those dynamics, and then recall when we took over this asset, the asset, I'm going to use some round numbers here, could do roughly 90,000 barrels a day of throughput. Since then, we've taken that over and -- our technical services teams have applied their expertise. And we can ratably do significantly more than 100,000 barrels a day. So taking that into consideration that we have more white space to offer for IT when spreads are strong, the overall macro view that demand is strong for the asset, looking at our customers on the oil sands side and the buyers in Edmonton. And just working through, we haven't talked about the tenure of the contracts and obviously, longer-term contracts with specific counterparties we can offer a little bit of a total discount in exchange for those longer-term contracts. So when you take all of those into consideration, we're pleased with the contracts that we executed and the counterparties in which we executed them with. And we have that incremental white 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 9/14

Page 10
space today with us expanding capacity that we can go out to the market and sell on a little bit of a shorter-term basis. And we believe overall long-term, the spreads will support us having the asset full on a physical basis every day. And yes, overall, happy with our acquisition and where we've recontracted it at. Cameron Goldade And sorry, just for a moment. I think on Cochin, one thing I should close out by saying is it's important to remember that when we acquired that asset originally, it was flowing about 85,000 to 90,000 BOE a day and through the work that we've done great work by the operations team. We've obviously increased the capacity of that asset, provide more egress and more access to condensate for our customers and obviously, more opportunities for Pembina. So we've grown that capacity meaningfully in terms of that size. Capacity is obviously well north of 100,000 barrels a day today. Someday closer to 110,000 or 115,000. So that's obviously helped to support the underwriting thesis from the original acquisition. Benjamin Pham Okay. I got it. So we should really look at not just -- I obviously, look at quarter-over-quarter, but also look at the initial volumes. That's good. And then I know no comment on tenor, but once it's up for renewal again. And Cochin technically be converted to oil pipeline or reverse or that's not even in the cards at all longer term? Jaret Sprott No, I think the demand for condensate imports and the supply for the oil sands will continue to be strong enough. But maybe one day, but it's not something we're looking at today. Benjamin Pham Okay. I got you. And maybe just one cleanup one on the Peace, and there's reference to the $15 million deferred revenues booked in the earlier period. Are you suggesting that under your prior accounting policies, the Peace would have been up $15 million, 1-5, more than in the third quarter results? Or is there something else that was driving? Cameron Goldade What I'm suggesting then is that in the past years, with less track record on the data, we would have deferred -- like, for example, last year, we would have deferred recognition of those volumes later in the year in 2024. We recognized them earlier. So the net difference in terms of -- if we were apples-to-apples, you would have seen a $17 million tailwind in Q3 of '24. Had it not been for that sort of timing change. Benjamin Pham I got you. So there wasn't anything else notable outside of that impacting Peace? Cameron Goldade 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 10/14

Page 11
Not more than what we said originally. So obviously, there was that piece. There were some outages that also affected this quarter. Those were the 2 biggest effects. Operator The next question comes from A.J. O'Donnell at TPH. Andrew John O'Donnell Just wondering if I could go to the marketing business for a second. I think results were pretty strong despite seeing an unplanned outage at the Aux Sable facility. I was just wondering if you could comment about your outlook for frac spreads going forward given where AECO prices are headed into the winter? Chris Scherman It's Chris Scherman. I think we expect a little bit more of the same here through the rest of the year on frac spread. Gas price remains obviously challenged as we're still waiting on winter in most markets. And I think as we look through to '25. There's definitely some things we're watching. LNG Canada is coming on. We're watching AECO gas in that sense. We've got some incremental Gulf Coast frac capacity coming on with a lot of incremental egress. So we're watching that as well but remain fairly constructive in particular because of gas price. Andrew John O'Donnell Okay. Just one maybe on the Taylor to Gordondale project. Just curious if you could just give us a little bit more explanation on kind of what's going on there and what's needed during the assessment phase to kind of get that project moving along. Janet Loduca It's Janet. So in September, the CER issued its completeness determination. So essentially, what that does is it kicks off a 430-day review process. So we'll be in the midst of that, responding to information requests. We expect hearings to happen this summer and the decision from the CER later next year. And then that will kick it over to the Governor and Council who will have 90 days to make a decision from there. So the process is underway, and we look forward to working with the CER and the other intervenors to answer their questions. There's obviously a high demand for this project. And so we expect the process to move forward. Jaret Sprott And then just on the execution side. We continue to meet with land owners due to the engineering archeology digs, all of our regulatory work, indigenous community capacity agreements, working with our customers. So we continue to spend real dollars on the asset as well and starting to order some long lead equipment in anticipation for the approval to meet our customers onstream dates. So things are going really well.

Page 12
Next question comes from Anthony Linton at Jefferies. Anthony Linton If you look at the 2 infrastructure deals you did already this year, I think those were relatively well telegraphed by their respective producers. Just wondering if you're able to give us a sense on how your conversations with customers are progressing today and the potential opportunity set that you might see there moving forward. J. Burrows Are you asking in relation to future M&A opportunities? Anthony Linton Yes. J. Burrows I mean I would say our conversations with producers in general are positive in terms of volume growth. Again, based on some of the macro changes that we see from an egress perspective, I think people are relatively bullish, especially when you look at where the Canadian dollar is and the value of condensate, which drives a lot of value across our system. I think overall, just in general, the discussions are generally positive. Again, as it relates to M&A, we're very focused on integrating the assets that we've acquired in 2024 and aren't in kind of active discussions on similar transactions, not to say that we won't be if opportunities arise, but that's not part of the conversation today. Most of the conversation today is generally around future volume growth and how we can meet those needs through gas plants, pipe and frac. Anthony Linton Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then maybe just one follow-on question. Just with those transactions with Pembina taking more of, call it, a financial partner role than an operating role. Does it change how you think about the strategy on the facility side of the business? And I assume that's more driven by the producers than from Pembina. Is that the right way to think about it? Jaret Sprott Jaret here. Yes, if you think about these 2 specific acquisitions that we just did with Veren and Whitecap, one closed and one waiting on closing. The operators, the upstream customers are going to really focus on they're well head to their oil batteries. And we'll really focus on what we do well, processing natural gas, natural gas liquids, transporting those and then obviously getting through the frac and getting their condensate into markets. So it's not really a change at all. All of their liquids are going to flow on to a Pembina operated system and through the value chain. And all other gas is going to go through Pembina operated gas plants and gas facilities. So it doesn't really change our philosophy at all. They're really good at those types of things. So they should do that, and we'll stick to what we are really good at. 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1899340046&ts=3300393&ref=l6cin7 12/14

Page 13
Operator The next question comes from Manav Gupta at UBS. Manav Gupta A quick question. Any update that you have on the progress you're making at Redwater complex expansion and Wapiti expansion? Jaret Sprott Yes. So the Redwater IV expansion physically continues to go extremely well. I was just up there a couple of weeks ago. Things are really coming out of the ground. So I'm excited to see that on the project execution side. With respect to the white space we have with respect to recontracting, recall that RFS IV was essentially kicked off due to obviously high demand from our upstream customers. But it's primarily due to 3 of the really big Montney dedications that we have in Northeast BC. That's allowed us to get that project off the ground and then we have x percent of white space. That x percent of white space, we are -- there is significant demand for it. So we're just being very strategic. For example, the 2 acquisitions that we just talked about. Whitecap and Veren, we were able to provide them incremental C3+ fractionation services due to the fact that we're actively building a new C3+ facility. We have other contracts that we just haven't been public about that we've executed. So it's going extremely well. Demand is high. Obviously, Chris has talked about AECO is low. So our customers are trying to extract every barrel of NGL out of the gas stream that they can due to the strong frac spreads here in Western Canada. So all in all, we're extremely happy with the project. It's going extremely well in execution and on the commercial side. Operator And the next question comes from Patrick Kenny at National Bank Financial. Patrick Kenny Just back to Cedar LNG, and apologies if I missed it, but any thoughts or comments around this litigation challenging the patent infringement or if you see any risk to the construction schedule as this legal process plays out? Janet Loduca It's Janet again. So as we've said before, the Steelhead patent is not something that we are concerned about. We don't believe that the Cedar project infringes on the patent or that the patent is valid. There's currently a challenge that -- it has been ruled invalid in Canada. Steelhead has challenged that and that appeal is going to be heard shortly. So no, we don't anticipate any impacts to construction or in-service date for the project.

Page 14
Okay. And then just maybe on the NGL marketing front. I was just curious how your team is managing this relatively warm start to Q4 across North America. I guess, with respect to sales volumes and how protected you might be on the hedging front relative to prior winters? Chris Scherman Yes. It's Chris. A good portion of our NGL, proprietary NGL comes out of our frac spread business. And we're about 50% hedged for the rest of the year on that and about 25% through the next year, about 25% through 2025. As far as strategy goes, we've got a fairly robust portfolio, but a good portion of it is pointed at the West Coast. And so we're benefiting right now from that Far East pricing advantage, and we try to structure it such that we're taking advantage of that wherever possible, especially in the kind of market we're looking at right now. So NGL season and recontracting season sort of upon us, but as we're working through it, we're definitely paying a lot of attention to the West Coast. Operator We have no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Scott Burrows for closing comments. J. Burrows Well, thanks, everybody. We look forward to finishing the year strong. Thanks for your time.

business. In addition to strong financial and operational results, 2024 was marked by several accomplishments that highlighted the successful execution of Pembina's strategy and our focus on strengthening our existing franchise, increasing our exposure to lighter hydrocarbons and resilient end-use markets and accessing global market pricing for Canadian energy products. Highlights included growing our presence in resilient Northeast U.S. natural gas and NGL markets by fully consolidating ownership of Alliance and Aux Sable, furthering global market access for Canadian natural gas producers by reaching a positive FID on the Cedar LNG project, adding capital efficient timely and certain capacity to accommodating growing Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin production through completion of the Phase VIII Peace Pipeline expansion, supporting growth focused Montney and Duvernay area customers with tailored solutions through 2 PGI transactions that included an expected $700 million gross to PGI funding for further infrastructure development that will be underpinned by long-term contracts and capitalizing on long-term stable demand for ethane from Alberta's growing petrochemical industry by entering a 50,000 barrel per day ethane supply agreement with Dow. We also continued commercial successes across the business in 2024, including executing incremental contracts or renewing contracts for approximately 170,000 BOE per day of pipeline transportation primarily on Alliance and Peace Pipeline as well as 25,000 barrels per day on the Nipisi pipeline. Over 6 million barrels of storage at the Edmonton terminals, approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of gas processing, primarily at Musreau, Patterson Creek in K3 and additional fractionation services across the Redwater Complex. On the major project front, we continue to progress various in-flight construction projects expected to enter service in 2026, including the RFS IV expansion, the Wapiti plant expansion and the K3 cogeneration facility. We are also looking forward to the start of construction of Cedar LNG's floating vessel in mid-2025. Further, we are continuing to progress infrastructure solutions to meet Pembina's commitment under the 50,000 barrel per day ethane supply agreement with Dow. Pembina is seeking to fulfill its commitment in the most capital-efficient manner possible and is evaluating a portfolio of opportunities, including the addition of a de- ethanizer tower at RFS III within the Redwater Complex. By leveraging its existing assets and capabilities, Pembina now expects the total capital investment required to be less than $300 million below the low end of the range previously communicated, resulting in improved capital efficiency as there is no change in the forecasted adjusted EBITDA contribution associated with the Dow supply agreement. And we are actively developing additional expansion opportunities to support growing demand for services on our conventional pipelines. These include the Taylor-to-Gordondale project, which is currently in the phase of the Canada Energy Regulators process and expansion of the Peace Pipeline system to add up to approximately 200,000 barrels per day of capacity to its market delivery pipeline from Fox Creek-to-Namao and additional expansions to support volume growth in Northeast B.C. Finally, we were excited to announce yesterday 2 new business updates. The first was that Pembina has entered into agreements for a 50% interest in the Greenlight Electricity Center Limited partnership, which is developing a gas-fired combined cycle power generation facility to be located in Alberta's Industrial Heartland on land owned by Pembina adjacent to its Redwater Complex. The Greenlight Electricity Center has been and will continue to be developed by Kineticor Asset Management. Greenlight is in active discussions with data center customers to commercially underpin the project and believe the lands within the Alberta Industrial Heartland are well suited given their proximity to transmission and utility infrastructure. The government of Alberta has set an ambitious target of attracting $100 billion in data center investments by 2030, encouraging developers to bring their own power. Pembina and Kineticor are committed to supporting this vision by delivering reliable and cost-effective power solutions at scale to data centers looking to locate in Alberta. Along with our direct investment in Greenlight, Pembina is well positioned to leverage its existing and future value chain to further support the project. The proximity of Alliance Pipeline offers potential accretive expansion opportunity to provide natural gas supply into Greenlight Electricity Center and the potential future development of Alberta Carbon Grid may provide 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 2/18

a future emissions reduction solution. This is a great example of a project we had envisioned when we first announced the development of the Alberta Carbon Grid and the Pembina Low Carbon Complex. We are excited to be partnering with Kineticor to extend our value chain even further to provide power to a promising new Alberta-based data center industry. The second announcement was that Pembina has secured the sole extraction rights from the Yellowhead Mainline, a 1 billion cubic feet per day natural gas delivery pipeline that is under construction by ATCO. Pembina is currently advancing engineering of an up to 500 million cubic feet per day straddle facility at which up to 200 -- sorry, 25,000 barrels per day of NGL mix would be extracted from the natural gas stream and transported to Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta for fractionation and sale. The straddle facility would be located on Pembina's owned land and complement our already significant experience building and operating liquids extraction facilities that include approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per day of extraction capacity to our Empress and younger facilities. The many successes of 2024 and followed by continued momentum into early 2025. Together, they reflect Pembina's leading position in the heart of the WCSB and the many opportunities available to enhance and expand our service alongside a growing Canadian energy industry. I will now thing -- turn things over to Cam to discuss in more detail the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. Cameron Goldade Thanks, Scott. As Scott noted, Pembina reported record fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.254 billion. This represents a 21% increase over the same period in the prior year. In pipelines, factors impacting the quarter primarily included a higher contribution from Alliance due to increased ownership following the Alliance/Aux Sable acquisition and higher demand for seasonal contracts, higher revenue related to the timing of capital recovery recognition, higher volumes on the Nipisi pipeline, higher contracted volumes on the Peace Pipeline system and contractual in placement adjustments on tolls, which were largely offset by earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue during the first half of 2024. And finally, lower net revenue on the Cochin Pipeline, largely due to lower front holds and lower interruptible volumes during the period. In facilities, factors impacting the quarter included the inclusion of Aux Sable following the Aux Sable/Alliance acquisition and a higher contribution from PGI due to higher revenue associated with oil batteries acquired in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well as higher volumes at certain PGI assets and the timing of capital recovery recognition. In marketing and new ventures, fourth quarter results reflect the net impact of higher net revenue from contracts with customers due to increased ownership interest in Aux Sable, higher NGL margins and lower realized gains on commodity-related derivatives. Finally, in the Corporate segment, fourth quarter results were higher than the prior period due to lower incentive costs. Earnings in the fourth quarter were $572 million. This represents an 18% decrease over the same period in the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, the decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter was primarily due to the net impact of the reversal of the previous impairment related to the Nipisi pipeline, which impacted the fourth quarter of 2023. Unrealized gains recognized by PGI on interest rate derivative financial instruments compared to unrealized losses in 2023. Unrealized losses on commodity-related derivatives compared to unrealized gains in the prior period, unrealized gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments recognized by Cedar LNG and higher interest expense and higher income tax expense. Total volumes were 3.67 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 6% over the same period in the prior year reflecting the net impact of the Alliance/Aux Sable acquisition, the reactivation of the Nipisi pipeline, lower volumes on the Peace Pipeline system due to earlier recognition of take-or-pay deferred revenue in the first half of 2024, which more than offset the increase from higher contracted volumes and lower interruptible volumes on the Cochin Pipeline. 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 3/18

The fourth quarter contributed to full year results that included earnings of $1.874 billion, record adjusted EBITDA of $4.408 billion, which was 15% higher than in 2023. Cash flow from operating activities of $3.214 billion and record adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $3.265 billion. Thanks to strong results in 2024, Pembina generated meaningful free cash flow, which is allocated to strengthening the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders by increasing the common share dividend by 3.4%. At December 31, 2024, based on the trailing 12 months, the ratio of proportionally consolidated debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.5x. Notably, this ratio reflects only 3 quarters of contribution from the increased ownership in Alliance and Aux Sable, but all of the debt associated with that transaction. Our leverage remains at the low end of our targeted range reflects our strong balance sheet and supporting a strong BBB credit rating. I'll now turn things back to Scott. J. Burrows Thanks, Cam. In closing, I'll once again say how excited we are about the opportunities ahead. We believe Pembina is best positioned to benefit from the growth we are seeing and expect to continue to see in the WCSB. Our extensive network of strategically placed assets provides a full suite of midstream and transportation services across all commodities, natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil, and we are confident that our customer service offering provides unmatched optionality and flexibility that our customers value. We have an abundance of opportunities ahead of us and a clear pathway of -- to growth with approximately $4 billion of secured projects currently under construction and more than $4 billion of additional projects in various stages of development. We are looking forward to the year ahead and continuing to share our progress with you. Thank you for joining us this morning. And can you please open up the line for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of A.J. O'Donnell from TPH. Andrew John O'Donnell I was just hoping to maybe start on the rights to the NGLs of the Yellowhead Mainline project. Trying to think about what kind of commercial and growth opportunities that might create for you? Trying to think of this maybe along the lines of additional frac capacity or export dock capacity. Jaret Sprott A.J., this is Jaret here. Thanks for the question. So yes, like Scott mentioned in his opening remarks, we were awarded exclusive extraction rights on the Yellowhead Mainline which will go into service kind of the latter half of 2027 based on public disclosure. We estimate we could build probably something in the neighborhood of maybe 500 million a day of extraction capacity, resulting in approximately 25,000 barrels of NGL extraction. So what we're doing right now, A.J., is we're just evaluating our 2 supply portfolios of C2, one which we've been fairly public with lately supporting Dow's Net-Zero cracker, just evaluating how would this C2 fit into our overall portfolio. So that's ongoing, and we expect to have a little bit more information on that probably at the May call. But then obviously -- so that's the C2 component of the opportunity. And then with the C3+, obviously, we're actively building RFS IV, which is an incremental 55,000 barrels of C3+ extraction capacity fractionation. These barrels, we could just shift it across the river and put that into our existing frac capacity if we're not fully 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 4/18

contracted. And that would be very complementary to our marketing NGL book today. We have a large portfolio of C3+. It'd be very complementary to that. And Chris and his team, they would continue to find the best market for those products, either domestically into the United States and/or internationally through West Coast exports. Scott did mention through the acquisition of Aux Sable and closing that here this summer, Pembina does have a nice contiguous block of land right adjacent to Dow's Cracker and that will be the terminus essentially of where we would put our extraction facility. We have access to the AEGS pipeline. That's the Alberta Ethane Gathering system right there and then the Redwater fractionation complex, where we would most likely send our C3+ from this is just across the river, and we have existing pipelines that go back and forth between today. So we have operations in the area. We have actually between Channahon, Younger and Empress, we have well over 3 Bcf of this type of operation. So we're well versed in how to build, operate these types of assets. Also mentioned -- yes, sorry, A.J., I just going to also mention that the Alliance Pipeline, Scott mentioned the opportunity there as it comes in close proximity to Greenlight but also the Alliance pipeline goes right through this plot of land. So there'd be further evaluation down the road about potentially if we ever wanted to do straddling that pipeline down the road. So that's an option as well. Andrew John O'Donnell Okay. I appreciate the detail. That kind of goes into my next question just on Greenlight and just trying to think about the potential size of the gas requirement for the facility and how that could translate to additional capacity on Alliance? And then also just kind of along those lines, if these projects kind of make it across the finish line and we see incremental capital invested into Alliance. Does that help mitigate at all the ongoing rate case situation with shippers? I mean I realize that there's a timing mismatch here, but is that being factored into your discussion with shippers currently? Stuart Taylor A.J., it's Stu Taylor. With respect to the gas supply, it's one of the things that attracted us to this opportunity. But what we have right now is each phase will consume approximately 80 million cubic feet per day of gas. That will grow as you [indiscernible] the phases get built out. Obviously, that's a significant number for gas egress for the province as well. I'll let Jaret talk more. Jaret Sprott Yes. Just on the Alliance. So where we're at with respect to that file and talking a little bit about expansion. So we've essentially met all the CER obligations here in the month of February. And then we have ongoing biweekly meetings with the large shipper group. It's about 40-plus individuals and just working expeditiously to get a negotiated settlement here in 2025 and get that in front of the regulator. What I will say with respect to the expansion, there's some common themes that we continue to hear, A.J. Number one, our shippers on Alliance very much value the service that Alliance provides, they very much like the endpoint getting their gas into Chicago, but also the high reliability, availability and the cost structure of the pipeline. And part of the conversation has got to expansion opportunities. So there is high demand for expansion opportunities from the shipper group, and we're just evaluating that right now, would that be a short haul type expansion opportunity into the Fort Saskatchewan area as industrial demand increases or is that a long-haul type expansion where we go all the way down to the Chicago land area. 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 5/18

Page 6
If you recall, Alliance was originally set up to do what we call the B side compressors. So building out the B side compressors where Alliance already owns that land today, that would be the long haul and then we could do a shorter haul version just into the Fort Saskatchewan area. So it is an active conversation we're having with the shippers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Theresa Chen Related to the NGLs off of the Yellowhead Mainline and the potential of 500 of MMcf per day straddle facility. Can you talk about how -- what kind of capital requirement that could entail? And as it translates to potentially 25,000 barrels per day of NGL with a significant C2 component. How much of the 25,000 could be C22 supplement your 50,000 barrel per day supply agreement and then between that, the 300 -- and the $300 million de-ethanizer, how much of the 50 could those 2 pieces comprise? Would just love to get more details of the quantitative makeup of the 50,000 barrels per day as you see it? Jaret Sprott Okay. Yes, I'm going to try to unpack those in order. So I think the first question was with respect to cost. An asset of this size, we believe, would be in that neighborhood of $400 million to $500 million. Now this is fairly preliminary. We would -- we're obviously going to be doing a significant amount of more work with respect to the engineering and as we progress through our gating system here at Pembina, but that's the rough order of magnitude. With respect to the composition of that 25,000, you would expect to be roughly, call it, 50% of that would be ethane. The remainder would be your C3+ component. And then how does it fit into our overall portfolio. So that's what we're talking about right now is we have our existing supply agreements. There's also demand for future expansions with -- in Alberta. Dow has been very public about Phase III, et cetera. So we're just evaluating right now, do we put these barrels into part of our existing supply portfolio? Or do we make this part of the incremental? You mentioned RFS III de-ethanizer. We've been fairly public about that. There is an opportunity there to -- we have existing barrels in our portfolio that we can add to the incremental demand. There is new opportunities such as the RFS III de-eth and then there's these barrels. So it's a little bit too early and premature to be talking about the actual details, but expect to provide a lot more color at our May conference call. Theresa Chen Understood. And maybe turning to the LNG front, given the geopolitical developments across Europe, Russia and Ukraine as well as the policy movements in the U.S., can you talk about your progress to date in contracting the capacity you have remaining on Cedar? Stuart Taylor It's Stu again. We've been working hard since late 2024 working with potential acquirers of this capacity, we're very pleased with the response that we've had. We have a broad range of customers who are looking for LNG service, including both Canadian producers as well as NOC and IOC counterparts looking to participate. We've had term sheets out and term sheets returned well in excess of the capacity that we have. And so we're working 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 6/18

Page 7
through that process. We will soon be looking to shortlist and begin more detailed negotiations with these counterparts, and we're very excited about where we sit at this point in time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish Maybe I'll just start with 2 questions here on the Greenlight project. So first is just trying to understand how much is your share of CapEx if we just kind of assume $2,000 per kilowatt than your share could be as high as $1.8 billion. And I know it's going to happen in phases, but I just want to understand if that's in the range of how you see your investment into the project and the time frame for spending? Stuart Taylor Yes. So we're essentially 50% of the project at this point in time, early days, but we're looking at essentially $1.5 billion per phase of 450 megawatts, so up to 1,800 megawatts. So our share would be, again, 50% on a go- forward basis. Our plan -- there will be a phased development. There could be opportunity as we stage this out, we could accelerate some of the phases and combine them. But at this point in time, it's a phased development of the 4 phases with construction. FID beginning, we're targeting some time in '26 and then construction through to 2030 -- 2029, 2030. Cameron Goldade And maybe Praneeth, I'll just chime in. It's Cam here. And just as a reminder to all the listeners, where we stand today, following the Alliance/ Aux Sable acquisition, our run rate of free cash flow after dividends available for investment is in the range of about $1.25 billion to about $1.5 billion per year. We've obviously said that through 2025 and 2026, as we're closing out some of the in-flight projects and the heaviest spend period on Cedar. We are running at probably a little above -- a little excess free cash flow but obviously closer to it. And then 2027 and beyond, we begin generating material free cash flow again available for all that investment. So that obviously lines up really well with the opportunities that we're talking about here. J. Burrows Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the project itself, Greenlight. Can you help us understand what the return profile looks like relative to your traditional midstream investments. I mean this is a bit of a step out in terms of taking a piece of the power generation part. So would you expect higher returns than your traditional hurdle rates? And then can you say whether the economics would be secured by long-term contracts? Or would you be taking on any merchant exposure? Cameron Goldade Praneeth, let me start with -- I think it was your second question there. And I think one of the things that we really want to make sure is very clear is that, obviously, the power generation angle of this opportunity is a great project in its own right, but what really makes us excited about it as it relates to Pembina's value chain, is the integration 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 7/18

Page 8
potential. So the opportunity -- obviously, we have a significant gas business today through our gas processing business through Alliance, Obviously, we have an aspiring carbon sequestration solution. So the integration of the opportunity with those projects is what really got us excited about it. To your specific questions, we would see sort of base returns consistent with the midstream infrastructure return at this point, probably a little early to start throwing out exact multiples, but I would say it's within that range. And lastly, I think it is, of course, our intention to have a long-term contract underpinning this project. And obviously, that's -- those negotiations are ongoing. Operator Your next question is from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Robert Hope Maybe going back to Alliance, can you add some color on kind of what the initial consultations have been with shippers as well as is the expectation that the existing contracts could get reopened? Or is this really just focused on IT and the spot tools? Jaret Sprott Yes, Rob, thanks. It's Jaret here. So I would categorize the group into just a few buckets, right? So I mentioned there's obviously 40-plus folks in the room. You have long-term shippers, you have people who play in the seasonal strip in the IT component and then some really large long-term shippers, and then you have some of our smaller shippers on the pipeline. So those are kind of the 3 groups that we're working with right now. I can't get into too much detail with respect to what everyone wants, but we are trying to hone into a mutual agreement that meets the needs of all 40-plus individuals. And I can say it's going very well, and the conversations have been extremely respectful and progressive as we continue to work. With respect to the contracts, that is actually what some of the conversations are around depending on which route we go, there could be different outcomes. And obviously, people that have a lot of capacity on the pipeline when I keep that capacity because obviously, it supports your condensate development plans and those types of things long term. And there's obviously people who maybe don't have a lot of capacity on the asset who would love to have more capacity on the asset. So that's something that we're working through. But at the end of the day, the takeaway is, it is a little bit early. I think in May, we'll be able to give a little bit more color, demand is high for the asset. And we just got to kind of "grind through it here over the next couple of weeks". Anything else Cam, Scott, do you want to add on that? No. Robert Hope Right. Appreciate that. And then maybe just going back to the ethane capital intensity commentary about being below the $300 million range by maintaining the EBITDA profile there. Can you maybe add a little bit more color on kind of where you're seeing the savings or kind of where you're leading to in terms of the optionality and the end solution. Jaret Sprott It's not so much savings, Rob. It's just really -- like we had a portfolio of projects that could add to the totality of our supply book. And it's really -- we just got really diligent in just going through those and evaluating each one on 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 8/18

Page 9
a stand-alone basis. Where did we have extra capacity across our enterprise, where we could maximize the ethane recoveries through existing assets. So that plays a portfolio -- or sorry, a portion of the portfolio. So really just getting militant and grinding it down. And ultimately, it's kind of -- we've been signaling it's kind of honing into that Redwater III de-ethanizer tower, which is the most capital efficient. Redwater III was built with a lot of the bells and whistles to accommodate that tower. So it was really just doing the work and working through our portfolio of opportunities and getting the maximum out of our existing steel that we have in the ground. So through a combination of that, the team did a tremendous job of coming up with being at that low end of that capital range. And now Yellowhead, obviously, now we have to just take a step back and evaluate the entire portfolio, with Yellowhead, obviously, comes a lot more C3+. So just working that into the mix. But like I said earlier, there is incremental demand for incremental phases of polymer development here in Alberta. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aaron MacNeil from TD Cowen. Aaron MacNeil How would you characterize the Greenlight projects gas turbine slot reservations and other long lead time items and more generally, how far along is the sort of feed process? Stuart Taylor It's Stu again. So we've been working with the Kineticor development team for over 1.5 years. They are at the beginning of -- our excitement with them is their expertise that they have, and they just completed the Cascade power plant in the Edson area as well as they progress the AESO queue position. And again, that's what excites a lot of our data center customers or the potential is the speed to market. We are going to be in that turbine queue to as we go out. We have not placed those orders at this point in time. But again, I mentioned FID is expected in 2026 and our in-service date in the 2030 time frame. We're happy where we are with the queue. We're happy with the progress. We're engineering work to take place in 2025 and reaching that FID decision in 2026. Aaron MacNeil Got you. And then maybe just to return to A.J.'s question on increased NGL volumes flowing through the system. Can you comment specifically about that stock capacity he asked about and helping your customers just export those incremental volumes more generally. J. Burrows Go ahead. Chris Scherman Aaron, it's Chris Scherman. We're certainly paying a lot of attention to what volume growth in general looks like in the basin, and that's a piece of it. And undoubtedly continue to see the value of West Coast export. I think we've talked about some of the efficiencies we're driving at our own facility. We've talked about some of the other 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 9/18

Page 10
projects that are on the go on the West Coast. And undoubtedly, each incremental barrel definitely supports those export positions. So we're keeping an eye on them. We don't have anything specific linked to or related to Yellowhead per se. But obviously, we're bullish West Coast export and like what we have there today and see that growth being supportive of the projects that are underway. Jaret Sprott It should be noted that these C3+ barrels would be -- like they would be proprietary Pembina barrels. They wouldn't be the barrels of the shippers on the Yellowhead pipeline. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Manav Gupta I wanted to go to Slide 15, executing inside projects. Number of projects coming on in the first half of 2026, can you give us like some kind of progress percentage? How -- what's the completion at this point and general progress that you are making to getting these 3 projects all in first half of 2026. Jaret Sprott Yes. Thanks for the question. So project execution, I'll speak to probably just the 3 largest ones we have on the go here. So the K3 Cochin, the Wapiti expansion -- Wapiti Gas Plant expansion, PGI focused projects or PGI projects that Pembina is executing and then our RFS IV frac expansion and rail expansion. So all 3 of those projects are going extremely well and no concerns with respect to timing and/or execution. We've got through each one of those projects through some pretty material milestones. Equipment is showing up, active boots on the ground in all 3 of those locations. So no supply chain concerns. And I would like to just have a bit of a shout- out with respect to throughout the last couple of months, there's been some pretty extreme weather here in Alberta. The safety execution throughout the last couple of months and previous to that has been excellent. It's been world-class in Pembina's opinion. And the cost structure continues to come in as expected. So like I said, we're getting through some pretty key milestones here and the equipment is getting delivered to site, and it's really impressive to see these new assets coming out of the ground. Manav Gupta Perfect. My quick follow-up here is, you obviously talked to a lot of producers. What's your internal outlook for the West Canadian Sedimentary Basin volume growth, whether it's gas or liquids or oil like how should we think about the growth over the next 2 or 3 years based on your internal estimates? J. Burrows Yes. It's Scott here. When we use a lot of our own internal data and third-party data and generally speaking, they're lining up. When we look at third-party data, we're generally seeing growth in that kind of mid-single-digit area. And I would say that that's relatively consistent with our own internal forecast. I would say the only 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 10/18

Page 11
hesitation I have right now is just given all the volatility in the market and the uncertainty that puts a little bit of a cloud over it. But absent that, that mid-single digit is something that we continue to forecast. Jaret Sprott I'd maybe just add to that, that although the average is mid-single digits, some of Pembina's biggest shippers. If you go into their detailed public information, some of them are growing at higher than that. And it should be noted that some of our customers are drilling into take-or-pay contracts. Some of them would be over. So although the physical volumes will continue to grow, we believe that we're in a pretty good position to continue to meet their growth demand. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets. Maurice Choy Just wanted to come back to the discussion about returns on Greenlight, you mentioned that the base returns will be consistent with your midstream assets. But I suppose if you look at your existing value chain, there can be a relatively wide range depending on your exposure to volumes and prices, for example. So if I think about this, are the returns more close to, say, this -- the more traditional 7x to build multiples that you have? Or are we talking about something goes to 9 or 10x for a long-term contracted take-or-pay infrastructure? Cameron Goldade Yes, Maurice, I mean I think negotiations are ongoing. So I'm a little reticent to start to point to a specific data point. I would just say, obviously, I mean, you've obviously painted the range of our return profile historically, and we would characterize it within that range. But given the stage of negotiations, I'm reluctant to sort of specifically quantify it at this stage. Maurice Choy Maybe just holistically, if you took a step back away from Greenlight and look at an opportunity like this, Yellowhead and everything. Where do you sense your -- the appetite for risk and -- versus returns? And has anything changed in the last 6 to 12 months in terms of how you view your next opportunity and how you view your return criteria? Cameron Goldade I think what we look at is obviously a full-scale value chain across the business, and obviously, opportunities across that value chain, which continue to come. I think part of it is, obviously, the commercial angle. Part of it is execution and controlling your costs and protecting that. I think Jaret exemplified what we think is one of our advantages in that. Our track record on capital execution, I think, has been incredibly strong historically. And so for us, that gives us a lot of confidence to be able to sort of -- to be able to put forward a compelling proposition to the customers. In terms of the commerce, obviously, that's market facing. I think we have a history of trying to find creative solutions. I think that shows up through a couple of the transactions that we did with PGI and 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 11/18

[indiscernible] and Duvernay over the course of this year. I think it's shown up historically in our contracting and our pipelines business. And so we continue to look for opportunities to be creative. Ultimately, the market drives what returns are. But I think we control what we can control. And when you look at sort of our capabilities in building assets specifically, relative to competition, that is one area where we differentiate ourselves and where we believe we have a competitive advantage. Maurice Choy And maybe just finishing off with more holistic strategy question about using Greenlight as an example here. Obviously, you mentioned that Greenlight benefits from being close in proximity to Alliance and maybe what you may want to do with ACG. Does that mean that you can probably scope down future power opportunity to once they're close to infrastructure versus being a more big IPP player within the province? J. Burrows 100%. This is all about the data center play, the value chain extension cited behind the fence on our lands. You're not going to see us do an IPP and [ leverage ] or something like that. This is very focused and targeted and on strategy. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Citi. Spiro Dounis I want to touch first on tariffs. You guys pointed out in the release, no imminent impact to operations. But does seem to have reinvigorated a broader discussion in Canada just around energy infrastructure and maybe what best suits your needs. So curious if that's reshaping how you're thinking about projects that you're pursuing longer term. And if you're already maybe seeing that sort of shift where projects are coming in that maybe weren't on the radar a few months ago? J. Burrows Yes, it's Scott here. As we pointed out and as you said in the press release, no immediate financial impact from the tariffs. From our perspective, we're hearing all the right things and now we need to start to see all the right things. And so from our perspective, we do see a sentiment change in terms of politicians in terms of the general public, which we think is generally positive for the industry. We've been progressing lots of projects in the background, and we will continue to progress those projects. And hopefully, with what's happening, it will be obvious to the country that these projects need to get built. And so we think that there's definitely positive tailwinds. You're not going to see anything in the next day or 2, obviously, but we continue to see tailwinds in terms of potentially deregulation, speedier project approvals, which should benefit the industry long term. Spiro Dounis Got it. That's helpful color, Scott. Second question, just a quick cleanup one related to CapEx. The December guidance pointed to potential for CapEx maybe increase as much as $200 million if more projects got 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 12/18

Page 13
sanctioned. Obviously, you sort of announced a few last night and today. So just curious kind of where we sit with that $200 million number? Cameron Goldade Spiro, it's Cam here. I think some of them have progressed along the way. I'd say maybe about half of that has progressed long. I mean one of the big pieces there was the de-ethanizer at RFS. We're continuing to move through gates internally on that as well as some of the Northeast BC spending, which continues to move through gates. So I would say that at this point, we're not all the way towards that upper end. We're marching through the range. And if you want to take a point, probably about halfway. Operator Next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Elias Jossen This is Eli Jossen on for Jeremy. Maybe just on the 2025 guide, I mean, saw a pretty strong print in 4Q, and we recognized some seasonality in the business, but how should we think about the $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion range incorporating some conservatism? Is that tied to any cushion for Alliance? Or can you just help frame that up a bit? Cameron Goldade Yes. Eli, so I think the way we would characterize the range is a couple of things. Obviously, there is seasonality in our business. And I think it comes from about 3 different places. Obviously, the first is obviously the inherent seasonality in the marketing business, which is weighted to Q1 and Q4. I think that's generally well understood. With the advent of more West Coast egress for the liquids business in the last sort of 2 to 3 years, I mean, obviously, that has moderated some, but even you still see that in a large extent on the pricing side. And I think you can see that this year as well. The second thing would be obviously the repair and integrity work portfolio that occurs in our business. And so often, that results in much of that occurring in the third quarter. Some of our work occurs in the first and the fourth quarter because of winter access only. But there is some seasonality in that just based on obviously getting through spring, getting to work and planning our work plan. And then the last piece would obviously be the Alliance interruptible profile. So as we've seen in past years and continue to be our outlook this year is obviously winter seasons tend to see higher interruptible demand, consequently higher demand for service and that would lead to a relatively softer Q2 and Q3 for that asset relative to Q1 and Q4. In some cases, the seasonality has been in some years upwards of 15%, like from a Q1 to Q2 type of sequential numbers. So I think we think about that and we see that. I think the last point I would make with respect to the overall guidance for the year is I want to remind everyone that we do our guidance our forecasting based on the forward strip as it relates to the direct commodity exposure part of our business in the marketing segment. And if you look at that business today, obviously, we've had a very good January so far. I mean, I think most of the pricing, despite the tariff noise and volatility has shown up well. We see -- we saw Belvieu propane in the $0.90 range. Obviously, the dollar -- Canadian dollar has weakened, and that's a net positive for our business. But I think when you look at the curves for the balance of the year, I mean, if you were to look at a frac spread, for example, through the balance of the year, there's effectively a $10 difference between January and December frac-spread. So there's a fair amount of 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 13/18

Page 14
backwardation in the curves at the moment. Obviously, if we continue to see each month churn by and not see that backwardation occur, that's a positive for us, but we only know what the market tells us right now or we're willing to put our fingers on and that's what's reflected in the guidance. J. Burrows I would just add as well. There were some call it, onetime capital recoveries in Q4 and just ensuring that those obviously aren't annualized into 2025. Those were select in 2024. So just ensuring everyone on the call is aware of that and doesn't carry that forward. Elias Jossen That's really good color there. And then maybe just on Cedar. It seems like the project risk profile has decreased meaningfully. So how should we think about future offtake contracts that you do sign maybe carrying a higher rate to reflect that? Can you give us some color about what kind of demand market you're seeing? I know you highlighted in the release, there's a lot of demand. So just color on that contracting environment. Stuart Taylor So Stu again. So again, we went out and like you stated, we do believe that we're derisking the project and we undertook and stepped up to FID the project. As such, we're out in the market. We've looked at to benefit from that derisking at this point in time. And as I stated previously, we've had lots of response and lots of positive response from both multinational oil companies and Canadian producers and LNG offtakers today. So we're pretty excited about taking that next step and believe we are, one, derisking the project, as you stated, but at the same time, improving the economics for the project as well. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier I just wanted to follow up on the Greenlight project a little bit here. I wonder if you could talk about the genesis of the project and what attracted you to gas-fired power in the first place other than the integration aspect. Stuart Taylor Rob, it's Stu again. We started down the path, and we've mentioned and talked about our land adjacent to the Redwater assets, our low carbon complex. And so we started looking for tenants and opportunities to utilize that land and power generation was one of those opportunities. We looked at in the early days, the carbon sequestration link and the connection to that. As things went on and we began working with the Kineticor team and as the markets change and where this power -- what was the plan for the power sale as opposed to just selling into the grid as such. Kineticor changed and pivoted and we started talking about and began meeting with co-locators and hyperscalers, and we've seen this opportunity to take the power generation right to a midstream type model with long-term contracts off the back end. So it quickly became very appealing to Pembina that we could make this look exactly like one of our other businesses. And as you mentioned, beyond that and the 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 14/18

Page 15
success we see with that change in the data center growth. Obviously, the interconnection, we always talked about providing services. Gas supply has potential. We have -- we have the capability and the infrastructure to provide gas, to provide water, to provide the land, as I've already mentioned. And so the integration opportunity just grew, but we like the project right from the start located on our land. Robert Catellier Yes, that's helpful. And that's a good segue to the follow-up here about merchant exposure. I'm just curious, just in general, how much capital are you comfortable allocating to power? I know there's a couple of other projects, Cochin and K3, but -- and then really the merchant exposure you're willing to take on, for example, I know you want to contract this in a way that it looks like the rest of your risk profile. But you have an internal load that can act as a bit of an internal hedge. And then to the extent that your appetite is different than your partners for future phases. For example, they might want to do more on spec than you're interested in doing. Are there off- ramps where that -- in the circumstance where you're not aligned with your partner that you don't have to FID subsequent phases? Cameron Goldade Rob, I'll start out. I mean I think, first of all, our intention here is to match the power load with the need from the facility. So we don't see ourselves getting into the merchant power business. That's not what this is about. This is very much about leveraging the facilities in and around our existing assets, leveraging the integration and obviously having a really attractive sort of long-term annuity with very high quality, high creditworthy counterparties and the ability to use that to leverage the rest of our business. In terms of how much capital we could see allocating to this, I mean, obviously, we've talked about 3 phases as a part of this as sort of the initial piece. I think we need to see where that goes. And what I mean by that is we haven't talked about more than that. If the opportunities to grow are larger, I think we'll analyze that as we always would. But to go back to my initial response, this is not an intention to get into the merchant business, this is a long-term fee-based annuity just like the rest of our business. Robert Catellier Yes. Okay. Understood. And then finally, I just wanted to follow up on the tariff question update here. I'm curious how you're changing your approach to the NGL marketing year given the threat of tariffs and now they've been seemingly kicked out to April, which is not helpful given the marketing year. So are you doing anything in terms of language in your agreements? Or other -- changing maybe the amount of exposure you want to have to marketing this year given the tariff threat? Chris Scherman It's Chris Sherman. You mentioned that timing isn't great for the NGL contract year as far as sort of getting those contracts buttoned down. But we've been largely positioning ourselves, not tariff specific, but largely positioning ourselves as much off the West Coast as possible. And so that's really helped insulate us, first of all. And then I'd say, secondly, at least to date, we've seen a fairly reasonable approach with buyers where tariffs could have an 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 15/18

Page 16
impact and I think we will certainly be adding terms that are tariff specific and finding the right way to get that business done. It's not a big concern for us going into the NGL year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO Capital Markets. Benjamin Pham I wanted to go to your guidance you initiated last year, the 4% to 6% CAGR. And can you comment on directionally with the Cochin recontracting and some of the levers you're seeing going forward, how you're thinking about where you're tracking to that range? And then also, your plan directionally, is this an annual role your contemplating on that guide? Or are you -- is it more of a way until it ends and you're rolling a couple of years out? Cameron Goldade Ben, it's Cam here. Listen, I think in terms of the guide, obviously, we put it out last May. We're sort of halfway through it. I would say that we're happy with what we're seeing. We're seeing good opportunities, a big focus on that time frame, on productivity and sort of margin in the business. Certainly, we're trending well. I'm sort of reluctant to quantify it at this point in terms of exactly where we are. But certainly, we're very pleased with where we are tracking in the range. And I think there's a number of opportunities here, which the team is working on. And some of them will occur in that time frame, some of them will occur beyond. But like to sort of see that come to fruition before we start to stretch time line out even further. I would sort of mention that I think when we look at our guidance, lots of numbers out there in the peer group. We always talk about ours on a fee-based dollar per share and we think as we look at some of those comparable numbers from some of our peers, the 4% to 6% continues to stack up in line with our peers and well for the most part. Benjamin Pham Got it. And maybe a follow-up on Alliance. I'm not sure maybe Stu has mentioned this as things are going quite well. Can you unpack that a bit of that. Is that more of -- you feel pretty good about the timing of how this could get resolved maybe a little bit quicker than you expected in terms of discovery? Or is it related to maybe something else that you're referring to? Jaret Sprott Ben, Jaret here. Yes, I can't really get into the details. I think my commentary around it, it's going well, as we have routine meetings with the shipper group. The shipper group is -- we're having great conversations in the room really trying to get down to brass tacks on what all the parties want. So that is the encouragement here. And then I mentioned it earlier in the call, but hopefully in the May time frame, we're able to give a lot more color with respect to the progression of commercial opportunities there. Operator 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 16/18

Page 17
Your last question for today comes from the line of Patrick Kenny from National Bank. Patrick Kenny Yes. I know there's been a lot on Greenlight already, but I just wanted to confirm, since you won't be in the driver seat per se on the development and construction process, and I know you're still currently in negotiations, but curious if you might be contemplating anything unique within your LP with Kineticor that might mitigate or protect your exposure to the risk of cost overruns as the complex has built out just given this isn't really your core business? Stuart Taylor Got it, Stu. We -- in taking a step with Greenlight and the JV that we've entered into. We look back, did our due diligence with respect to Kineticor, their capabilities, where they are sitting, the progress that they've made to date and became comfortable. We are a 50% partner as described as we go forward. We made sure that we secured the correct governance that we need to have this go forward on with our controls in place and our oversight that we thought we needed as we would go. We're making sure that we have the right people to stay on top of the project from this position, and we're comfortable where we're going. Yes. And just to remind, again, these are not new. They've just completed building a Cascade power plant. We're excited about working with them and again, believe that we've made -- selected the correct partner for us in this endeavor. Patrick Kenny Got it. Okay. And then switching gears to Northeast BC just with the renewed support for resource infrastructure in the province. Can you provide a bit more color as to what you think industry might need over the near to medium term with respect to whether it's additional fractionation capacity or other infrastructure over and above what you might have in flight today? I'm thinking really especially if and when LNG Canada sanctions Phase II. Jaret Sprott This is Jaret. Yes, great question. So obviously, Scott mentioned in our call that we're actively proceeding and Cam mentioned, we're deploying capital on our Northeast BC expansions with just what's in front of us with LNG Canada Phase I, Cedar, Woodfibre, et cetera, we see a material amount of NGLs, condensate and obviously, our C3+ coming out of that area. So our long-term view, the macro view would be not only does Pembina's projects are going to be required, but there's probably other third-party projects that are going to be required and that we're supportive of taking place because the industry is going to require it, especially with LNG Canada Phase II, potentially on the horizon. Maybe [indiscernible] gets a Cedar II one day, et cetera, et cetera. But there is a lot of -- there's a lot of very good momentum with respect to West Coast exports. With respect to fractionation, our RFS IV project continues, really glad that we sanctioned that when we did. It's -- we're going to deliver that at a very effective cost per barrel when you do the math on that greenfield project, and it's getting highly contracted and adding a bunch of more NGLs from Yellowhead to [ Scherman's ] book on our marketing business takes up more NGL capacity. So we do believe macro that another fractionator will be required to meet that NGL demand, obviously, because we're tight. Our competitors have been talking about it, Pembina has been talking about it. And we think we're in obviously a really good situation to be able to capture more of that growth opportunity as well. 3/1/25, 12:34 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1915659204&ts=3388725&ref=l6cin7 17/18

Patrick Kenny Okay. I appreciate that. And not sure if you could provide any update on your application on the Western pipeline system. It looks like we might get a decision in April. But just wondering what, what the financial impact might be if you do get the green light to shut down the line or not sure if you took any provision in the quarter or not. But maybe on the flip side, if you do need to keep the pipe operating roughly what quantum of capital might be required to maintain the integrity of the line? Jaret Sprott Okay. Good question, Pat. So yes, we shut down the southern portion of the Western line. I think in 2022, we took that out of service. This pipeline is significantly older than myself. I would say that it's becoming -- it's getting to its useful end of economic life. We're going to have to deploy more and more capital to maintain the operate- ability to save reliable operation of that asset and hence, the abandonment application. The financial impact is very immaterial to our overall business, taking the pipeline out of service. So we're just kind of working through that right now. I don't think -- I won't get into the magnitude of the capital that's required to keep it in service, but it's not a material amount, all things considered with respect to our overall integrity program. But it is a substantial amount of work internally for us to maintain that asset and keep it in the safe, reliable operation that we expect across our asset base. Cameron Goldade And Pat, it's Cam here. I would just add that, of course, there is a single customer on that line today. And as has been the case, it's a cost recovery mechanism for capital spend and for repairs and maintenance. We would continue to expect that if investment was required going forward, and that is obviously part of the dynamic here is whether it can be operated in an economic way in the future. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Scott Burrows for closing comments. Please go ahead. J. Burrows Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we were very pleased to end the year with a very strong Q4 and some exciting new growth projects. So thanks to all of those on the call, our investors, our shareholders, our employees. We look forward to a great 2025. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's conference call.

Pembina's officer team is led by Scott Burrows, President and Chief Executive Officer; and includes Eva Bishop, Senior Vice President and Corporate Services Officer; Cameron Goldade, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Janet Loduca, Senior Vice President, External Affairs and Chief Legal and Sustainability Officer; Chris Scherman, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Strategy Officer; Jaret Sprott, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Stuart Taylor, Senior Vice President and Corporate Development Officer. Further, I would like to thank the entire Pembina team, who has worked tirelessly to make today possible. I know that they were here very late last night. So thank you very much. We have a full agenda today, and you will hear from our executive team about the successes we have achieved, since our last Investor Day as well as our positioning for the future. There will be a short break in the middle. And we will close with a Q&A session. If all goes according to plan, we aim to close by about 11:30 Eastern in any case before none. And now I would like to welcome Scott Burrows, our President and Chief Executive Officer. J. Burrows Thanks to everyone, who is here with us today in the room and to those on the phone. We're happy to be here today to share in greater detail our thoughts on the industry, our business and our path forward from here. We're proud of what we've built. We're excited and optimistic for the future. We truly believe it is an exciting time in the Canadian energy industry and that Pembina is at the heart of that industry. Today, you will hear from various members of our executive team. I will start with an overview of Pembina's business in our industry. You will hear from us why we believe Pembina occupies a unique and valuable place at the center of the Canadian industry. Chris will cover Pembina's strategy and how we position ourselves for long-term success. Jaret will provide an overview of Pembina's Pipelines and Facilities divisions highlighting, in particular, the ongoing developments in the WCSB, including 3 transformational catalysts and how Pembina is uniquely positioned to benefit on a wave of growth. Chris will provide an overview of our marketing business, which helps augment our core business. Stu will cover new ventures, including our proposed Cedar LNG project and Cam will wrap things up with an update on our financial outlook and how we intend to execute our strategy with the same discipline that has made us so successful to date. But first, it has been 5 years since we have done an Investor Day, and a lot has changed and yet a lot hasn't. So we thought it was worthwhile to step back and recognize how Pembina and the industry have transformed over the past 5 years and recap some of the many achievements. I'm going to start with a couple of stats on how we've grown the business to set the stage. We've seen our conventional volume, which we generally see as a proxy for basin growth, have grown on whole over 17%. We've placed $2.4 billion of projects into service and have an additional $1.2 billion of projects underway with another $4 billion under development. We've executed 3 major transactions including the acquisition of Kinder Morgan Canada, the creation of Pembina Gas Services and the recent acquisition and additional interest of Alliance and Aux Sable all done accretively and positions us to continue to capture incremental growth. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 2/37

Page 3
The result of our major project execution and strategic M&A has been that Pembina has continued to expand its footprint and add to the Pembina store, we've gotten better, not just bigger. We've added 20,000 barrels per day of new LPG export capacity off the West Coast with our propane sold into Asia. We continue to expand our Peace pipeline adding 460,000 barrels per day of upstream debottlenecking at pinch points across the system and creating full segregation across all 4 products. We've expanded our gas processing capacity by roughly 1 Bcf per day, including increasing our exposure to Northeast BC, and we've added 17 million barrels of storage. Finally, the recent Alliance and Aux Sable acquisition, we grew our natural gas export to the Midwest by 850 million cubic feet a day, and our fractionation capacity by 84,000 barrels a day. That growing footprint has allowed Pembina to deliver strong financial performance, including roughly 50% increase in EBITDA and a 30% increase in EBITDA per share. We've also delivered for our shareholders, including $7.2 billion of dividends and total shareholder return of 70% from 2019 to today. And the midstream industry has changed along with us. It's showing an evolving maturity, where balance sheet discipline is in focus with a preference for lower leverage and investors want to see self- funded free cash flow positive business models. There's a heightened focus on dividend protection and payout ratio preservation and an increased focus and scrutiny on financial guardrail strength and return of capital. While we feel like Pembina was an early adopter of the financial discipline we see across the sector, these changes still influence how Pembina thinks about strategy, new projects, funding in the balance sheet and capital allocation. Since 2019, we have lowered our debt to EBITDA from 4x to 3.4x to 3.6x. We've gone from free cash flow negative to free cash flow positive, and we've grown the dividend all while having a modest reduction in our payout ratio and returning over $9 billion to our shareholders. The E&P industry has changed as well over the last 5 years and grown stronger, more disciplined capital allocation means more predictable and stable growth and therefore, infrastructure needs. Reduced leverage and credit quality has improved as well across the sector. We have seen a wave of consolidation meant by smaller players by larger ones and more capable and better to execute growth. We've seen M&A lead directly to accelerated drilling and higher volumes from the acquirers. A key focus over the past year has been to strengthen and deepen our relationship with customers with a renewed focus on customer communication and service, which has led to strong recontracting efforts. The new infrastructure and new infrastructure is creating new export opportunities, alleviating what to date has been the biggest constraint on growth in the Canadian energy industry. And while the current gas market is challenged, well economics continue to be driven by high-margin liquid plays with quick payouts. We believe we have the right assets in the right areas to serve our customers, which Jaret's going to talk about in a little while. And since 2019, we have progressed our ESG strategy as well. On the E, decarbonization strategies rose to the forefront. We set our own target for GHG intensity reduction and the broader transition to a lower carbon economy has impacted how Pembina thinks about its long-term strategy. We have made progress with a 7% reduction in our intensity metrics. This is something that Chris is going to talk about a little bit more in detail a little later on. On the S, we rolled out multiple targets to enhance equity diversity and inclusion across the organization and at the Board level. We are meeting or exceeding most of our targets with still some work to do with our general workforce. We also have strong indigenous relationships, highlighted by our close partnership with the Haisla at Cedar LNG. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 3/37

And on the G, in addition to Canada's overall strength in corporate governance, Pembina continues to be recognized with strong third-party ESG ratings. Switching now to the macro, which we spend a lot of time thinking about. And while 2020 to 2021 showed a decline in global energy demand for obvious reasons, the overall trend has been positive and 1 of growth. That growth in all products, natural gas natural gas liquids and oil is expected to moderate slightly, but we believe in and many forecasts show continued growth through 2030. Third-party experts show global natural gas demand to grow by 34 bcf a day natural gas liquids by 9 million barrels per day and crude by 11 million barrels per day. The same growth we have seen and expect to see globally, we have also seen in North America as well. In particular, growing global demand and North American exports have driven growth across the WCSB. Since 2010, Canadian production has grown 20% in natural gas. Natural gas liquids are up approximately 45%. Crude has increased by 70% and condensate by over 100%. This growth is forecasted to continue to grow through the end of the decade, and we have confidence in these forecasts given the developments we will discuss shortly, the discussions with our customers and recent industry activity. You'll hear a lot today about the changes in the Canadian energy industry and how Pembina is poised to benefit from the resulting growth. Important to put the Canadian energy industry in context of the global energy industry Canada is not an island. What we are doing in Canada is a direct result of growing global demand. While the dynamics of global energy may be in flux, especially in light of efforts to reduce emissions associated with our energy. It is undeniable that global energy demand is rising, and that includes growing demand for oil and gas. While North American's oil and gas demand may have flattened, it is not declining yet. And Asian demand, along with demand elsewhere continues to rise. Amidst that backdrop, Canada has an important role to play. We are a reliable and responsible producer. We have large and cost-competitive resource base that is world-class in every aspect. And we are geographically advantaged with the best access to the U.S. and close proximity and a shipping advantage compared to other alternatives to supply growing Asian markets. We believe we have -- as we have for some time, that the time is now for Canadian energy. As I just mentioned, growing global demand for energy and petrochemicals is driving infrastructure opportunities in Western Canada that should unlock further growth in the WCSB. Later, Jaret will dive deep into each 1 of these, but the 4 catalysts we see transforming Canadian Energy over the next few years include the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion with 590,000 barrels per day, which supports oil sands growth and therefore, condensate demand for diluent. West Coast LNG with 2.8 Bcf a day of natural gas demand from LNG Phase 1, Cedar and wood fiber, and we know beyond that, there's the potential for another 2.1 Bcf a day for LNG Phase II and other proposed projects. And of course, with incremental LNG comes a significant amount of natural gas liquids that comes along with that gas production. We see LPG exports increasing with various projects on the horizon, which could add incremental demand pull and the petrochemical build-out continues in Alberta. We have the Dow path to 0 cracker, we'll drive new ethane demand plus associated propane plus production and recent third-party PDH PP developments drove 20,000 barrels per day of incremental propane demand. And Pembina is poised to benefit from this growth, given our extensive footprint, including a leading network of export, import and gathering pipeline systems with total capacity of 3 million barrels per day. Our conventional system transports crude oil, condensate, C2+ and C3+ our transmission systems, import condensate and ethane and exports natural gas and our oil sands gatherers and stores, heavy oil and synthetic oil. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 4/37

In addition to our pipeline network, Pembina has extensive gas processing, fractionation and storage facilities. Pembina gas infrastructure, the largest third-party gas processor in Western Canada, combined with our Pembina straddles processes over 6.3 Bcf per day of gas. Our Redwater fractionation complex is the largest fractionation complex in Canada and continues to grow. Aux Sable is a valuable extraction of fractionation in the Midwest market. And our Prince Rupert Terminal is our LPG export facility that allows us to gain higher value for our propane out of that terminal. Our significant asset footprint is not only made up of a diversity of assets across the Montney, Deep Basin and Duvernay, but it also positions us across all 6 commodities today. Natural gas business includes gathering and processing as well as export to higher-value U.S. markets and through our proposed Cedar LNG project, we hope to add global natural gas exports to this service offering as well. On natural gas liquids, our ethane business supplies resilient, Alberta polyethylene plants with a diversified feedstock. And our propane and butane business connects and oversupply WCSB to higher price North America and Asia markets. Our condensate business supplies resilient oil sands demand in a market with favorable pricing dynamics through advantaged assets. And our crude business connects long-life reserves to cost competitive value chains that insulate the WCSB production from demand destruction as long as Canadian policy remains competitive with the U.S. Pembina really is at the center of the energy industry in Canada. And we believe our service offering is unique. Our integrated value chain provides a full suite of midstream and transportation services across all commodity, which means Pembina is best positioned to benefit from the growth we are seeing and expect to continue to see in the WCSB. This means you don't have to pick a commodity. Pembina should benefit in any case, given our exposure across all commodities. We are the only Canadian midstream company that can say that, and it's something that we are quite proud of. And so what does it all mean? In our view, Pembina offers an unmatched business model and a unique blend of the attributes that make us a core energy holdings for any portfolio. We have a full value chain across all commodities. As I just touched on, we believe Pembina's service offering is unmatched across all 6 commodities. We have visible growth Pembina's assets and contracts position us to benefit from the transformational catalysts in the WCSB you're going to hear about today. We have financial discipline. We expect to grow our fee-based adjusted EBITDA per share by 4% to 6% on a compound annual growth rate, all within our financial guardrails. We have a predictable cash flow stream predominantly backstopped by long-term contracts underpinning fee-based take-or-pay cash flows with some commodity exposed upside. We have a long track record of project execution and delivering projects on time and on budget, and we believe that we're positioned for the future, building off of our 7-year history and exploring low- cost optionality for new energy extensions. So with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Chris, who's going to talk a little bit about our strategy going forward. Chris Scherman All right. As Dan mentioned, my name is Chris Scherman, I'm Senior Vice President of Marketing and Strategy, at Pembina. I'm excited this morning to have the opportunity to talk a little bit about our strategy. We went public 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 5/37

Page 6
with our strategy a little over a year ago, I think early 2023, late 2022. But we haven't really had the opportunity to expand on that strategy. And so the objective today is to hopefully talk a little bit about what our strategy is how we develop that strategy, how we continue to evolve that strategy and maybe shed some light on some of the things you can expect from us as a result of that strategy. Undoubtedly, we'll based on conversations last night and this morning, we'll fall short of some expectations that we share the exact capital and exactly how this is going to play out for the next 10 years. But hopefully, at least get an indication of where we might go and how we might do it. So a few minutes ago, Scott showed a forecast of global energy demand through 2030. And as we look out to the next 6 years, I think we've got a relatively high degree of confidence in how that market might play out, at least for business planning purposes. But we really are committed to developing -- operating, developing, growing a business going to be successful until 2030, thrive to 2030, but also beyond. And when we think about beyond 2030, it really starts to become a big question as to how markets are going to unfold post 2030. And you can see on the screen, there's a wide array of prognosticators and organizations and entities that will provide a perspective and there is a wide array of perspectives out there. And frankly, we have no idea how it's going to play out. So what does that mean? Well, really, what that means is when you're doing planning, when you're doing strategy work you've got a challenge in front of you. You can't really determine how things are going to unfold post 2030. And so we decided to address that challenge of long-term planning back in 2022 by beginning to do something we call others call it as well, strategy based or sorry, scenario-based strategy planning. And that scenario-based approach to strategy planning and strategy development. It's not a new concept. It's been implemented by others, and I think very successfully. And for us, we see it as a powerful tool to address the type of challenges facing our business and our industry going forward. So in traditional strategy planning, you designed around a single scenario. If things play out as expected, it can be very successful. If you haven't got it right, if you don't have the precision or the understanding of the future you might need, it's not likely to be very successful. So given that level of uncertainty for the industry we're in for our business specifically, we decided to take a more robust approach to strategy planning, and we use scenarios analysis to support our strategy development. The objective of that strategy work is really to attempt to be successful across a broad array of outcomes. So our scenario work and our strategy development is specific to our business. as we began the strategy work and we continue the strategy work. One of the priorities is to, in a very deep way, understand our customers and the markets we serve. As well, it's trying to get grounded in 2 key variables that are going to impact the long-term success of our business, the pace and decarbonization and the resilience of the markets we serve. So for each scenario, we really assess the challenges and potential options that exist for our business in the future. And the objective in the work is to enhance our planning process and hopefully improve our capital allocation for the long term. So given the level -- or sorry, pardon me. So we talked about how we develop strategy. And then I think in order to understand our strategy and to shed a little white on the decisions we're making under that strategy, I thought it was worth taking a couple of minutes to talk about a few of the factors and themes influencing our strategy. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 6/37

So Scott touched on a few of them. The first is that the global demand for oil and gas is growing, and we believe will be enduring. We see a divergence in global energy markets going forward. As the world continues to evolve the energy mix. However, we see drivers for global demand for oil and gas to continue. Population, economic growth, reduced energy poverty, digitalization seems to come up a lot these days. But at the end of the day, we believe oil and gas will be enduring because it's a very efficient source of energy, it's affordable and transportable and it's very difficult to replace quickly. That brings us to the second theme, which is that the energy transition is driving a shift in the global energy mix. So we strongly believe oil and gas is going to endure. We strongly believe the businesses we have today are going to continue to be successful, but that energy mix is changing. And so with that change, the challenge for us becomes how quickly and in what form does that change take. Policy, innovation, investment pace, I'll determine the pace or I'll determine how that unfolds. But at the end of the day, we're really trying to solve 2 problems. The first, providing the world with available and affordable energy so that it can thrive and the second, reducing global energy emissions -- or pardon me, global emissions. That brings to the third theme. Scott touched on it, and it's pervasive through everything you're going to see today. And that is that Canada is positioned to support growing global energy demand for both conventional oil and gas and we believe, for new energies as well. And so the WCSB is growing. There's some catalysts. We talked about -- Scott touched on. It was going to be expanded on further. But there's catalysts in the basin that really represent a key moment for our business and a key moment for Canada to participate in long-term growing energy markets around the world. Finally, Pembina's differentiated is uniquely advantaged. You're going to hear it from me, and I think it's going to be a theme as well that goes through today. We have a business that we love, and we think we're very well positioned to exploit WCSB growth today. We think we're very well positioned to access global markets going forward. And we think we have a role to play and a promising future, when we talk about decarbonization and an evolving energy mix. So a lot of the stuff I just touched on and when we think about scenario planning, and we think about these themes, it really is about an uncertain future. And I think that's something we pay a lot of attention to. But at the end of the day, I wanted to highlight the most important part of our strategy that we understand very well and isn't uncertain is that of our existing business. We've got great existing assets. We've got tremendous strengths and our strategy at its core is really an extension of that proven performance. Our strategy is not about pivoting, and I'm going to try to talk about that today. I'm going to try to highlight that. It's not about revisiting our core business. It's truly about leveraging the strengths and successes we have within our business today. And so we have a track record of success. And over the last 7 years, I think we've had a really exceptional track record, and that wasn't built by accident. That was built on the back of tremendous assets that was built in partnership with great customers. exceptional project execution and continued financial discipline. And those same advantages are what we're going to continue to apply in our approach going forward. So what is our strategy? And how will it create value? So the products we process and transport today are instrumental thriving global population, and we take great pride in playing that role. And so you can see, first of 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 7/37

all, with our purpose. You've heard it before for us, and you're going to continue to hear it from us because it really underpins the entirety of our strategy. Our purpose is to deliver extraordinary energy solutions so the world can thrive. We've captured our strategy in 4 key priorities, moving from left-to-right to drive strong returns from our core business ensuring our success beyond 2030, which is what I just talked about, maximizing the value of our products and our customers' products and benefiting all of our stakeholders along the way. As I take a little bit of a double click on each of those, strategic priorities. We start with to be resilient. We will sustain, decarbonize and enhance our business. I said it already, I'll continue to say it, we love our core business. Our core business remains a very important part of our strategy, and this strategic priority is really about improving and bolstering the resilience of that core business. We're focused on making it better and we're focused on making it more profitable. So when I think about sustain, what does that mean? It means continuous improvement. It means efficiency gains. It means cost savings as well. It means aggressively pursuing incremental margin from within our business. We really believe there is remaining intrinsic untapped value in our business, our core business today, and we're aggressively going after that. Third, it's about ensuring the stability and predictability of our cash flows through contracts. That's recontracting that's contract extensions, that's new contracts. And then finally, it's about continuing to deliver projects safely, on time and on budget. Moving on to decarbonize here, we're talking about decarbonizing our core business. This will ultimately improve the cost competitiveness of our business as well as differentiate our products and our services. And we're trying to enhance our business. We see a tremendous runway that Jaret is going to spend a great deal of time on today. We see a tremendous runway for growth within our conventional businesses and within our core business. And we've tried to highlight some of the recent accomplishments. I won't talk about every one, but Alliance Aux Sable transaction, RFS 4, 7% reduction in GHG intensity already. We're making progress against this strategic priority. Next, our second priority is to thrive. This is really about investing in the energy transition to improve the basins where we operate. To us, this represents an opportunity to expand our portfolio. It could include businesses that are associated with low carbon commodities, low-carbon infrastructure and carbon transport and storage. I want to highlight within this strategic priority. There's a tremendous opportunity to support our existing customers to leverage off of our existing customer relationships, especially when we think about carbon transport and sequestration, for example, where we can increase the resilience of our customers' businesses, thus increasing the resilience of our business and potentially create a new business line along the way, and I think that's pretty exciting. What you can expect is that our investments in energy transition will focus on opportunities, where we have a right to win. Stu is going to talk more about this later. But at the end of the day, we're willing to be patient as we develop this component of our business. and we're really focused on developing relatively cheap opportunities and cheap options to participate as these markets develop. With patients, we see a path to profitably participating in energy transition. If we have the right to win, we don't see the need to make sacrifices when it comes to returns or expectations. So a few of the recent accomplishments in this space, Alberta Carbon Grid is making great success. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 8/37

Page 9
Our low carbon complex, which is really about enabling the energy transition, similarly making great success. Our third strategic priority to meet global demand. This is about maximizing the value and resilience of our products and our customers' products for the long term. As Canadians, we're very familiar with the implications of isolated energy markets. And as we look further out into the future, we see a divergence between North American and global oil and gas markets. And that dynamic requires us to position ourselves so that our business can keep growing and continue to be resilient for the long term. We have line of sight to demand for conventional oil and gas in Asia, for example, as well as other growing global markets, and we strive to increase that connection to those markets thesis is relatively simple here. Accessing Global Markets increases our resilience and extends the value and durability of our business. In addition to global markets, we're seeking opportunities to transform our products to serve higher value and more resilient markets within Canada. It's not new for us. This isn't a new piece of our strategy. We've been at this a long time. We've got our Prince Rupert Terminal. We've been focused on getting product off the West Coast, for some time. And obviously, Stu is going to spend some time talking about LNG and Cedar LNG, which I think is a shining example of this strategic priority. Our fourth and final strategic priority is to set ourselves apart. This is about recognizing that a highly engaged workforce, the ability to attract key talent, supporting thriving communities highly profitable customers and shareholders that receive industry-leading returns are all critical to our success. We've been a shareholder- focused organization for some time, and we recognize the value in that approach. We believe that differentiating ourselves across all groups is an important part of our success. It has been to date, and it will continue to be going forward. What does that mean? A differentiated experience for each of our stakeholders can mean, among other things, we meaningfully contribute to the quality of life and happiness of our Pembina family. We have the capabilities we need to get the things done, we aspire to do. We have mutually beneficial relationships with the communities where we operate. We have profitable customers who choose us and want our services, and we have shareholders that receive stable industry-leading returns. We've got a plethora of recent accomplishments in this area that we're very proud of. When we think about total shareholder return, we've got a really strong performance. When we think about community investment, improved employee engagement, we're making headway and continue to have success on this strategic priority. So if we get that all right, what does it look like? Well, I think in 2030, when we look back, if we've done things right, if we've done what we expected to do, we will have grown and strengthened our core business. We will have improved the basin where we operate, both through margin improvement, increased profitability for ourselves and our customers. We will successfully executed a significant capital program on time and on budget. In addition, we will have decarbonized our business and achieved our 30x30 targets, and we will build an enduring portfolio that connects our molecules to growing resilient markets. In addition, we will have entered businesses with low carbon commodities that support growth and longevity for our portfolio. And we will have demonstrated top quartile safety performance, exceeded employee experiences -- experienced benchmarks and create long-term partnerships with indigenous peoples and communities. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 9/37

Page 10
Overall, we will have undergone significant growth, become more profitable and significantly increase the resilience of our business for the long term. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Jaret to talk about our core business. Jaret Sprott Good morning, everyone. Pleased to be here. My name is Jaret Sprott, Chief Operating Officer here at Pembina. So Chris talked a little bit about our journey to 2030, what are we going to look like as an organization. obviously, our core business is still going to play a huge role into what we look like in 2030. But I'm going to talk a little bit about what do we really need to focus on, on a day-to-day basis to ensure that we're able to do some of the things like enter into new energies, focus on expanding our footprint on the West Coast. And it really comes down to -- I'm going to talk about the left-hand side, the resilient portfolio and the differentiated stakeholder experience. If you take a look over on to the right-hand side, you will not have an enduring resilient, sustained core business, if you don't have a safe workforce, right? So ensuring that we have a highly diversified talented safe workforce every day is core to our business. We need to ensure that we have best-in-class customer service. It's not lost on us that essentially, we're an infrastructure company, but we are in the customer service business. Every day, our customers rely on us to move their products from wellhead into various markets across North America and in the future, more into international markets, and they rely on us for safe, reliable operations every day. Also, we need to ensure that we have enduring indigenous and community partnerships. We recognize that our business is going to be in someone's backyard, and we want to make sure that those communities are welcoming us to be a part of their community and play a role in their backyard, So if you can set yourself apart and you can actually provide a differentiated stakeholder experience, we truly believe that allows you to transition over to the left-hand side and be extremely focused on driving value, like Chris talked about, in your core business. We obviously want to focus every day on having a highly utilized cost-effective business for our customers. We want to be a continued leader in project execution, which I'm going to talk about a little bit more. We have a tremendous track record on project execution over the last 20 years, and that gives us an extreme amount of confidence going forward to enter into new businesses, but also continue to deliver on the promises we've made to our current customers, leveraging our footprint and reputation for sustained growth. We've seen a tremendous amount of growth with the egress constraints that we've had for the past, I'll call it, 7 to 10 years. I'm going to talk a lot about some of the major key milestone transitional things that are going to happen in our basin, which not only are we going to play a role in, but we're also going to benefit substantially in our core business. And then obviously, our commitment to our decarbonization of our core business for our customers and the communities in which we operate. So we truly believe that if we can get these 2 outside pillars key strategic priorities, if we can nail these that will allow us to focus inward and start to expand into new energies, focus our time in exports. Organizations that are having challenges with safety challenge with project execution, that takes your eye off the ball and that ultimately will not allow you to meet the 2 strategic priorities in the middle. So speaking about safety, obviously, it's foundational. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 10/37

Before I get into this slide, I did want to just touch on, you've probably all seen in the news currently, we're experiencing wildfires again. in the month of May in the areas and communities in which we operate. I can let you all know that right now, none of our assets are in proximity to any of the current wildfires. But as of last year, none of our assets really last year were in proximity to the wildfires. It was the concern with respect to egress getting our employees out of the assets. that's when you had to shut assets down. So right now, we're continuously monitoring and things are changing on the fly, but I can assure you right now that everything is in good shape. And we are significantly more prepared in 2024 than we were in 2023. So moving on to one of our foundational items with respect to safety. Having a highly engaged, diversified and safe workforce will be foundational to the organization to be able to move on. We have a continuous improvement approach to our safety learnings, very focused on occupational, those are the injuries that you would have process safety, that's maintaining high integrity within respect to your assets. And we're very focused on psychological safety. The ability for people to speak up and stop work when they see things that just aren't right or take a pause as we move forward to make sure that everyone goes home safely. In 2023, we had some great improvements, 35% reduction to our SIF rate. So that's your serious injury and fatality rate. We're proud of that. But we recognize that we need to continue to improve in this area. And we obviously have some 2024 focus areas around process safety, continuing to advance our operational excellence management system and really working with our contractors, our partners. We recognize we would not be in business without our contractors, building some of the infrastructure we need, supporting us in various roles across Western Canada and the United States, and we also want them to be going home every night to their friends and family. So this will be something we talk a lot about internally and something that I'm fairly passionate about, we are passionate about, and we're going to start talking about it a little bit more because we believe you have to be excellent in this space to carry on for the rest of -- of the rest of this presentation. Now so focused on safety, but we're also focused on reliability. I said previously, our customers, they rely on us every day, and we're in the customer service business. What you have here on this slide is our gas processing business, essentially PGI, our pipeline business and our fractionation hub Redwater, and it just shows kind of the averages of availability by quarter. And you can see that availability, meaning we're available to obviously take our customers, process our customers' products, et cetera. And you can see across the board, we have extremely high reliability. And that's not out of luck. Pembina spends roughly CAD 150 million to CAD 175 million annually, inspecting pipelines doing integrity work at our facilities, doing process safety improvements, et cetera, so we can enhance the reliability for our customers. Last year alone, we inspected 5,300 kilometers, internally inspected 5,300 kilometers of pipeline, so that's internal inspections. And then that will help us understand where we're going to have challenges, where do we need to do a dig, et cetera. So extremely proud of the work that, that group does. And we believe that between our operations staff, our maintenance staff and our integrity and smart technical folks, that's what's driving these extremely high reliabilities that our customers seek, when you have an integrated value chain. Obviously, a couple of the dips there. It's not lost on us in Q1 of last year. We had the northern outage. We learned from that. We shared those learnings with our industry peers. And go forward, we'll be a better pipeline 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 11/37

organization for that. And then in Q2, you can see a couple of dips. Obviously, it was the wildfires last year. We had to shut some assets down due to egress constraints that I mentioned. And then on the fractionation side, in Q2, we had a successful 15-day RFS 2 turnaround that was on time and on budget. That's just the routine 5-year turnaround, and that's a little bit of the dip there. But all in all, we're very happy with our availability performance and we hear the same feedback from our customers. Moving into the decarb space. So I'll take your attention over to the circles up on the right on the top there. Roughly 70% of all of our emissions are Scope 1, and they come from essentially 80% of that is the consumption of natural gas, right? That's just operating our assets, running compressors, heaters, et cetera. So we're very focused. That's obviously step 1, very focused on reducing the consumption of natural gas. There's a couple of things that obviously benefits your input cost your lower cost structure, not only for Pembina- wholly owned assets but also for our customers, where we flow through the cost structure to our customers. And then on the Scope 2 side, essentially all of our scope 2 emissions are using electricity, at various sites. And so just really focused on power optimization, et cetera, to not only reduce, and it's essentially to reduce the amount of power we consume, which directly affects the scope 2 emissions, but once again, reduces the cost structure, not for Pembina wholly-owned assets and for our customers. We've had some great successes to date. In 2023, we reduced our overall emissions intensity by 3%, 7% year-to- date -- or sorry, inception-to-date since we started from our 2019 baseline. So obviously, we have some work to do going into 2030, but we have a focused team now that is dedicated to understanding the cost abatement curve of all of our assets and we're going to be rolling that out to our board here in Q3 and then hopefully sharing a lot of that with you all in the future. So very excited and focused on our decarbonization priority. I'm kind of going along a theme here, when you have a really safe organization and you're highly reliable, that allows you to obviously to really focus your attention on areas that require it. And obviously, our project execution, project execution in Western Canada can be challenging. There's a lot of different types of terrain, there's a lot of different types of weather, forest fires, et cetera, but we're extremely proud of the project execution that we've had over the past while. And you know what it really comes down to a few things. There's no actual secret science for this, but having dedicated collaborative teams, who set out to achieve a unified outcome. We believe that we have some of the most talented people in industry. We obviously have a very vast knowledge of the area we've been operating in Western Canada that you saw the video at the start for 70 years. So we know the terrain. People know how to drill under massive rivers and stuff like that. So extremely talented team. And I believe what sets us apart is we have great partnerships with our contractors. The smart people who are drilling under rivers and providing services that Pembina doesn't have the expertise that's absolutely key. And then also our supply chain group that we don't talk a lot about, but we believe we've transformed our supply chain team into a strategic advantage, right? And having great project execution hopefully gives you all the confidence when we're announcing new types of projects that will continue on that focus and diligence. That leads into what have we got going on right now. Someone asked me last night, what are you up to these days, Jaret? Well, quite a bit. So kind of busy. We've got some pretty major projects that are supporting that continued growth. Happy to say the Phase VIII pipeline. I 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 12/37

think when we went to print, I told the team, let's put commissioning underway. As of 2 days ago at 4:00, all of the pipelines were back in service, taking our customers' products. So pretty proud of that. I think that project is -- we reduced the capital spend on that project twice. And I think we underplayed the significance of what we were doing in Phase VIII we swapped a lot of products into different sized pipelines. We changed directions of products. We know from Gordondale, Alberta, if you have a map in front of you, all the way into the Edmonton market Fort Saskatchewan, we have segregated C2 plus and C3 plus pipelines for our customers. No one else can provide that service to our customers. So pretty proud of Phase VIII pipeline. We obviously have a pump station up in Northeast BC happening. That's going to add about 40,000 barrels a day of incremental capacity for the -- I think we've talked publicly about 3 large producers that are dedicated to Pembina's infrastructure. So making sure that gets on the customers are pretty keen for that to come on. RFS IV, it's early, but with all of the dedications we have at Pembina and seeing some of this wave of growth coming, knowing that Dow is going to get sanctioned and LNG Canada is going to come on, et cetera, getting out in front of that and making sure that RFS IV is up and running when we need it for our customers. That was pretty critical. And then I'll just go down to Alliance and Aux Sable. We closed that deal on April 1. April 2, we had 161 new employees in our office at Pembina from Enbridge. So integration is becoming a core strength, acquisitions and integrations of Pembina's -- we're getting -- we obviously have some hiccups here and there, but the feedback from the employees is that this is just one of the best experiences they've gone through. So we're really excited about driving that first wave of synergies out of the Aux Sable and Alliance, acquisition and then really focusing on providing incremental services for our customers. Gas egress is one of the largest constraints. Alliance is a gas egress pipeline, and Pembina is in the business of owning and operating assets and growing them. So we're excited to hopefully 1 day start telling you about some of the ideas we have in that space. Obviously, North America, we have some of the best resource plays in which are obviously very close proximity to some of the largest growing demand markets in the world. On the left-hand side, you have gas resource plays. It's a payback period, and then you have the oil plays on the right. Pembina's infrastructure basically overlays the top 14 gas plays, right? And these plays aren't all the same. They're not all dry gas. They're not all uber liquids- rich, our customers, obviously, throughout the Duvernay and the Montney and the Deep Basin. They have various different types of resources they can go after depending on commodity prices when gas was really, really strong. In '23 we saw a lot of customers shifting to the higher rate gas wells. You still get extremely positive NGL yields with that. So that's obviously really good for PGI. We have paid on a processing Mcf and then we move more gas that comes out, the more NGLs that come with it. And then the customers can go deep into right now condensate it's very strong. So they're going into that lower rate gas, but high condensate. Overall, Pembina's infrastructure being able to process natural gas, move all the different types of NGLs move your condensate, maybe you find oil, we can also move that. So it's an unparalleled integrated value chain that can basically accommodate all of our customers' needs in all of these plays. If you look over on the oil side, obviously, not in as many of those. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 13/37

Page 14
But the top 2, it's the same resource. It's the Clearwater. And having your asset like the Nipisi pipeline, which we shut down, I think, in 2021, reactivating that. That's obviously going extremely well. We continue to see volumes grow on that asset and just continually excited to get that thing fully ramped up, hopefully, here in the near future. So where does that leave us, right? So here's the map of our infrastructure. And you can see our infrastructure basically overlays all of those gas and oil plays that you just saw on the previous slide. We've been operating in this area for about 70 years. I think it's going to be our 70th year birthday. And we're committed to providing our customers with that committed cost-effective, safe, reliable service every day, while maintaining our social license to operate in the communities here in Western Canada and into the United States. Scott talked about it, Chris talked about it. We've grown tremendously just even in like the last 7 years with the constraints that we've had, not only in Western Canada, but into the U.S. Midwest, and we're really looking forward to the next 5, 7 years out to 2030, as Chris identified, because of some key things that are happening in our industry, these are milestone game changers, and I'm going to talk a little bit about that and how we're going to benefit. So they're listed there. You can see Trans Mountain obviously, how will Pembina benefit at high level. Trans Mountain will hopefully drive incremental bitumen and heavy oil production. That production typically takes condensate for blend. We're one of the largest -- we are the largest condensate domestic mover transporter. In Canada, and we have a lot of space on our Peace pipeline and our ability to grow that system, add pump stations like our Northeast BC pump station, we can do those very accretively, and so as condensate demand grows, we would be there to catch the volume. Cochin Pipeline, there's 2 import pipelines that come into Canada, Cochin is one of them that we own. And just the high utilization demand for that asset will continue to be maintained. West Coast LNG obviously, with more gas egress, the customers aren't just drilling for straight up dry gas with that gas volume of 2.5 Bcf, 2.8 in Lots of NGLs will come, lots of condensate will come with that production. That's only going to be a benefit for PGI, the pipeline business, the frac, et cetera. LPG exports, we play a small role in that today. But we have the largest portfolio of propane proprietary and customer-based propane in Western Canada. So we will benefit from incremental propane egress and then obviously, the Dow path to zero cracker. Today, we move the majority of ethane in the province, we're a very large producer of ethane, and we're a very large supplier of ethane. So I'll get a little bit into the benefits to Pembina and some of the projects there. So Trans Mountain, I think, May 1 was declared in service. We could see -- with that 590,000 barrels of incremental egress oil egress, we see around 120,000 barrels of incremental condensate are required to fill to backfill the oil increase. Our Peace pipeline going out to the West, our reach goes all the way up into Birch, which is way up there in Northeast B.C. That's the only condensate pipeline that goes that far up. We have the 3 publicly communicated dedications up in Northeast BC. And then our entire infrastructure through once you get into Alberta on the P system, we have a lot of optionality to move condensate for our customers. We move a lot of barrels today, which obviously drives down the OpEx associated with that asset. I talked earlier about our high reliability, I believe that we have some of the best integrity and maintenance people. So we're in a really good position to capture a lot of those barrels and bring them into the Edmonton market for our customers. And then obviously, the Cochin Pipeline, when we acquired that, I think that pipeline averaged around 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 14/37

Page 15
90,000 barrels a day through the exact same people that I've talked about, the good work that they did, increasing the throughput of that asset. We've got that up to about 110,000 barrels a day that asset go forward. So this will just -- with TMX happening, that will just maintain that high utilization in Cochin for a really long time. So really excited with that asset coming into service. West Coast LNG. So between Woodfibre, Pembina and obviously, the big chunk is LNG Canada coming on here in the next few quarters. There's a lot of layers here, but essentially, gas egress is really good for Pembina, right? Why that is, it is because I mentioned before, primarily all of the resource between the Montney, the Deep Basin and the Duvernay, it's extremely liquids rich. Right? So when the customers do drill for their gas to fill this incremental egress, a lot of NGLs come and a lot of condensate come with that. This will be extremely beneficial for PGI. PGI, we have through our partnership with Cutbank Ridge partnership with Ovintiv and Mitsubishi. We have roughly 1.1 bcf of gas processing just outside of Dawson Creek directly connected into Coastal GasLink. Mitsubishi is obviously an owner in LNG Canada. So we just see really high demand for our PGI assets. And then obviously, like I said, the NGLs that are going to come with that. It could be anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 barrels of incremental NGLs that are coming. And our footprint, I stated earlier, with the completion of Phase 8. We have dedicated C2+ and C3+ pipelines all the way in from Gordondale, Alberta, and then we do have pipelines that go all the way into Northeast BC. So as the customers continue to fill that gas egress and white space that traditionally was full for gas that traditionally went down in the United States. And those customers in Alberta continue to fill that white space. There's going to be a lot of liquids coming at Pembina, and we believe that our infrastructure where it lies today is extremely valuable and ready to capture a lot of those liquids. I also just wanted to mention that here shortly in the next couple of months, we'll be finishing one of our last pipelines. And all the PGI gas plants will be fully connected to the Peace System. So it didn't take us that long to - - it took us a while to create PGI and then it took us less time to make sure that all the gas lines were connected to Peace. So pretty excited about that. LPG exports. So obviously, we have an existing asset today. There's another peer that has a really strong position in this space. But overall, I mentioned earlier, Pembina has a very large portfolio of proprietary propane. We extract a lot of liquids out of natural gas today at various assets, and Chris' team make sure that they get to premium markets. And then we also sell on behalf of our customers, a lot of their propane. So overall, more egress on the West Coast, getting it to the largest demand market in Asia will be a good thing, not only for Pembina, but for our customers. You may recall that Redwater fractionation facility, it is the only fractionation facility. It's the only facility period that has unit train capability to move unit trains of propane to the West Coast. So that's a direct shot on CN right from Fort Saskatchewan right to Prince Rupert. So as that -- that obviously gives us scale and a cost competitive advantage to get our customers' products out to the West Coast. And then finally, the Dow Path2Zero Ethylene Cracker. So a long time coming in behind the scenes to announce our 50,000 barrel a day supply. So back up a little bit. Today, there's 2 acquirers of ethane in the province of Alberta. We feed through the AEGS pipeline system. We feed 100% of that ethane to those customers today. And we also produce a tremendous amount of ethane. We supply a lot of ethane into that market through some of our deep field-based deep cuts and then our Empress extraction facility and our Younger facility up in Northeast B.C. Some of the benefits here, obviously, with Dow, they're going to grow the overall demand in the province by about 40% to about 100,000 barrels, and we're going to be roughly 50% of that on the supply side. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 15/37

Page 16
So what that means is that your ethane barrel, it needs to come out of, obviously, with the gas production, you produce the ethane barrel. But you can't just produce the ethane barrel in isolation. With that comes a lot of C3+, so more propane, more butanes, more condensates, and Pembina obviously plays a tremendous role in moving those and Chris' team selling those. So super excited about that. But then also the incremental 50,000 barrels depending on where that comes from. We're obviously well suited to move that and transport that on behalf of other customers into Dow's incremental Cracker. So this has been a long time coming. This is an extremely positive project, not only for Alberta and Pembina but for Canada, Dow choosing to build this here. So super excited and lots of opportunity, which I'm going to talk about a little bit. So some of the opportunities that we've identified, I'm not going to get into details, but we think there's about $300 million to $500 million of net capital we're going to need to deploy to obviously, enhance the infrastructure for third-party barrels that we'll be moving, but also enhance the infrastructure for our own 50,000 barrels of incremental supply. That will be through potentially incremental deep cuts, field-based deep cuts through PGI. That could be enhancements to some of our extraction facilities around Empress RFS-3, that is a C3+ frac today, but it's an identical replicate to RFS-2. So all we need to do there is just put the de-ethanizer infrastructure in at RFS-3 to get that basically to a C2+ 72,000 barrel a day frac. So lots of optionality for Pembina. So we're just evaluating what is the most cost- effective route to come up with our 50,000 barrels a day of supply. And hopefully, we'll be sharing more information on that here in the next maybe 1 year, 1.5 years. So what does that all mean? We've got great people. We've got great assets. We're committed to being safe and reliable for our customers. Our footprint is unparalleled here in Western Canada. We've been growing even in the face of egress constraints here in Western Canada. We've grown our footprint into the United States. We believe that we're very well suited to be able to grow as these kind of very large catalysts come on. And not to mention that those charts that show the gas place and oil place. This is a world-class resource that we have underneath our assets and Chris talked about it, but we believe that our core business, if we do this right, if we create a differentiated stakeholder experience, we're very focused and diligent on making our core business as resilient as possible. We will maintain that and grow that well past 2030, but that will allow us to really focus in on more Cedar type things, more export type things and getting into new energies. So with that said, because I could talk about this for hours and hours and hours. With that said, I'm going to hand it over to Chris Scherman to talk a little bit about our Marketing business. Chris Scherman All right. I'll be relatively brief, and then we can head for a break. So first, I'll just talk for a minute about where our marketing business is, what it actually does and then hopefully, a little bit about why we think it adds value to Pembina. And so the marketing business is really an extension of our Pembina store. And so marketing leverage is our integrated asset base and our value chain, both in pipeline facilities and terminals to access various commodities and really extract incremental extrinsic value from our assets. It's important as well to recognize that our Marketing business does deal with proprietary volumes, does support our business, but it also has a big role supporting the Pembina store and supporting our customers in marketing -- in marketing their products. So what do typical activities consist of in our business, buying and selling commodities take advantage of price location and time spreads really traditional arbitrage there. Utilizing our significant above and below ground storage assets, to capture value for both short and long-term price volatility. And then marketing and distributing NGL products, both in the WCSB as well as more broadly. And we're one of the largest NGL marketers in Canada. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 16/37

Page 17
And we certainly bring that scale and capability to bear in the market. So why is that important? And what value does that add for Pembina? So we truly do believe that marketing enhances the value of Pembina's business. We can drive incremental returns from utilizing the assets and from layering a prudent amount of commodity exposure on top of our asset base. As well, we like to talk about it as a natural hedge. And there's a few different ways that plays out. I think a good example that I've heard [ Cam ] used before is we like higher natural gas prices. Higher natural gas prices support our customer, customers support drilling support all the volumes that come come down our pipelines. And so for the long term, we want higher gas prices. In the short term, however, when gas prices are low, it creates an opportunity for us in the Frac Spread business where our feedstock becomes relatively cheap and we can do quite well on the marketing side and frac spread. Being in the marketing business also provides us with unique insights into the market, which supports both our general business as well as our investment decisions. And I think you've seen through examples like Cedar. It's also allows us to really provide commercial support to catalyze development. So with Cedar, we've taken a position in Cedar for the time being with the intention of leading that position, but ultimately allows us to catalyze development that we might not otherwise be able to catalyze. And then finally, it's really about expanding our service offering. So it's an offering to our customers to bring our size and scale to bear to support their business to improve their netbacks and to add yet another component to the Pembina store. So in short, it's strategically advantaged assets across our base. We've got a significant supply base. And when we combine that with fundamental analysis and a really experienced and capable team, we think it adds value for Pembina and frankly, adds value for our customers. So with that, I'm going to kick us over to a 15-minute break. So we'll break now and reconvene in 15 minutes with new ventures. [Break] Stuart Taylor All right. I think we'll get started here again. Again, it's great to be back, and we're talking [indiscernible]. It's been 2019 since our last Investor Day. Great to see some of the people here and again, an enjoyable reception last night. So I'm Stuart Taylor, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development Officer. I look after the New Ventures component of Pembina, and we've talked about some of that, as Chris has gone through the strategy and Jaret has talked about some of the integration. I'll go into a bit more detail on what New Ventures are actually doing. So we focus on the strategic priorities of thriving and meeting global demand. We're working on projects that are focused on decarbonization, new energies, meeting global markets that are adjacent and can be integrated with Pembina's core businesses. Some of these projects that you've heard of before, and we'll talk a bit briefly about some of them are things such as our carbon capture and storage, our Alberta Carbon Grid project. I'll talk more about that in the upcoming slide. We have been looking at energy transition fuels and chemicals that we look at placing our low carbon complex, immediately adjacent to our Redwater fractionation site. And lastly, Cedar LNG, and I'll talk in more detail about Cedar as well. I think one of the unique aspects of Pembina and as we look at these New Venture opportunities, one of the key things is that we continue to look to structure them commercially, that mirrors our core business, essentially fully contracted, primarily take-or-pay and based on a tolling model. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 17/37

Page 18
That takes some time, and that is, in many cases, that's not the current market that many of these facilities are being created in, but we stick to our plan of how to execute them and what our commercial models will look like. With respect to ACG, we've been working on this project for about a year and a bit. Again, just to remind everyone, it's a 50-50 JV with TransCanada. And the purpose of this JV is the development of CO2 transportation and sequestration for solutions in Alberta. Our first hub is planned to serve existing and future emitters in or around the Alberta's Industrial Heartland. We know we've made some progress. We did secure our evaluation agreement from the Government of Alberta in October of 2022. That gave us the access to plots of lands on which we identified as future sequestration sites. And we've been reviewing that as we go forward. We've been doing preliminary engineering on the compression and the pipeline right away. But first and the biggest progress that we've made is we actually completed our appraisal well in Q4 of 2023. And are currently processing the data that we did acquire by the drilling of that well for some subsurface models in 2024. I'm a geologist by background. I get pretty excited. I don't get to drill too many wells at Pembina. So that's pretty interesting. I will say the core porosity and permeability came in the data from there, compares exceptionally favorable to the current Quest sequestration project. We are extremely excited about what the data is telling us. And for those of you in the room, we have somewhere between this well has permeability in the [indiscernible] ranges. And as we looked and we test our injectivity, we actually have 2 cap rocks. This will keep the CO2 in the rest for the cap rock and the foot rock. And upon injectivity testing, we could not crack the cap or the foot rocks. So we have extreme pressure capability to inject large quantities of CO2 in those reservoirs. We're going to continue our work on the appraisal wells. The work is from the data and the subsurface models, how much more seismic do we need to shoot? How much -- where will we place our sequestration wells? How many will be required? And obviously complete our typical engineering on the pipeline in the compression. So that work will go forward in '24. At the same time, we'll begin our enhanced conversations with potential customers, those who have emissions, what are their plans for capture and how could ACG serve their future needs. With respect to our Low Carbon Complex, we've had the opportunity to work with developers to build the Low Carbon Complex. Again, on this map, it's the blue area, the highlighted blue area there. It's immediately adjacent, as I said, to our Redwater fractionation facilities. We're looking at sustainable energy infrastructure. We're focused on innovation, sustainable fuels, chemicals and this is where we would include our joint venture with Marubeni on our ammonia project. We were joking at the table. That land base gives you a size is 2,000 acres. It's large enough to host numerous world-class chemical facilities. And if you actually employ a shared service model of OSBL services, i.e., power, water and others, you could actually host many more. Conversations with table, I would say is that or we could host many, many data centers onto that site. So why are we exploring our low carb -- Low Carbon Complex. Again, it's customer driven. We have inbounds on a weekly basis of people looking to site future facilities. We believe that we can offer services that Pembina could build and offer. Those would include gas feedstock supply, water supply, other services that we are very familiar within doing. We actually believe it's a new growth opportunity to deploy capital. It enables to capture CO2 and would be a customer of ACG. It's a natural -- it's an extension of the natural gas value chain in many cases, again, feedstock and a demand sync for natural gas. It is diversification from our existing portfolio, many new opportunities. We are at the forefront in conservations of what innovation is taking place, what are the new projects, what are the new technology that people are looking to employ. We believe it's repeatable. We have the site in the area that 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 18/37

Page 19
numerous projects could be built on there. And it increases Pembina's brand as moving forward with new portfolios, new strategies and moving along in energy transition. I'll jump down to Cedar LNG, a pretty exciting project. I've been consuming lots of our time. It's the most advanced New Venture's project. We recently announced significant developments. And again, we expect to be moving forward with FID in June. Brief summary of the project itself, it's 3.3 mtpa floating LNG facility in Kitimat, British Columbia, entirely within the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation. The project is 50.1% owned by the Haisla Nation and 49.9% owned by Pembina. Pembina has been the developer, we'll be the builder and we'll be the operator of Cedar LNG. Commercially, we've underpinned the project with 20-year take-or-pay tolling agreements. ARC and Pembina have stepped up for each 1.5 mtpa. Pembina intends to assign its capacity to a third party in the near future post FID. We have contractors. We have an EPC lump-sum contract with 2 of, we think, world-class engineering and construction partners, Samsung Heavy Industries, out of Korea and Black & Veatch out of Kansas City. It's a lump-sum contract for the entire flowing LNG vessel. The cost estimate is USD 3.4 billion or $4 billion, including IDC. From an environmental perspective and one of the major changes that this project undertook, we were powered entirely by renewable energy from BC Hydro. And we are, if not going to be the lowest emitting LNG facility in the world will be at the very, very bottom of those plants. And that was a key value that we had to engage with and work with the Haisla along. We do have all of our regulatory permits, our key regulatory permits. And again, as I said previously, we were expecting to FID a project in 2024. Cedar financing has been launched and is on target for that FID timing. Critical product components are in place. We have very well-defined plans that have been completed and the successful execution of Cedar LNG is well on its way. The project advances, as Chris ran through our strategic pillars and where we're going to go and I mentioned. New Ventures focuses on thriving global markets, but we do believe we actually touch all of the 4 strategic priorities. The project advances every strategy as we go forward. It increases our exposure to lighter hydrocarbons that will serve the fastest-growing markets in the most resilient markets in Asia. It's one of the lowest emitting LNG projects in the world and will displace higher remitting fuel sources. It transforms Western Canadian products, i.e., natural gas and delivers them into higher-priced markets for our customers. It creates sustainable long-term benefits for the Haisla Nation, which we're very proud -- we are very proud as our partners on this project. Just briefly for the benefit, what are -- who is the Haisla Nation? We've had the privilege of being bidding on this project, being selected by the Haisla Nation. We've been working closely with them for the last 2 years. The Haisla Nation is comprised of approximately just over 2,000 nation members. The nation has been working on Cedar for over 10 years. They had the concept of -- and they took a chance and bet on themselves that they could get this project off the ground where they would be an owner and not just receiving your typical First Nation benefit agreements that would actually be an owner of the project. We embraced with similar values, the environmental aspects that would be required. And have minimum impact on the land, the air and the water as we build this floating LNG facility. Again, Cedar provides direct ownership and at the table participation in a major industrial development within their territory and will provide long-term sustainable prosperity for its members. And I'm happy to say, even the adjacent nations will benefit from Cedar and the job and employment contracting opportunities. This is economic reconciliation in action. Even with the floating LNG vessel largely being built in Korea, there will be up to 500 jobs during the 4 years of construction at site. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 19/37

Again, a dramatic decrease when you're comparing it to LNG Canada, they add up to 5,000 people on site. We will have 500. And as we get into operations, there will be 100 stable family supporting jobs available at that time. We have a brief video. Hopefully, it works, and we'll show you from about Cedar LNG. [Video Presentation] Thank you. I really love this line. This is the entire project. And it's been designed, as I said previously, to minimize land disturbance and reduce cost overrun risk by building the pipeline and the transmission lines adjacent to existing infrastructure and service roads. I don't have a pointer, but if you can just follow my arm waving, which I usually do. Our site is on the far top left. We have a very small marine terminal site. The LNG vessel will be moored approximately 70 meters offshore. And again, our site is small. It's essentially an electrical substation that comes in and the gas pipeline running through it. To compare that's LNG Canada site, which is kind of in the very middle of the page, to be fair, they are 4x larger than we are, but their footprint is dramatically larger than anything that we will do. People ask many times. So the pipeline in meter station, coastal gasoline comes into LNG Canada. You'll see the CGL delivery point into Cedar. There is a pipeline that we will build called CedarLink. It's 1.1 kilometers. It will be adjacent to the LNG Canada site. And coming into the Cedar LNG meter station. From that meter station, our pipeline goes along the area and then follows just north of a service road called the Bish Creek Road, along Rio Tinto site and heading to our site, it's 8.8 kilometers of pipeline. People -- again, 8.8 kilometers compared to 600 kilometers on Coastal Gas Link, a dramatic difference of infrastructure need. It is a challenging pipeline, but we've got -- we've been working on pipelines. We think it's something that Pembina and why the Haisla picked Pembina is our capability to build the infrastructure, the onshore infrastructure as best can be done. In the far right-hand side is the [indiscernible] power station substation. Our transmission line, 7.4 kilometers, 287 kV will go from that [indiscernible], again all the way to our site. The mooring system to hold a ship is a spread mooring system. It's been developed and used globally all over. And again, our Cedar LNG project, it's a dual-train liquefaction and we mentioned 3.3 mtpa. We have a very small footprint. We have a very controlled environment of which we're building and we break up and I'll discuss it a bit more our onshore infrastructure that needs to be required to be built. As mentioned, we have cost estimate $4 billion include gross capital, including IDC. We have $2.3 billion of that is for the floating LNG vessel itself, which is going to be built under a lump-sum contract with cost and schedule commitments. The $1.1 billion encompasses many other items, including things such as PST. We've also built in contingencies, which have been reviewed by independent engineers. The onshore infrastructure is approximately 1/3 of the $1.1 billion, and we're confident in our ability to deliver those projects on time and on budget as we've done with other Pembina projects over the last decade. Peak spend on the project, as you can see in the bar chart, is just over -- it's approximately $1 billion per year beginning in 2024, '25 and '26. As soon as we FID, there will be long-lead equipment orders and a lot of work being done in '24. Net adjusted EBITDA to Pembina has a range of between $200 million and $260 million annually. And as I say, in -- financing is ongoing, and we expect to have that completed in June for FID. With respect to the EP lump-sum contract, yes, again, we have a well -- we have well-defined plans for the execution of Cedar, 70% of our project capital is secured under a lump-sum contract with date certainty, construction certainty, and it's going to be built in Korea in an environmentally controlled shipyard. It's not a remote site. It's well -- there's obviously, it's controlled and we're confident in that build. The consortium of Black & Veatch and Samsung are probably have the most extensive flowing LNG delivery track record in the world. Samsung themselves have delivered the last 3 floating LNG vessels. Cedar has already 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 20/37

retained highly experienced project management commissioning and start-up teams with direct and proven successful LNG experience. We've had them on staff, again, floating LNG experience on staff for 1.5 years already. Onshore construction scopes, pipeline transmission line terminal, we'll ressemble Pembina development projects in terms of size and complexity. This part of the project will be executed using Pembina's proven project management and delivery strategy. So again, as we go forward and we reach our June FID timing, what are the advantages? Indigenous and environmental benefits this project delivers well above other LNG facilities. Competitive build costs compared to global precedent LNG projects, we can compete and was one of our goals is to ensure that we can deliver LNG into the Asian markets cost competitively with U.S. Gulf Coast projects. Cedar LNG lands in the Asian marketplace on cost-competitive pricing, both from an oil index perspective and on long-term contracts. Our economics are driven by and the benefit that we have is a structural AECO pricing discounts relative to Henry Hub. Our geographic proximity to the Asian markets, which Scott showed in his slides. Again, we're in a 10-day sailing time compared to the 20-day sailing time. If you can get through the Panama Canal. And if you have to go around the horn, you're up into the 30-day time frame. Those changes, every one of those changes is about $1 an MMBtu. Canada has abundant gas reserves, and Cedar LNG is poised to deliver responsibly produce Canadian energy to global markets by 2028. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Okay. Cameron Goldade Good morning, everyone. So now that you've heard from my peers, I get the opportunity to sort of take us home and talk about the financial implications of all this. And as you've heard from us, everything starts with strategy. And so when you think about what you've heard today, Chris, along with my partners, talked about our strategy. Ultimately, how we measure our performance against strategy is through financial performance, and we call that capital excellence. Capital excellence really comes down to 3 ingredients and one outcome. Firstly, we seek to grow fee-based adjusted EBITDA per share by 4% to 6% annually. We achieved this within our financial guardrails, meaning that we are not changing our risk profile. We increased the return on our existing invested capital, and ultimately, by doing these things, we believe we should generate industry-leading returns. If we execute on those 4 pieces and achieve this notion of capital excellence, and we believe we will remain at the front of the pack and relevant as the world evolves. So when we think about capital excellence, obviously, that goes hand-in-hand with capital allocation. Capital allocation reflects how we drive growth and returns and also manage our risk profile. At Pembina, it has and continues to start with the balance sheet. As you've heard, and we'll hear again from us, we have the track record to back that up as well. Maintaining a strong BBB rating has been a consistent and transparent priority for us. And again, we've shown that in time. Ultimately, a strong balance sheet has proven to be a competitive advantage for us because it affords us the ability to seize opportunities when they become available. For example, the Alliance Aux Sable consolidation that occurred earlier this year. Next comes the dividend. Our dividend is core to Pembina's investment proposition, and we recognize that our investors depend on it. In that regard, our objective is to produce sustainable, reliable and growing dividends, which is supported entirely by our fee-based business. Our next call for capital is on accretive gross capital. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 21/37

Page 22
This reflects capital, which adds economic value and extends and enhances our franchise and reflects the risk parameters of our financial guardrails. It's worth noting that growth capital must compete with other discretionary uses as well. And that's where we get to the last piece at the bottom of the slide here. After all those pieces, we will look at risk-adjusted returns for the remaining discretionary cash flow. This will include debt reduction, share repurchases, incremental dividends, and in the past few years, we've done all 3. And I think the reasons for that have often been judging based on internal factors such as the capital outlook we have, what risks we see or what opportunities we see in our business as well as what we see going on externally. For example, in the face of rising interest rates, we felt it made economic sense to retire debt as well looking forward to the capital opportunities that we have. Likewise, and we saw dislocations, we felt it was opportunistic to repurchase some of our shares and did that. And so we remain very disciplined about capital allocation, always looking at where the risk-adjusted returns are. Moving forward and coming back to accretive growth capital as it's obviously instrumental to our growth target, there's really three buckets that we focus on. And first of all, I'll start on the left and talk about the sanction projects that we have underway. Here, we highlight over $1.2 billion worth of major projects under execution. Starting with the Peace Phase VIII expansion and the Northeast BC Midpoint Pump Station, which come into service in 2024, obviously, as Jaret mentioned earlier today, a positive progress on the Phase VIII, and that is effectively online. Next after that, we've got our Redwater IV fractionator along with a couple of the opportunities in the Pembina Gas Infrastructure space, which come online in 2026. And again, returns on these projects and the commercial structure match what you come to expect and come to see from Pembina with returns consistent with historical levels. Next, we have a $4 billion suite of projects under development. These projects can be thought as highly probable, but not quite yet at FID. These would include our Cedar LNG project, our Alberta Carbon Grid, some of the ethane supply solutions for the Dallas supply agreement as well as our future Northeast BC system expansion, cogeneration facilities, and other laterals and connections. 3/4 of that capital roughly falls into the 2024 to 2026 timeline, which is why you'll see us highlight that timeline consistently throughout this presentation. There's obviously a balance between greenfield and brownfield projects. And again, the returns on these projects and the commercial structures match the types of experience you've come to expect and come to see from Pembina. And then finally, on the right-hand side of the page are the earlier-stage projects under evaluation. These are opportunities which are less advanced and yet provide foundational new business opportunities for Pembina as we evolve our strategy. So now as we think about the growth target, I want to take a moment in baseline on the near term. For 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA to raise between $4.05 billion and $4.3 billion, which, as you recall, reflects a $300 million increase from our original guidance for 2024, set back in December. As a result of the closing of the Alliance and Aux Sable consolidation transaction, that grew Likewise, as we've all seen, there's been positive momentum in the commodity space, particularly supporting a more robust forecast for our marketing business in 2024. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 22/37

Page 23
Likewise, we refreshed our current tax expense guidance for 2024, just slightly up by about $5 million at either end. And the reason for that, despite the outsized increase in the Alliance Aux Sable consolidation and the marketing increase has to do with the transaction structure and the U.S. basis that we have. Finally, we've updated the sensitivities to that adjusted EBITDA for 2024 and the balance of the year. I think the takeaway from these sensitivities is that, obviously, when you look at where they were for the full year compared to where they are now, they're relatively similar. That reflects, obviously, one quarter in the books. It reflects an increase, obviously, and essentially doubling the size of the Aux Sable platform, but also incremental hedges that we've layered on. And now that we have owned the majority of the Aux Sable platform and simplified some of the commerce there. We're able to hedge that business in a much more similar way to the approach that we take on our wholly owned business or our previous wholly owned business. And essentially, as you can think about going forward for the balance of the year, we've effectively hedged just over 50% of that Aux Sable business. So stepping away and taking a little bit longer-term view now, I want to talk about our approach through 2026. I spoke earlier of our target to grow fee-based adjusted EBITDA per share by 4% to 6% annually. And today, we're formalizing that outlook, using 2023 to 2026 as that proxy. Let me spend here -- spend a minute talking about why we've chosen that metric and why we've chosen that time frame. First of all, on the fee-based adjusted EBITDA per share, what you can clearly see is out of line with our strategic pillars, it's the basis of our strategy, it's how we orient our business internally, and it's appropriate that, that be reflected externally. Secondly, it normalizes the noise associated with forecasting commodity prices, which we've all heard and all experienced is subject to great debate. Thirdly, the fact that it's a per share metric, aligns very well with shareholder interests, provided the capital structure does not change, which obviously, I think you'll hear from me later, that we don't see it changing. And finally, it really isolates business performance from the core infrastructure business which I think is obviously the backbone of our business. So if I look at the guidance through 2026 of 4% to 6% EBITDA per share - - fee-based adjusted EBITDA per share. It really reflects a few points. One, obviously, growing volumes along with overall basin growth. Obviously, I think you look forward to many forecasters talking between the low to mid- single-digit volume growth range. And as you heard from my colleagues earlier the fact that we have the full hydrocarbon value chain across all the commodities, we feel like we're well positioned to continue to match that growth internally. Secondly, obviously, the integration of the Alliance Aux Sable platform and realizing the value and the synergies that come from that consolidation. Thirdly, margin enhancement across our business that Chris referenced and Jaret did as well. And what that really means is continuing on our path of operational excellence. It means finding ways to be more efficient. It means finding ways to align outages. It means finding ways to move more volume through existing capacity. It's really sort of working those pieces of a high-quality operator. And the prize there, it can be quite meaningful. Finally, mostly tailwinds, but obviously a few headwinds, one of them which we've already been clear about. Obviously, we had recontracting on the Cochin pipeline at the end of 2023, that has a moderate impact for 2024. And obviously, a full impact come 2025, as you get a full year run rate, obviously, that plays into this forecast as well. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 23/37

Page 24
One final thing I'll note is in this forecast, there are -- it's completely organic -- organically driven. There's no bolt- on or tuck-in acquisitions in here. Obviously, that's something that is part of our business, we're -- Jaret talked about integration being a core competency and always something that we can look for opportunities for. Switching to funding. Obviously, you can't speak to growth without funding. And the takeaway here is that we have the capability to self-fund our currently sanctioned projects, along with our Cedar equity contributions and our under development projects, all with cash flow after dividends. Likewise, if for some reason, the execution of those opportunities downshifts for whatever reason, we generate substantial free cash flow. So let me talk about the components of this for a moment. Firstly, you'll see on the far left bar, we have cash from operating activities of $9.1 billion to $9.9 billion over that 3-year period. This creates a consistent range around the annual outcomes similar to what we practice in our annual guidance. You're often used to seeing a $200 million to $300 million range in our annual guidance, and this range reflects that outcome as well. Obviously offset by some of the margin enhancement activity that I just talked about. Secondly, on the dividend piece, roughly $5.3 billion of dividends. This reflects both our common and our preferred share dividends and obviously reflects common share dividend growth over the period, along those same lines as well as preferred share rate resets in the phase of the current prevailing interest rate environment. Finally, the third bar from the right -- or third bar from the left, excuse me, would be capital and contributions to equity accounted investees. And as you can see, on that bar, we have roughly $2.2 billion of capital from sanctioned projects. That includes our growth capital. That includes our annual sustaining capital, and it also includes our digital investment program. When you layer on Cedar equity contributions, that being Pembina's share of the equity after project finance on Cedar and unsanctioned projects, that total over the 3-year time period gets to roughly $4 billion. Obviously, culminating in the fact that we are effectively self-funding through that period. And ultimately, as I said, if capital does downshift or shift out in periods, we generate meaningful free cash flow. So after we talked about growth and how to fund it, it's important to give you comfort that this growth does not come at the expense of a change in our risk profile. That's where the financial guardrails come in, as they're eventually -- essentially the financial risk parameters for strategy. I think most people are familiar with the concept of the financial guardrails, but it's really important that the proof points are here to show that they mean something. And so what we've done is, obviously, showed you those same parameters from 2018 to 2023, as well as where we are today. And I think the point I'd like everyone to take away is that, obviously, through that time period, a lot of change in the energy industry, a global pandemic and including the alliance in Aux Sable consolidation, over $10 billion worth of capital investment and yet well within the guardrails that entire period. I think you've probably gotten the theme from my colleagues and hearing from us that we're very big on doing what we say we're going to do, and this is the proof of that. This next piece obviously speaks to, again, the risk profile of our business and two points worth taking away from this slide. As you've heard from us previously, we feel it is a unique and differentiated characteristic of Pembina that we are balanced across the hydrocarbon chain, and we have exposure to all of the value chains. Likewise, our business is highly contracted with 65% to 70% of our business coming from take-or-pay or cost-to- service cash flows, obviously, with full revenue and cost protection or revenue and partial cost protection in those cash flows. I would invite people to dig into that stat with our peers. I think if you do that, you'll find that the 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 24/37

Page 25
stat compares more closely to the lower-risk peers in our space as opposed to those with more commodity exposure. Finally, on the fee-for-service and commodity-exposed cash flows, this really represents the fee-based cash flows, firstly, on top of that core take-or-pay or cost-of-service component. Where there is some volume exposure. And in some cases, we also have cost protection as well as on these cash flows. And then finally, the commodity-based cash flows really reflect the marketing business. To zoom in for a second on our leverage and our approach to managing the capital structure, I want to talk about the history. We've long said and long demonstrated that we have a commitment to prudent financial management and a strong BBB credit rating. And I think this chart -- this slide shows it. When we look at managing the balance sheet within Pembina, we look at it from multiple vantage points. One is a proportionally consolidated view, which obviously takes the proportion of debt both under the Pembina corporate umbrella, but also with our equity accounted investees. In many cases, notwithstanding the fact that these are nonrecourse lending arrangements. The second aligns with our rating agency methodology, ultimately as our financial guardrail is governed on the strong BBB rating. So on the proportionally consolidated debt for a moment, let me just walk through that. And obviously, Scott referenced early on that we went from 4x down to sort of below that level between 2019 and 2023. It's worth mentioning, obviously, that 2019, and if you recall, we closed the Kinder Morgan Canada acquisition late in the year. And so that figure reflects a disproportionate reflection of both, the full amount of the debt but only effectively 15 days of EBITDA for that. If you were to normalize for that, our leverage on a proforma basis for 2019 was about 3.6x, Again, very consistent with the previous year, very consistent with the trend. Obviously, the next year, 2020, we all remember that, that was COVID. And I think that sort of proves to the resilience of the business. Even through all that occurred in that, we took decisive action to protect the balance sheet, reducing capital, cutting costs, all without doing equity. Through 2021 and 2023, obviously, we reduced leverage as we foresaw increasing interest rates and capital opportunities coming at us and felt that, that was prudent to do so. And finally, as we look forward to 2024 to 2026, which is not explicitly on this page, what I can say is that taking the last slide into account and looking forward to our Cedar opportunity, even if you start to take the proportionate amount of nonrecourse debt associated with Cedar and include us in our structure and our leverage structure, we remain well below our 4x leverage level and the leverage does not change materially from this profile. Finally, I want to mention the FFO to debt or the second metric at the bottom of the page here. Obviously, if you look into some of the disclosures from the third-party rating agencies, we often orient to the BBB range, which is 15% to 20% FFO to debt. You'll note that our target is above that or stronger than that. And the reason for that is we've anchored to a strong BBB rating, meaning we've always wanted to stay in the upper half or the stronger half of that because, a, you never know what can happen. We can have something like a global pandemic. The world can change, and we've never wanted to put ourselves in a position where we get surprised by something within our control or outside of our control. And I think the track record again shows that. Third pillar to the capital excellence involves increasing return on capital. Return on capital is something that, again, is very crucial to the growth trajectory. For us, return on capital, again, is a proportionally consolidated look. And so we look at our adjusted EBITDA, which is proportionally consolidated against the proportionally consolidated view of capital in service. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 25/37

Page 26
Again, I think it's important to reflect that or recognize that for us, internally, when we look at this metric, this is an undepreciated view of capital and includes maintenance and sustaining capital as we spend it. And so for us, it provides a true view into the efficiency of our capital deployment. I think the track record shows here, obviously, coming out of 2020 that we've successfully grown and increased our return on capital. And how have we done that? Obviously, by integrating assets integrating acquisitions, integrating new assets, integrating organic investment by operational excellence by focusing on efficiency, on cost reduction, on utilization increases by margin enhancement along the same flavor, by synergies from the acquisitions that we've seen, brownfield investment as well as the upside in our marketing business. So obviously, I mentioned three ingredients and an outcome. This is really the outcome. We believe that if we do the other three, the fourth one really takes care of itself and should culminate in market-leading returns. And looking back, when we look back over a long period, we believe this is the case. What it shows is us consistently meeting and exceeding our industry peers and obviously providing a very strong and predictable return to our shareholders over time. Likewise, our dividend track record. This goes all the way back to Pembina's time as a public company. And as you can see, over that time period, our compound annual dividend growth rate has been 4.3% over a 25-year time period. This is a very long track record. And obviously, you can see that the dividend is core to us. I think what we also try and highlight on this page is that the dividend is core. And we are a distinguished few in our sector who have not cut our dividend throughout a conversion from a trust, in the significant incremental tax that came along with that through price collapses in our energy industry and through COVID. We're very proud of that fact. Likewise, we've accomplished all this growth, but at the same time reducing our payout ratio and increasing the sustainability of our dividend over time. Focusing on covering that dividend with our fee-based cash flow. So I have the opportunity to wrap up today and really bring it back to base principles. I would offer that, in our view, Pembina is a differentiated investment. As I said, there's a common theme of doing what we say we're going to do. And I think what you've hopefully heard today demonstrates that. As we see it, the distinguishing factors from Pembina are here. Firstly, we have a full value chain across all the commodities with integrated commercial framework, wellhead to market, which we believe provides and generates option value in the company. And over time, some of that value and that growth recognition you've seen from Pembina is a function of a realization of that option value. I think it also speaks to our ability to win opportunities. And an excellent example of that is our ability to supply Dow with a meaningful portion of their ethane in the future and all that will come with that. Next, we've got visible growth, underpinned by 4% to 6% fee-based adjusted EBITDA per share growth and obviously a multiyear trajectory. Fourth, financial discipline, underpinned by our financial guardrails. Next, very predictable cash flow stream, underpinned by a strong fee-based component, including 65% to 70% take-or-pay and cost of service. Likewise, all that is driven by investment underpinned by exemplary project execution demonstrated by $6 billion of on-time and on-budget investment since 2017. And finally, this all enables us to position for the future with the strategy for long-term hydrocarbon demand and energy transition. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 26/37

So with that, I'm going to wrap up. I want to thank you all for your time today, both in person and on the webcast. And I'd like to invite my peers up for Q&A session. Unknown Executive Hello, everybody. We have two ways to answer questions today. One is in the room here, and there are two microphones that will be mobile and will help you be heard. And then we also have a -- we have a feed of questions from online participants. I see a couple on the screen here that we could start with, and then we'll move back to -- in the room or we can start in the room. How about that? Please go ahead. Linda Ezergailis It's Linda Ezergailis from TD Cowen. Very interested to see your 3-year outlook, as outlined on Slide 68. I'm wondering if you could help us understand a little bit more some of the assumptions embedded behind that in terms of underlying commodity prices, recognizing that's even harder to predict maybe than what goes on in the capital markets especially through unforeseen scenarios. But how do you think about that range? Like what might push you towards the lower end of that CAGR, the 4% versus the 6%? And can you remind us what the current cadence of recontracting or maturities are recognizing that you've been doing a lot of blending and extending? Unknown Executive Thanks for the question, Linda. So I'll start and maybe ask Jaret to chime in on the contracting piece as well. So I think the big drivers for that range are, firstly, exactly -- and some of it, when you establish sort of a specific time frame, obviously, some of it comes down to timing as everyone knows, in this room. So that in itself is some of the uncertainty, whether we see something show up in 2026 or 2027, can obviously play into this. But I think our expectation embedded in that, as I mentioned, is an expectation across our business and across the base of low to mid-single-digit volume growth. If you look at our asset base, and I think most of the people in this room know, I mean, there's obviously areas of it where there is more white space as we call it, more free capacity than others in a couple of parts of our business. We're actually running at very, very high utilizations. Some areas of our business we have more capacity. And some we're working to unlock capacity and some of that capacity is just showing up kind of in that 2026 year. So as we think about that proxy for the basin growth, as Scott said in his piece, being the conventional business. Again, I think that low to mid-single-digit volume growth is probably a good proxy for both pieces of those ranges. Likewise, it has to do with the view and the timing of some of the margin enhancement opportunities that we see our broader executive team. It's been one of their core 3 focuses for this year, is crystallizing that margin enhancement opportunity, types of things that I talked about in my presentation. And so exactly when that shows up in what year is some reflection of that range as well. Obviously, this being fee-based, fee-based adjusted EBITDA, it doesn't have an explicit commodity sensitivity associated with it. What I would say is, and as you've come to experience from us, when we do our commodity outlooks, we just take the forward strip. We think that that's as right or as wrong as anything, and it's something that we can all see. So we use that. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 27/37

Page 28
So as you always see in the forward strip, there's always a backwardation and that will not necessarily show up in this. It will show up more so in our 3-year cash flow. But we also do take approach to say, okay, we recognize that there may be some conservatism there, and so we create a range around that. Jaret, do you want to talk about the contracting? Jaret Sprott Just a little bit on the contracting. So it's probably not something we don't talk about enough, but we're constantly engaging with our customers as they're rolling out their 2-year, 5-year, 3-year plans, et cetera. I think this is working. So constantly doing that, Linda, between now, mid-2024 and 2026. Switch that up. We don't have any major contracts actually coming up for expiry, but we did have Cohen, which was identified as a bit of a headwind, but we did contract that for a higher volume, albeit at a slightly lower toll. But like I mentioned earlier, we've actually got some extra capacity out of that pipeline from the time we acquired it. So there is IT volumes that can make up a lot of that shortcoming. But with all that said, we continually work with the customers, but there's not a lot of big ones coming up in that time period. Now as RFS II and RFS III come off, like those were 10-year contracts and that it was 2020 -- 2016, 2017, we'll be looking at extending those. But our confidence level in building like RFS IV, for example, or new facilities, pipelines, et cetera. We're always very prudent to make sure that the base assets are highly contracted for a long period before we deploy new capital. Unknown Executive Thank you, Jaret. Perhaps we can move to an online question now and then Rob will get back to you. Could Cedar LNG be expanded with the Phase II? Stuart Taylor So I think this is on. Yes, there we go. Cedar LNG, we are building our infrastructure, the transmission line, the pipeline, our terminal. We will -- it is designed for 2 Cedar vessels. It would be very easy. We'd love to use the same engineering and kick off another vessel. Our challenge at Cedar is natural gas pipeline capacity. The Coastal GasLink pipeline, we have guaranteed capacity in the Phase I with a compression addition, 400 million cubic feet per day for us to do Cedar 2, we need additional gas egress to that site. That could come perhaps on Coastal GasLink, interruptible service. It could come if one of the existing JVPs chooses not to go forward in their space, we could maybe secure that capacity. There are other pipelines that do exist that would need expansion. And that opportunity is there. And there are pipelines that are permitted another very large pipeline job to get done. But yes, Cedar could be -- the site at the site, we have space. Our facilities are built for double. We just need to work on a pipeline project. Unknown Executive 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 28/37

Thank you, Stu. Go ahead, Rob. Unknown Analyst [indiscernible] first of all, thank you for the presentation and the [indiscernible] today. I wondered if there's a particular response [indiscernible] that you can have or any [indiscernible]... Scott Arnold Yes. So for those on the phone that couldn't hear, the question was -- was there any gaps in the Pembina value chain that we're currently pursuing or looking at? And secondly, do we have appetite to expand off of a U.S. platform, I believe, this was the question, Rob is that correct? Yes. So on the first one, I think right now, we're pretty focused on expanding the store, but it's on all the projects that you heard today. So obviously, Cedar LNG will be a big piece of that offering. In addition to many of the projects that Stu's team is progressing in new ventures. That team is very busy. They have a lot of things on their plate, but they're early stage. Some of which we alluded to today, but there's many others that we didn't get into today. And that is always looking how to leverage our franchise, how to leverage our footprint, where do we have rights to win. One of the things when we did our revised strategy was making sure that any asset we looked at, we had to have a right to win. It had to be adjacent to our asset base. You weren't going to see us go off and do something randomly in the Permian where we have no right to win. So we're really focused around the core assets. Some of those were just too early to talk about today, but we do have a very active new ventures group that's looking to expand that Pembina store. As it relates to the U.S., one of the things we identified coming out of the Aux Sable transaction was in the future, end of decade, we will have our hands on, call it, 80,000 to 90,000 barrels a day of incremental NGLs and we'll have the right potentially to market those barrels. And so we are starting, just starting because there's still a lot of time to think about what it looks like for Pembina to have a Midwest NGL franchise, in addition to its Western Canadian LNG franchise. And so when we start thinking about the U.S., it's with the same strategy of it's got to be around our asset base, it's got to be an integrated value chain offering. And so logically, you point to our Aux Sable alliance assets and see what we can do around those. Again, we're not looking at new platform step-outs in the U.S. Unknown Executive Thank you, Scott. That answer and that question also addresses an online question with respect to our Alliance and Aux Sable platform and appetite to grow. Staying online, there's a question about referencing additional hedging at Aux Sable and what the hedging level for 2024 is and do we expect hedging at similar levels going forward, this is for Cam -- I apologize for Chris. Chris Scherman 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 29/37

Page 30
Also can take it. Yes. So we decided to take a similar approach at Aux Sable as we've taken with the rest of our frac spread business around hedging. So we're in around 50% hedged on the frac spread exposure both in our traditional frac spread businesses as well as now Aux Sable for the rest of 2024. As we absorb these assets and absorb this business more fully, we've obviously been in the business for a while as we absorb it more fully. We are paying attention to what the relative volatility looks like at Aux Sable versus our other business. We are paying attention to whether or not that's exactly how we want to run that going forward in 2025. But for now in 2024, we're 50% hedged effectively. Cameron Goldade I would maybe just add on top of that, that I think those who have been around the Pembina story for some time, may have heard us talk about a pretty disciplined approach to hedging historically where we would want to be 50% hedged by the time we set our budget in the fall for the upcoming year. We took the opportunity to take a second look at that in the past year or so, again, always in the vein of sort of continuous improvement and looking is there a way we can do things better. And I think what we came to recognize and agree on is that with our perspective into particularly the NGL market and the visibility we have into that market, we have the opportunity to use some of the market intel and market knowledge that we have to optimize that. And to use an example, for example, if you are at the bottom of a market at a sort of a P10 on a probabilistic level, would you still pile and hedge that same level, recognizing that there was probably more upside than downside, maybe that's not the optimal approach. Likewise, if you're at the other end of the spectrum, then you can sort of take a lot of profits and reduce downside, you might hedge more. And so ultimately, we -- in between, we end up probably in the same spot around that 50% level, but just trying to optimize around the edges to use our knowledge where it makes sense. Praneeth Satish Praneeth, Wells Fargo. I was just wondering if maybe you could comment philosophically on how you think about being free cash flow positive after dividends. Looking at the 3-year funding outlook through '26, it shows that you will be free cash flow positive even including Cedar. But I guess as you evaluate new projects, do you expect to stay within that band and stay free cash flow positive? Or are you willing to go free cash flow negative for the right project. Just trying to see if this forecast for being free cash flow positive. Is that just -- is a consequence of your funding plan or a new guardrail? Stuart Taylor It's obviously something that has evolved in our market over time. And even today, there are obviously multiple data points around this in the market. I think that we continue to receive feedback from our investors, from folks like yourself, Praneeth, that this element of self-funding is important in today's day and age. 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 30/37

Page 31
I think what we recognize and obviously, we put out the 3-year outlook is that like anything, not every year is exactly sort of going to follow that line. And over -- if we're slightly free cash flow negative in 1 year and free cash flow positive the next. I think over -- that to us is in that same ballpark. What I will say is I think when we've looked at opportunities internally, which could potentially violate that. It's been a major part of the conversation. And so you would have to see something truly transformational, I think, to get away from that because, obviously, as we've heard, it's very important. And so I guess, to really summarize what I'm saying is it's a pretty critical piece of our value proposition and our outlook and our planning continues to be anchored around that as one key ingredient. Unknown Executive Go ahead, Robert. Robert Hope Rob Hope, Scotiabank. I was hoping we could dive a little bit deeper into the ethane opportunity and kind of what the upside scenarios are for EBITDA. So I would imagine that there's roughly two buckets of kind of EBITDA generation would be your return on capital on that incremental $300 million to $500 million of capital spend. But it would also be an element of improving returns on existing capital. Can you help us understand kind of what the size of the relative opportunities are? Stuart Taylor Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. So we kind of actually see 3 separate cash flow streams. One is the incremental utilization of base assets such as the eggs pipeline, our C2+ system, et cetera, deploying incremental capital that will obviously -- to bring on the supply, but then also the actual incremental supply, selling that 50,000 barrels to Dow. So it's actually 3-pronged utilization, new capital deployment for our own supply and/or others and then the actual sale of the product. And then the fourth kind of leg of that stool is the incremental C3+ that will come a lot of that ethane that will be sold -- will be -- those will be primarily proprietary marketing barrels that will be sold through our marketing team. So those are kind of the 4 areas where we'll be generating returns, but we haven't really broken out which is which. Unknown Executive Rob Kwan, go ahead. Robert Kwan If I can just kind of go back to an offshoot of the free cash flow side of things. When you look at your proportionate debt to EBITDA with this build and the debt that's going to be accumulated at Cedar. You made the statement last year that first, the top end of the guardrail, at 4.25% is just somewhere you don't want to go and frankly, you don't want to be above 4%. So can you just talk about through the multiyear period on a proportionate basis that you don't exceed that? 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 31/37

Page 32
And then even just taking a step back as you think about new projects, in the past, there's been a willingness to exceed the top end, if you knew you were going to bring yourself back in. Is that still the case or for kind of almost a hard cap going forward. J. Burrows I'll take the second part of that question, and maybe you can take the first part. I actually think for Pembina. I think your comment is relevant for industry. One of the -- One of the things we saw, I'll call it, in the super cycle of growth from 2012 to '20 was people would build these major projects and you would be above your downgrade threshold with this commitment to getting below once the projects came into service. And what we found was typically projects went over budget or they were late or companies continue to grow, so you never really got off that treadmill because you were adding the capital, so you never really got below it. So we designed the guardrail specifically so that through that whole period and now as we look forward, that in our peak capital spend, so call it Cedar, where you've spent all the capital and you have none of the EBITDA, we don't exceed any downgrade threshold. And that's been core to us because there's -- we don't want to be in a situation where we're promising. We're going to get there. We're going to get there and then something goes wrong. And so a lot of our leverage metrics are designed to withstand big capital programs. Last year, when we were repaying a lot of debt. We often get the question why debt versus more share buybacks. And we were saying we're paying down debt in 2023, not necessarily to structurally lower it. but we knew that we were coming into what was potentially a heavy capital cycle spend just with all the growth opportunities we had in Cedar. And we wanted to go into that cycle with a really, really strong balance sheet so that when we reach peak capital spend we don't put or -- put our thresholds at risk on the balance sheet. So that's just a bit of a history of how we've thought about it and how we've tried to run the company. Cam, do you want to answer the second part? Cameron Goldade Yes. And specifically answer your first question, Rob, confirm that throughout that period, as we layer on and proportionately consolidate that Cedar project finance debt, we stay comfortably below 4x, certainly. And I think as you think about that range, and obviously, we haven't really gone above 4x based on the historical context. You could say, okay, well, is 4.25% really sort of the top end of the range? Or is it somewhere lower? We've opted to continue with that 4.25% range, recognizing the historical performance and where we're comfortable going. Also recognizing that you should never sort of ever take things right to the limit. And I think that's been our practice in many cases. Unknown Executive Thank you, Cam. We'll go online now. There's a question. It seems like you're well on track to hit your 2030 emissions intensity target. Looking ahead, how much more in terms of further reductions in emissions could you expect by 2035 or 2040? 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 32/37

Page 33
Jaret Sprott I'll take that. So I appreciate the well on track. So 7% kind of inception to date, I do want to mention that we have a tremendous amount of work to do to get to our 30 x 30. Past that, I would also just like to add that our -- a lot of our -- although we report our emissions, it's a pass-through cost for a very large portion of our business to our customers, the actual carbon [indiscernible] here in Canada. So to go past 2035 to 2040, that would require not knowing where policy is going, not knowing where our customers ultimately want us to go with some of these assets. It would be really tough to say. So I think right now, we're just going to focus on achieving our first hurdle of the 30x30, which will be some tough work. And then beyond that, I think we'll continue to evaluate where we need to go. Anything to add to that, Scott? Scott Arnold Just I mean we're doing the work, as Jaret mentioned, doing all of our marginal abatement curves and a lot of it's going to come down to the cost and what government subseas are available. I mean we're developing plans for all of our major assets to drive us to 30 x 30. The more you get on the fringes, the more expensive it is for marginal abatement. And so as Jaret said, I think the next call it, by the end of this year, we'll have a -- we'd have a view on this question of what it would take and what it would cost. But we still have a lot of work to do on our 30 x 30. So that's the focus right now. Jaret Sprott Then just further, I'll just add that through our analysis of deploying incremental capital either brownfield or greenfield and/or acquisition, we -- in our investment committee process, we have a lens now that we know what every acquisition or new capital deployment will it be a positive or negative to our emissions intensity. And so we take that into consideration as we're evaluating our capital allocation as well. Unknown Executive Thank you, Jaret. Ben, go ahead. Benjamin Pham Benjamin Pham, Capital Markets. I have some questions on your slide breakup, take-or-pay, fee-based my exposure, and I recognize it provide you resiliency over the periods ranks very well relative to peers. I'm wondering though, like when I looked at energy infrastructure names, the names that are trading on a healthy basis, strong balance sheets, which you guys have, but also take-or-pay regulated assets above 90%. Is there an opportunity for you guys then as you think about appetite for up in that take-or-pay exposure? And if it is, is there constraints in a sense by going there vis-a-vis lower growth, do you think about that? J. Burrows 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 33/37

Page 34
Probably I'll have a view on this question. I mean take-or-pays are something that we typically pursue I would say, historically, take-or-pays over the lower the risk project, usually the lower risk return. So you're bang on that one. But we have had a pretty successful track record of continuing to add take-or-pay commitments. When we think about some of the major successes over the last 12 months, some major recontracting at Redwater, recontracting on Peace, recontracting on Cochin, recontracting with Alliance. Those were all generally take-or-pay. So most of the agreements we're signing now are take-or-pay commitments. Cedar has the potential to add almost 10%, I think it's like 8% incremental take-or-pay commerce as well. So we do have a view of growing that over time. But it's always it's always a negotiation with customers depending on how much flexibility they need. We have some -- done some transactions that are areas of dedication. So those fall into more of the fee-based but the volumes are committed to us. So it's really customer by customer, Ben. But we have grown it over time and continue to push take-or-pay or cost of service type arrangements. Cameron Goldade And maybe I'll just add one point, and I'm not sure if it's embedded in that or not. I think some of those entities who have gone that way and maybe you were alluding to it, Ben, obviously, you have used utilities and that sort of structure to get there. Obviously, to be very clear, as you've seen from what we said today, that business is not in strategy for us. So moving and continuing to increase that component of cash flow would come from sort of our traditional business. Unknown Executive Please go ahead. Benjamin Pham The EBITDA and CAGR guidance [indiscernible] a lot of time iterations and whatnot and then that free cash flow estimate. Is that free cash flow estimates reflects a marketing backwardation? And then I'm also wondering, you guys frame as EBITDA per share, which is refreshing in a way because denominator there. If you deploy that $2 billion plus in share buybacks versus investing capital, are you neutral in a sense when you think about that? Or is the math changes when you do that? Cameron Goldade Yes. So the -- as you said, the cash flow forecast reflects -- I guess the answer is yes, in the sense that obviously, there's a range there. And you could say the lower end of the range would reflect some backwardation and some -- more of a downside case on that. Obviously, the upside of the range reflects some upside and obviously, some margin enhancement on top of that. In terms of -- and your second question again, Ben, sorry. Benjamin Pham If you were to take that $2 billion plus of excess cash, buy back stock, because the denominator changes now because it's not just an EBITDA story really when you think about it, -- is that -- are you relatively indifferent 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 34/37

Page 35
between that versus deploying additional capital? Cameron Goldade Yes. So I think to go back to my comments on capital allocation, the growth capital investment and the discipline on that is something that we're always testing against the alternatives, including what does it look like if we take that capital and buy back shares. I think the thing that we also test ourselves with and not lose sight of is the balance between the near term and the long term there. So obviously, you can create interesting per share gross in the short term by simply taking that capital and buying back shares. What you don't do, obviously, by doing that is enhance the value of the top line of your business and ultimately, the aggregate value of your business into perpetuity and not to go back a few years, but you sort of don't do anything to extend the terminal value of your business by doing that. And so we do balance that with that equation. I would say that in the short term, obviously, they're relatively close. In the short term, you -- you can all run the math, you probably get a little bit of benefit just from that buyback piece, but you sort of don't make any progress towards your other strategic pillars. And so we obviously think about all 4 strategic pillars as we allocate capital and take that into consideration. Unknown Executive Thank you Cam, Pat, go ahead. Patrick Kenny Pat Kenny, National Bank. You guys mentioned a few times today, you're very much in the customer service business. But your producer customers today are also under a lot more pressure to return their free cash flow to shareholders versus, say, 5 years ago. And I guess that made a lot of sense during the height of the energy transition phase. But now that we're in this energy expansion phase, is there something you're not doing today for your customers that you're thinking about, whether it's on the emissions front, the cost side or the egress side that could really unlock the potential for new growth out of the basin and help shift that narrative? J. Burrows I'll start, and then Jaret, you can jump in. I think the one thing we're really focused on is getting ahead of the growth. When we think about Northeast B.C., for a couple of years there, it was very locked up in some of the Blueberry River negotiations and other things that were really slowing down drilling. And now that's been somewhat alleviated and LNG is coming. The volumes are coming fast and furious. And so for us, it's about staying ahead of our customers and potentially taking, I'll call it, a little bit of risk to ensure that we're there for our customers. And a perfect example of that is RFS IV, where we had line of sight to volumes we probably sanction that frac earlier and with less contracts than we would have historically for RFS II and III. But because of some of the commitments we've made, some of the AODs we've made and some of the volume growth we saw that's something where we think we're going to be ahead of everybody else for the next frac to market and allows us to be in some pretty real conversations with our customers. And so we could have just 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 35/37

Page 36
stood back and waited until the customers needed it. And by that point, you're probably a year or 2 late, and your customers are frustrated. So we're trying to work with them and really stay ahead of them because with how efficient everybody is getting at drillings, the time from license to production is just getting faster and faster and faster, and we need to stay ahead of that. And as you know, on our business, especially on long linear pipelines and other items, it's getting longer and longer and longer to get something permitted. And so that's the real dynamic right now. And so having a good relationship with your customers where they trust you with their plans and where they're headed allows us to get ahead of that. I think the Anything you want to add here Jaret? Jaret Sprott I think the one additional thing, Pat, that we're doing, and I talked about it earlier about our supply chain team being a strategic advantage, really identifying. So -- and I'm getting a little bit into the engineer operating world, but what critical spares were in 2019 aren't the same critical spares as you have in 2024, meaning electrical components, transformers, those types of things that maybe were off the shelf in 2019. Because of the data center, boom, et cetera. So shifting our focus on how do we keep our assets at the same reliability for our customers and maintaining that critical spare list. That's one little bit of mind shift. And then the other thing is the we're of scale now, and we're getting better, we need to get even more better, but having integrated outages. So 3-year planning cycles for all of Pembina's outages and then communicating that to the customers, overlaying it with their 3-year plans and then allowing them to actually have outages at the same time as us is going in an extremely long way. We have a lot of ground to make on that, but that's a different approach with our customers as well because that integrated value chain is so important to them, them being able to do their maintenance work at the same time as us is pretty critical. It sounds super easy, but it's tough when you got 100 customers and 10,000 kilometers of pipe. Unknown Executive Thank you, Jaret. Going back online for a minute. Can you comment on the TMX acquisition potential? J. Burrows No. Cameron Goldade I think I'll just reiterate my comments from the Q1 call, which is that it's not something we're spending time on because there's just a significant amount of uncertainty. So probably leave it there. Unknown Executive Any more questions in the room? 3/1/25, 12:35 PM CA$56.24 Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PPL) - TIKR Terminal https://app.tikr.com/stock/transcript?cid=881430&tid=116210310&e=1880604342&ts=3132423&ref=l6cin7 36/37

Page 37
Unknown Analyst Just revisiting the ethane strategy here. Just want to talk about the deep cut potential capabilities and expansions. Looking at the partnership under the PGI, how that kind of looks going forward with the commitments with Dow? Jaret Sprott So, we obviously have 2 different types of deep cut assets that we refer to as our field-based deep cuts like our Saturn 1, Saturn II, Resthaven, Kakwa River, et cetera. So we have opportunities through the PGI joint venture with KKR to generate incremental EBITDA and deploy capital there that would supply barrels that could go into Pembina's ethane portfolio, move down the system, et cetera. And so the way we view that is that obviously, our PGI group, they have a fiduciary duty to the owners of PGI. So if that deal on a stand-alone deal is good for the partners and the owners of PGI, that would move forward. And then Pembina would obviously see the benefits of the value through the integrated value chain. The other side of the equation is our wholly owned assets specifically Empress and Younger. Those are -- we got about 2 bcf of ethane extraction there. So there's opportunities at those assets as well for Pembina to deploy 100% capital to extract more ethane, more C3+, et cetera, into that portfolio. All of that being said, in either of those cases, the liquids would flow through Pembina's infrastructure through transport would ultimately flow through RFS complex and then into the [indiscernible] pipeline, which basically ties in the 2 petrochemical facilities. So that's basically how we think about it. Unknown Executive There are no further questions online that we can see, and there seem to be none in the room. So with that, we can wrap it up. And we very much would like to thank you for joining us today. Really appreciate it.
